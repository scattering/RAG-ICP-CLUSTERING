Development and Validation of Scattering methods for Geomaterials The past few decades particularly since the advent of USANS have seen a significant growth in SAS for studying natural geological materials - from analysis of marbles for world heritage and antiquities studies to geological questions of water transport or understanding the processes involved in the gradual changes in earths crust and more recently investigations of tight gas shales for oil extraction and or carbon sequestration see Anovitz and Cole 2019 Many of these studies rely on the very wide q range length scales provided by combined SANSUSANS and complementary SAXSUSAXS techniques The advent of good user USANSUSAXS instruments has been instrumental in this development However there are a number of questions in the community regarding the interpretation of these data These range from the details of sample preparation to the methods used for data reduction and analysis The first problem stems from the fact that most rocks scatter very strongly at low Q and therefore if sample preparation is not appropriate multiple scattering becomes significant Thus samples are traditionally glued to a quartz glass slide and thinned down to 150 microns Anovitz et al 2009 However there is some concern especially for coarse-grained materials that doing so means that one may no longer be measuring the bulk properties of the rock Moreover because such samples are relatively thin may experimenters worry that the surface roughness may swamp or at least alter the signal from the bulk of the rock so most experimenters polish both sides of the sample the one glued onto a slide as well as the free side However some express concern that this process could significantly alter the morphology of the sample being studied - a problem that may vary as function of rock type In addition the type of glue used the method used to glue the sample to the slide and whether or not the glue penetrate the sample or even if the sample is purposely impregnated to stabilize it can affect the interpretation of the scattering if these are not well understood In order to avoid these problems therefore some groups have opted to eschew the thinning and instead crush the sample and place it into as thin a slab cell as possible Of course this too leads to questions about its relevance to bulk rock alteration of the sample during crushing and multiple scattering as such slab cells are invariably thicker than the polished sections Here we propose to begin addressing these problems by examining a series of samples focusing for now on the simplest monomineralic rocks which means avoiding things like granites and shales for the moment This will allow us to focus on the effects of sample preparation and analysis We also plan to do the complementary SAXSUSAXS measurements at the APS at Argonne on these same samples to compare neutron and X-ray results and potentially utilize the differences in scattering length density contrast to more clearly elucidate the problems described above Once we have established this as a useful test series we will move to more complex geological systems and organize through canSAS a larger round robin with various neutron and X-ray scattering facilities and geoscientists with different perspectives This has already been discussed at those meetings The results should pave the way for putting this rapidly growing SAS application on a more solid experimental foundation For this proposal we have chosen 5 readily available materials two carbonates and three silicates For the carbonates we have chosen the highly re-crystallized coarse-grained Carrara Marble from Carrera Italy a very pure white marble best known as the material from which Michaelangelo carved the David and the un-recrystallized very fine-grained Solnhofen limestone a lithographic limestone best known as the source of the source of the first feathered dinosaur fossil Archaeopteryx  For the silicates we have chosen two different coarsenesses of Arkansas Novaculite a quartzite recrystallized sandstone commonly used for whetstones and available in a range or coarsenessporosity levels and Berea sandstone a material commonly used for a range of flow and fracture studies in the oil and gas industry We will prepare each material in several different ways First we will vary the thickness using 10 30 75 150 and 300 micron thick samples mounted with epoxy on 1mm quartz glass slides The purpose of these experiments will be to ascertain when the material is no longer representative of the bulk the extent to which multiple scattering becomes a problem and how these may differ between materials In addition in each case we will obtain samples with both sides polished with the free surface polished and with neither side polished to ascertain the extent to which surface preparation is significant In the case of the highly porous sandstone we will also use two different types of gluing epoxy and superglue to the glass slide as well as purposely epoxy-impregnated material as there is concern that in some cases the glue might penetrate significantly and alter the pore contrast possibly as a function of pore size Finally for each material we will also measure a crushed sample of a few different thicknesses from as thin as possible using NIST standard 0mm demountable cell which allow for custom thicknesses Once the SANS USANS SAXS and USAXS measurements are completed the second stage of the project will be to begin looking at the effects of data analysis Different desmearing algorithms and analysis with and without desmearing and pore size distribution calculation approaches In this regard PRINSAS IRENA and MCSAS are the three most commonly used programs some of which contain multiple analysis algorithms Further we believe it is possible to perform the invariant calculation on slit smeared data by taking into account the slit smearing SasView and IRENA have already implemented this In principle this should produce fewer artifacts than attempting to desmear If we can show this is the case across the set of samples proposed this could significantly improve the quality of analysis on multi scale porous materials in general In order to do these experiments we will need to use both VSANS and USANS instruments to cover the full broad q range required for these analyses and to count long enough to obtain better-than-normal statistics Due to the quirks of the NIST proposal system we thus have to submit this proposal twice once to each instrument In principle any SANS could work for the higher q portion but VSANS will give better overlap with USANS if it is available We anticipate 6hsample on average for USANS and 50 min for VSANS 2 configurations the hi resolution detector option for 30min and one using 2 guides and extending to 025 1A for 20min Twice this amount of time would be required for the standard 30m SANS instruments The full matrix of samples would be 4 materials  5 thicknesses  3 polishing types  2 glues  12 samples crushed  132 samples Unfortunately this would require approximately 39 days of USANS time and 7 days of VSANS time which we realize is unreasonable Therefore we suggest measuring all thicknesses and the crushed series and will choose representative samples to test the effects of polish and glue if we need to limit our analysis to 45-55 samples With set up and backgrounds that leads to a request for 12-14 days of USANS time and 3 days of VSANS time REFERENCES L Anovitz and D
