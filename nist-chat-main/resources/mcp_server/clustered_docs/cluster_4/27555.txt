Berkeley Introduction Sedimentary rocks formed by the deposition of calcifying marine organisms are widespread on Earth and are important as reservoirs of energy and water resources and as records of the evolution of Earths climate over geologic timescales 1 In particular the stable isotope clumped isotope and trace element composition of marine carbonates can record past seawater temperature and composition eg salinity major element concentrations PCO2 PO2 etc and therefore sedimentary carbonates are widely used for paleoclimate reconstruction Following deposition carbonate sediments undergo coupled chemical and mechanical transformations that reduce porosity alter mechanical properties and redistribute elements and isotopes Petrographic analysis of deep cores drilled through sedimentary formations by the Ocean Drilling Program ODP indicates that burial diagenesis occurs in at least two regimes defined by lithification transitions that likely occur at thresholds in the overburden stress 2 3 Early diagenesis of shallow unconsolidated carbonate sediments ooze involves mechanical compaction and dewatering the recrystallization of primary biogenic calcium carbonate particles and the oxidation of associated organic matter At a sharp transition depth ooze is transformed to chalk a high-porosity rock in which the sedimentary grains have been cemented by authigenic carbonate Figs 1a and b At lower depths chalk is transformed to low-porosity limestone through a process believed to be pressure-driven dissolution and reprecipitation Pressure dissolution can drive substantial porosity loss and the creation of low-permeability seams called styolites Fig 1c Figure 1 SEM images of marine sedimentary carbonates from Fabricius 2007 A Partially or fully broken coccoliths from Stevns chalk with a porosity of 50 B Recrystallized chalk from Tor Formation of South Arne field with a porosity of 30 C Stylolite from the Ontong Java Plateau ODP Site 807 12752 m below sea floor with porosity of 22 Although the lithification transitions are clearly distinguished in the rock record we lack a general model for these stress and chemically driven processes that can alter the fidelity of carbonate rock paleoproxies and the capacity of carbonate rocks for fluid storage For almost-pure carbonates one-dimensional diagenesis models can quantify the rates of carbonate recrystallization using the exchange of trace elements and isotopes between the mineral inputs and the pore fluids but require empirical relationships between depth age and the rates of transformation 4 5 Moreover the roles of mineral heterogeneity such as the clay fraction and pore fluid chemistry cannot presently be modeled in a self-consistent framework 6 We seek an improved description of the diagenesis compaction and transformation processes that alter the mineralogy porosity and isotope and trace element records in sedimentary carbonates by explicitly considering the coupling between geochemical and mechanical processes that occur following burial We will combine advanced characterization tools to interpret geological records of the pathways of rock-fluid evolution laboratory-based experimental approaches to study individual mechanisms and multiscale simulation to develop a new generation of reactive mechanics and transport models Here we request access to ultrasmall and small-angle neutron scattering USANS to quantify the morphological evolution of sedimentary carbonates as a function of depth Recently we acquired preliminary USANS data from a subset of samples from ODP core 807 We discovered that the carbonate porosity over 1 km was described by 3 discrete populations of nanopores 10 m 10 - 30 nm and 02-10 m We observed a significant reduction in microscale porosity at the chalk-to-limestone transition as expected for such a significant lithological alteration data not shown here In addition we observed an additional porosity transition previously not observed in petrological analyses Figure 2 These preliminary data strongly indicate that USANS can identify and characterize significant mineralogical transitions  expected and unknown  in marine carbonate sediments We anticipate that this information will enable improved mechanistic models for diagenesis and compaction and will provide pore and surface information for new models not available from total porosity measurements alone Figure 2 Left USANS analysis of pore size distributions illustrating a previously unknown pore-size transition in the Ontong Java Plateau ODP site 807 Between 875 - 975 meters below the sea floor mbsf the data show a significant drop in nanoporosity  10 nm and the appearance of a population of pores of dimensions 10 - 30 nm Right Optical and electron microscopy are consistent with a morphological different between samples at these depths but cannot provide quantitative characterization Goals of the Study The overarching goal of our work is to develop a seafloor-to-bedrock model for the diagenesis and lithification of carbonate sediments The goal for this NCNR proposal is to use small- and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering SANS and USANS for quantitative pore size analysis of samples from cores obtained from almost-pure carbonate sediments 5 7 and from with cores exhibiting more complex mineralogy and composition 6 To our knowledge no prior study has sought to use neutron scattering or any other method to quantify pore-size distributions in carbonate sediment cores Experimental Plan We seek to use USANS to quantify pore size distributions as a function of depth from well-characterized ODP cores from marine carbonate plateaus Samples for analysis We will obtain samples from three marine carbonate cores from the ODP repository two marine sediments with almost-pure carbonate Sites 807 and 590B These samples will provide key constraints on chemical-mechanical models for carbonate diagenesis and compaction In addition we will acquire samples from one continental margin sediment in which the rate of deposition of clastic materials clays and other silicates is comparable to the sedimentation rate of biogenic calcite and aragonite Site 1082 These samples will Sample preparation for USANS Carbonate samples for USANS will be prepared as previously demonstrated for OPD carbonates Fig 2 and sandstone 8 Specifically 150-m thin sections approximately 4-cm2 surface area mounted on quartz Ted Pella impregnated with epoxy and polished on one surface Spectrum Petrographics Many of the carbonate sediments are either powdery or very friable and is not suited to the preparation of free-standing non-impregnated thin sections for H2OD2O contrast matching experiments Data acquisition and beamtime Based on prior studies by us and by Anovitz et al eg 8 we expect to require 25 hours acquisition time per sample or mask on the USANS line and 1 hour per sample mask or blocked beam on the VSANS line We seek to analyze 10 samples per core and 3 cores for a total time of 75 hours for USANS and 30 hours for VSANS Complementary analyses Numerous complementary efforts will further characterize the evolution of the carbonate sediments to provide constraints on the mechanisms driving porosity evolution and induration We will use scanning electron microscopy SEM of the same thin sections to observe morphological transformations and cathodoluminescence to distinguish overgrowth and cementation from primary biogenic calcite 9 We will use synchrotron X-ray tomography with resolution spanning 50-500 nm of sub-cored samples to investigate changes in pore connectivity References 1 Zachos J Pagani M Sloan L Thomas E  Billups K 2001 Trends rhythms and aberrations in global climate 65 Ma to present science 2925517686-693 2 Fabricius IL 2007 Chalk composition diagenesis and physical properties Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark 5597-128 3 Japsen P et al 2011 A compaction front in North Sea chalk Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth 116B11 4 Fantle MS Maher KM  DePaolo D 2010 Isotopic approaches for quantifying the rates of marine burial diagenesis Reviews of Geophysics 483 5 Higgins JA  Schrag D 2012 Records of Neogene seawater chemistry and diagenesis in deep-sea carbonate sediments and pore fluids Earth and Planetary Science Letters 357386-396 6 Turchyn AV  DePaolo DJ 2011 Calcium isotope evidence for suppression of carbonate dissolution in carbonate-bearing organic-rich sediments Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 75227081-7098 7 Fantle MS  DePaolo DJ 2006 Sr isotopes and pore fluid chemistry in carbonate sediment of the Ontong Java Plateau Calcite recrystallization rates and evidence for a rapid rise in seawater Mg over the last 10 million years Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 70153883-3904 8 Anovitz LM et al 2018 The effects of burial diagenesis on multiscale porosity in the St Peter Sandstone An imaging small-angle and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering analysis Marine and Petroleum Geology 92352-371 9 Barbin V 2000 Cathodoluminescence of Carbonate Shells Biochemical vs Diagenetic Processes Cathodoluminescence in Geosciences eds Pagel M Barbin V Blanc P  Ohnenstetter D Springer-Verlag Berlin
