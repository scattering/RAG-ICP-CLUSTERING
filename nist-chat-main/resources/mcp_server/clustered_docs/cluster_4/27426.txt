1 Understanding the OilGas Interactions in Shale Nanopores for Enhanced Hydrocar-bon Recovery An in situ High-Pressure SANSUSANS Study H Xu RP Hjelm CW Neil and EB Watkins Los Alamos National Laboratory Background and Significance Shale oilgas production in the US has increased exponen-tially from virtually nonexistent in late 1990s to about half the current domestic oilgas pro-duction with the projection of continued growth in the future  However the hydrocarbon recovery rates using the existing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing methods are extremely low  10 for the oil and  20 for the gas  which are apparently due to the small porosity from nms to sub ms and low permeability 10-16-10-20 m2 of shale for-mations  Shale nanopores are intrinsically heterogeneous and occur in both organic kero-gen and inorganic eg clay components of shale matrices It is important to distinguish ker-ogen nanopores from those in inorganic minerals clay and examine the expected different behaviors of their interactions with hydrocarbon and water fracking fluid as kerogen is gen-erally hydrophobic while clay is hydrophilic Since the walls of kerogen pores tend to adsorb hydrocarbon molecules they likely host most of the gas orand oil formed during thermal mat-uration processes Moreover some nanopores are fluid accessible while others are not the proportion and distribution of which largely determine the permeability of a fracture-free shale matrix Distinguishing open vs closed pores is important as a large portion of hydrocarbons may be stored in closed pores in shale access to which is critical for enhancing the hydrocarbon recovery efficiencies Currently these aspects are poorly understood driving key scientific questions on shale nanopore characteristics and how they may affect the behavior of the con-fined hydrocarbon fluids such as their bubble and dew point pressures which can be signifi-cantly modified from those of unconfined fluids Answering these questions will improve our estimates of the amounts of original oilgas in place and help optimize operational parameters for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery Objectives The overarching goal is to gain a fundamental understanding on shale nanopore structures and their interactions with fluids using an integrated approach of experimental and modeling studies The focus of this beamtime proposal is to probe the process of enhanced oil recovery EOR from shale matrix via the so-called huff-n-puff mode using SANSUSANS combined with a gas pressure cell More specifically we will determine the changes in the nanopore characteristics of shale which has been saturated with an oil beforehand upon pres-sure cycling of an injected gas In this context it is important to distinguish fluid accessible and inaccessible pores a characteristic that is uniquely probed by SANSUSANS  We will also assess the roles of kerogen and inorganic nanopores using a unique set of shale samples with SANSUSANS procedures that have already been demonstrated viable in studying shale openclosed nanopores using CD4 under pressure as a contrast fluid 5 Because of the limi-tations of traditional techniques most current knowledge of fluid behavior in shale nanopores has been obtained from computer simulations 7 with few experimental data available SANSUSANS data will thus provide the required validation of these modeling efforts and will serve as input parameters for our ongoing simulation of hydrocarbon fluid flow behavior at reservoir pressure-temperature conditions using lattice Boltzmann methods Previous Work In the most recent run cycle we conducted initial huff-n-puff experiments on the shale saturated with deuterated decane C10D22 our model hydrocarbon oil using deu-terated methane CD4 as an injected gas SANSUSANS measurements were conducted se-quentially on a dry shale sample the same sample saturated with decane and the saturated 2 sample upon introduction of methane at increasing pressures up to 500 bar and then decreasing pressure down to ambient conditions The obtained data reveal a length-scale dependent satu-ration of decane and its removal by methane when the sample was returned to ambient pressure Fig 1 The results have important implications on the recovery efficacy of oil from shale matrix under field conditions and also demonstrate the feasibility of our experimental approach Proposed Experiments We plan to build on the preliminary results by using a contrast-matching C10H22C10D22 decane solution to better visualize the pore spaces accessible to liquid hydrocarbons and methane as well as the pores where most hy-drocarbons are recovered We will conduct meas-urements on a series of representative shale speci-mens from Wolfcamp Texas and Marcellus Pennsylvania formations at the NG7-30m SANS NG3-45m VSANS and BT5 USANS beamlines accessing a wide Q range of 000005-05 -1 with overlapped regimes using a gas pressure cell that can achieve pressures up to 600 bar The shale specimens are thin sections with a thickness of 03 mm to minimize multiple scattering on quartz substrates The glue is only applied along the edge of the specimen so no neutron beam will be scat-tered from the glue which would affect the SANSUSANS data and have different mineral-ogy clay- carbonate- and quartzfeldspar-rich and organic contents The samples will be saturated with the contrast-matching C10H22C10D22 solution and comparison of SANSUSANS data before and after the oil saturation will reveal the distribution of oil in shale nanopores Then the oil-satu-rated samples will be subjected to pressure cycling using CD4 gas as the pressure medium to evaluate the effects of various experimental parameters pressure point dwelling time pressure ramp rate etc on the nanopore characteristics which are tied to the movement and recovery of the oil from the shale matrices Measurements will be made on increasing pressure from 1 atm to 600 bar in steps of 100 bar and then on decreasing pressure to ambient conditions Systematic measurements on representative samples will enable correlation of the SANSUSANS results with the mineralogy and production data of the shale lithologies One focus is to conduct com-parative measurements on organic-rich and organic-poor specimens to distinguish the interac-tions of organic matter eg kerogen and inorganic minerals eg clay with hydrocarbons oil and gas in the nanopores which are expected to be quite different owing to their distinct wet-ting properties The obtained results from the pore-scale SANSUSANS measurements will complement larger-scale laboratory experiments and provide input parameters for our lattice Boltzmann simulations Data analyses will follow the procedures developed by us and others for the study of material pore structures 4- For the above described experiments we request 3 days at NG7-30m SANS 3 days at NG3-45m VSANS and 3 days at BT5 USANS for selected samples based on the SANSVSANS results Figure 1 Comparison of SANS patterns of a clay-rich shale sample black the sample saturated with deuterated decane yellow and the saturated sample after being pressurized with deuterated me-thane and then depressurized to ambient conditions Note the decreasing differ-ences in intensity among the three pat-terns with increasing Q suggesting more efficient saturation and then removal of decane in the larger pores 3 References 1 a US Energy Information Administration 2019 Annual Energy Outlook with Projec-tions to 2050 wwweiagovforecastsaeo b Chaudhary AS Ehlig-Economides C
