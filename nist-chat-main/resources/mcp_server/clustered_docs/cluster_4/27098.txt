Fluid and Solute Confinement in Diatomite Nanopores Christopher Colla1 Larry Anovitz2 David Cole3 and Benjamin Gilbert1 1Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 2Oak Ridge National Laboratory 3Ohio State University Introduction Diatomite is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of the silica shells called frustules of diatoms single-celled photosynthesizing organisms 1 The importance of diatomite in geological settings and technological applications is mainly due to its high porosity imaged in Figure 1 and low permeability A large part of the oil and gas resources in California are stored in diatomaceous host rocks such as the Monterey formation 2 Diatomite has been used for decades as desiccant or filter but in recent years has become the subject of renewed attention for applications in energy storage water purification chemical transformation and chemical sensing 3 We are studying the chemical and physical properties of diatomite to evaluate the feasibility of the underground storage of fluids in diatomite formations particularly depleted oil and gas reservoirs 4 These geologic systems could provide locations for the permanent subsurface storage of carbon dioxide thereby reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions or for the temporary subsurface storage of hydrogen generated during periods of excess renewable energy thereby aiding California and other states in reducing the carbon footprint of electricity supplies Figure 1 Electron and X-ray imaging of diatomite A SEM images of a diatomite fracture surface coated in more than 10-nm of gold to enable stable imaging without charging Red square indicates regions magnified in subsequent images B Slice through a XCT reconstruction acquired at the Advanced Light Source beamline 832 of a 1-mm cylindrical core We are using a range of analytical methods to characterize the sizes and surface chemistry of pores in diatomite and investigate the properties of fluids confined within them Electron and X-ray imaging Figure 1 and prior studies 5 only revealed porosity contributed by the large 1-30 m frustrules and the submicron pores within them Our data strongly suggested however that water in diatomite experienced strong confinement effects Briefly we acquired water adsorption isotherms and water sorption calorimetry 6 in order to quantify the surface energy of diatomite silica We have performed 2H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR relaxation 7 and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy DRS 8 9 of diatomite that is fully or partly saturated with H2O or D2O The data collectively provide evidence that the hydrogen bond structure and dynamics of water in diatomite is strongly altered relative to bulk liquid water Nitrogen gas adsorption and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller BET method suggested the presence of a population of sub-10-nm pores but were not conclusive In order to definitively determine the pore-size distribution in diatomite we acquired ultrasmall and small-angle neutron scattering USANS at NCNR Using data reduction and analysis procedures that have been successfully applied to porous rocks 10 11 the USANS data showed that almost 25 of diatomite porosity is associated with nanopores with a bimodal size distribution Figure 2 These data are to our knowledge the first finding that fossil diatomite is nanoporous Chaika et al measured the trend in Monterey formation porosity during the diagenetic transformation from diatomite to silica opal types but did not measure the pore dimensions 2 This finding provides a clear interpretation of our data and has significant implications for fluid flow and chemical reaction in this natural porous silica First for example Fumagalli et al reported that confined water could exhibit an anomalously low static dielectric constant 13 which is a critical aspect of solute solvation and speciation We are presently investigating the chemical properties of aqueous solutions in diatomite Second changes in the hydrogen bond dynamics revealed by DRS suggest a change in the effective viscosity of water in diatomite that is qualitatively different to observation of water in swelling clay minerals 14 15 As described below we seek additionally USANS time to Goals of the Study The major goal of our research study is to relate pore size and pore surface chemistry to the properties of fluids and solutes in diatomite The goal of the NCNR research described in this proposal is to obtained detailed pore-size characterization from a broad range of diatomite samples that will provide critical knowledge for the interpretation of complementary studies of surface chemistry and pore fluid properties Experimental Plan We propose to survey diatomite pore size distributions for a suite of rock samples from California and international locations described below The USANS analyses will provide the first comprehensive quantitative description of pore size distributions in geographically biologically and diagenetically distinct diatomaceous sedimentary rock formations For example we will investigate whether nanoporosity is preserved during the transformation to opal polymorphs by collecting data for a suite of samples collected at various depths in a single drill hole Following collection and analysis of SANS data we will select samples for complementary studies of pore surface chemistry and water mobility Following the successful conclusion of this set of USANS experiments we will select key samples for a subsequent NCNR proposal for quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron scattering of pore water dynamics Samples for analysis We will collect core samples of diatomite rock from previously drilled and characterized diatomite-rich sedimentary rocks California Samples 200-foot long continuous core from the Pleistocene age Tulare Formation in the Midway Sunset Field MWSS San Joaquin Basin California selecting diatomaceous lithofacies with and without oil We will also sample Monterey Formation samples with known depthslocalities from the University of California mineral collections at Berkeley and Santa Cruz using prior nannofossil analysis to sample different marine species International Samples We will obtain samples from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1084 at the Northern Cape Basin that contains a 100-m interval of diatomaceous rich ooze Additional international samples of freshwater and marine diatomites will be obtained from Dr David Gittins Science and Technology Director of Imerys Performance Minerals Figure 2 Pore size characterization of one diatomite sample from NCNR USANS San Jose CA We expect to select 12 samples from each of these 2 cores and three collections for a total of 60 samples Sample preparation for USANS Diatomite samples for USANS will be prepared as previously demonstrated for the diatomite data of Figure 2 and sandstone 11 Specifically 150-m thin sections approximately 4-cm2 surface area mounted on quartz Ted Pella impregnated with epoxy and polished on one surface using a well-established commercial service Spectrum Petrographics Unfortunately diatomite is very friable so is not suited to the preparation of free-standing non-impregnated thin sections for H2OD2O contrast matching experiments and placing the samples in banjo cells is expected to yield significant multiple scattering on the USANS Data acquisition and beamtime Based on prior studies by Anovitz et al eg 11 we expect to require 25 hours acquisition time per sample or mask on the USANS line and 1 hour per sample empty mask or blocked beam on the VSANS line Thus for 12 x 5 60 samples plus empty masks blocked beam for the VSANS and instrument setup we request 3 days of VSANS time and 10 days of USANS time Complementary analyses For all samples we will acquire at least major and trace element composition X-ray diffraction determination of phase composition potentiometric titration for surface charge Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of organic compound classes SEM imaging of the polished thin sections and BET surface area and porosity analysis For selected samples we will perform at least water adsorption isotherm and water adsorption calorimetry dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and TEM imaging Subsequent beam time requests will be submitted for QENS and INS studies References 1 Hong Z Tateishi Y  Han J 2006 Experimental study of macro-and
