1 Probing Hydrocarbon Fluid Behavior in Shale Nanopores during Enhanced Oil Recovery with Very-Small-Angle Neutron Scattering VSANS CW Neil H Xu and RP Hjelm Los Alamos National Laboratory Background and Significance Unconventional oil and gas from tight shale formations have the potential to both provide consumers with cleaner energy and reduce the USs reliance on energy imports 1- Over the past decade shale oil production has increased from less than 05 million barrels of oil per day to over 4 million barrels of oil per day  However the US still imports half of its utilized oil to meet demands and shale oil production is predicted to decline in the 2020s barring the discovery of new resources or improved recovery technology  One proposed improvement is enhanced oil recovery EOR whereby a secondary sub-stance is injected into an existing oil well to increase pressure reduce oil viscosity and then extract the oil upon pressure drawdown It is currently unknown how this process will impact hydrocarbon recovery and retention on the nanoscale While neutron scattering has shown promise for observing fluid behavior in situ in shale nanopores integration of nano- and mi-cron-scale pore measurements has been challenging We propose to evaluate very-small-angle neutron scattering VSANS to bridge the spacial gap in high resolution measurements Current Status The coexistence of oil and gas within unconventional reservoirs provides a unique opportunity to utilize coincident gas production for improved oil recovery Upon drilling of a well production will generally decline hyperbolically because of limited diffusion of hy-drocarbons from the matrix nanopores after initial fracture flushing As a result overall hydro-carbon recovery rates using existing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing methods are extremely low  10 for oil and about 20 for gas  For wells focused on oil production it is often not economical to collect and transport co-produced gas and it is instead vented and flared  Proving the viability of shale gas utilization as the secondary injected EOR material will thus provide a more beneficial use of this resource Experimental validation is challenging as few techniques can measure shale response to EOR at resolutions necessary to infer structures and properties of nanopores and their confined fluids As a result most current knowledge of fluid behavior in shale nanopores has been obtained via computer simulations  Small-angle neutron scattering SANS is uniquely capable of vali-dating these models when combined with controlled sample environments to observe pore structure and fluid behavior changes in situ at EOR-relevant conditions This technique has been applied previously by our team to examine pore accessibility to water of mineralogically-distinct shales at high pressure 8000 PSI Objectives The overarching goal of our shale program is to gain a fundamental understanding of shale nanopore structures and their interactions with water frac fluid and hydrocarbon fluids using integrated experimental and modeling studies One focus of our work is to distinguish nanopores in organic matter kerogen from those in inorganic minerals clay and examine their differing interactions with hydrocarbons or water and in particular their role in hydrocar-bon recoveryretention For example kerogen nanopores which account for a large portion of total shale porosity are believed to be the major host for oilgas because hydrocarbons form from the heating of kerogen Mimicking EOR processes on the nanoscale can help elucidate how the injected secondary solution in our case methane will interact with oil in kerogen pores versus clay pores The experimentally determined nanopore structures serve as input for lattice Boltzmann simulation of hydrocarbon behavior at reservoir conditions 2 Proposed Experiments Previous experi-ments on representative shale specimens at the NG7-30m SANS and BT5 USANS beamlines have allowed measurement of a wide Q range of 000005-05 -1 How-ever measurement time restriction has resulted in high noise in the higher Q re-gion of USANS data making it difficult to determine overlap with SANS data In addition the USANS 1-D detector causes issues in analysis of anisotropic samples which are prevalent for shale 9-1 as opposed to the 2-D detector used for VSANS Understanding shale structure is a multiscale problem from the tens of m down to the nm scale Mitigation of these issues through the added use of VSANS will remove serious limitations on our ability to interpret results Trial VSANS meas-urements on one of our samples shows promise in utilizing VSANS in place of SANS to achieve better measurement overlap with USANS data Figure 1 Although this new data shows excel-lent agreement with the combined SANS and USANS the high Q VSANS data measured using the high-resolution configuration had poor statistics relative to SANS A more appropriate con-figuration for the high Q domain should mitigate this problem allowing for a comparable meas-urement range Furthermore because VSANS uses one measurement for the larger Q-range we anticipate that we may save up to a factor of two in counting time 1 For our preliminary VSANS experiments we plan to test what configuration of VSANS is needed to achieve statistics at high Q comparable to previous SANS results as well as evaluate how much time is required to obtain acceptable data over the entire Q-domain For these exper-iments we will utilize shale samples for which we have previous SANSUSANS data including samples from Wolfcamp and Marcellus formations as well as the Permian basin These samples will be cut parallel isotropic as well as perpendicular likely anisotropic 9-1 to the bedding plane We will use the data to enhance our ongoing analysis of SANSUSANS data Success in demonstrating the utility of VSANS will be a valuable proof-of-principle for application of VSANS on geomaterials with implications outside the field of fossil energy science The anticipated validation of the application of VSANS will largely relieve if not entirely re-place our requirements for standard SANS measurements Upon proving the viability of this technique we can utilize VSANS in our established experimental procedure for mimicking EOR using pressure cycling tests during which deuterated methane CD4 gas is pressurized and introduced into shale samples saturated with a contrast-matched deuteratedhydrogenated decane C10H22C10D22 solution to observe drawndown effects on decane removal The proposed experiments complement our work on in-situ characterization of shale nanopore structures and confined fluid behavior at field pressure-temperature-stress conditions 1 Ob-tained results will be combined with existing USANS data to reduce the analytical ambiguity of this multiscale problem For the above described experiments we request 3 days of VSANS instrument time Figure 1 VSANS conducted under ambient pressure conditions shows excellent agreement with previous SANS and USANS data 100E-02100E-01100E00100E01100E02100E03100E04100E05100E06100E07100E08100E09100E10000001
