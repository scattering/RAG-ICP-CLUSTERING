Title Etching of SiO2 during CVD of Thin Polymer Films Investigator Dr Jamie L Weaver Material Measurement Laboratory NIST Collaborators Laisuo Su Carnegie Mellon University Prof B Reeja Jayan Carnegie Mellon University Dr Joseph Dura NIST Center for Neutron Research Introduction -Intrinsically conductive organic polymers have been developed over the last several decades due to their usefulness in a variety of applications including antistatics Li-ion batteries solar cells capacitors organic light emitting diodes and printed electronics Of the polymers developed poly 3 4-ethylenedioxythiophene PEDOT has shown significant promise as a conductive thin-film reportedly improving battery cell cycling lifetimes by over 100 and enabling increased power conversion efficiencies in solar cells by up to 13 1  The improved performance of PEDOT films is partially related to the quality of the deposited polymer which can been enhanced by deposition onto an SiOx interface layer with a high ratio of surface terminated -OH groups 2  These sites are the scaffolding upon which polymerization occurs  However recent research has suggested that this interfacial region may undergo additional chemical reactions during and after polymer deposition  Theses reaction could also affect the quality and by proxy conductivity of the overlaying PEDOT film Investigation of these other possible reactions is the topic of this proposed work Background - Previously our team determined the density and thickness of a series of conductive polymer thin-films deposited on native SiO2Si wafer supports using NR Surprisingly all measured polymer types were fit with models that included either no or a significantly altered native SiO2 layer see Figure 1 for example with PEDOT and Table 1 for a summary of the previous NR results It is not known how the CVD processes could cause the removal of the native SiO2 The two CVD processes used in the study were initiated and oxidative and were produced following the methods in reference  Initiated CVD iCVD begins with the formation of free radicals by thermal decomposition of a chemical the initiator These free radicals absorb onto the support surface and are the scaffolding upon which polymerization occurs A commonly utilized initiator is FeCl3 which is known to load favorably onto hydrophilic surfaces with an outward oriented positive dipole moment species such as SiO2 Oxidative oCVD occurs in a similar manner but utilizes an oxidant as the initiator None of the initiators used in the study are known to cause SiO2 etching Another option for removal of the native SiO2 layer is a reaction between the polymer precursor and the SiO2 during polymerization Such organicinorganic hybrids between PEDOT and SiOx species have been previously reported 6- although in these studies the SiOx was introduced Figure 1 - Summary of best-fit-model Si PEDOT Air to NR data collected on PEDOT sample Note that the best-fit-model did not include a native oxide layer Data plots were produced by Refl1D 1 Table 1 - Summary of calculated neutron SLDs and CVD polymer densities All SLDs were calculated using a neutron wavelength of 5  and a Cu K source Uncertainties are reported to 1 Polymer Chemistry Chemical Formula Calculated x-ray SLD for bulk polymer Measured neutron SLD for bulk polymer Measured Density for polymer gcm3 68 CI for Density gcm3 Measured SLD for SiOX Layer PEDOT 6C 4H 2O 1S 025Cl 12686 2447260 1449 1446 to 1453 No SiOx layer utilized in best fit Co-Poly PPFDA-co-DVB 10C 649H 741F 078O 10872 243818 1279 1266 to 1281 2218792 PDVB 10C 10H 8785 129116 09601 0948 to 0972 No SiOx layer utilized in best fit Other Layers Neutron SLD X-ray SLD Si SiO2 2074 3469 20071 22724 in the form of precursors such as TEOS  or aminesilsesquioxane  and not via the native oxide The study with aminesilsesquioxane  was conducted using vapor phase polymerizationdeposition methods suggesting that such reactions could occur during CVD processes Additionally synthesis of other silsesquioxaneorganic polymer materials have been presented  One of the reported materials in  of SiDVB chemistry includes the other polymer thin film PDVB found previously by our team to have its SiO2 layer removed during synthesis The third polymer used in our previous study PPFDA-co-DVB has not been reported to form a silsesquioxaneorganic polymer Proposed Work - Provided our current knowledge we hypothesize that a similar kind of silsesquioxane producing reaction between the native oxide layer and the polymer precursors may have occur which resulted in the loss of the native SiO2 layer A multi-part study using a variety of techniques including neutron reflectometry NR x-ray reflectometry XRR and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS has been designed to test this hypothesis For this study samples with a thick layer of thermally grown SiO2 on an Si support has been selected over a thin natively grown SiO2 layer on an Si support as our previous work has shown that the CVD process can cause near complete removal of the native oxide an example of this is shown in Figure 1 Measurement of changes in surface roughness density and thickness of this thick SiO2 will be the focus of NR and XRR experiments These surfaces will be measured before polymer deposition to set a baseline initial chemistry for the layer and after deposition to measure any changes caused to the SiO2 thick layer during or after deposition The films will also be measured by XPS to determine if and how Si may have incorporated into the deposited polymer Neutron Reflectivity The combined use of NR and XRR is preferred in this study as they can provide complimentary insight into how the CVD processes may be changing the SiO2 layer Specifically we will be taking advantage of the pronounced differences in the neutrons scattering length densities and x-ray scattering length densities of SiO2 and the polymers to enhance our understanding SLD changes at the inorganicorganic interface A summary of the different SLDs for each material is listed in Table 1 Additionally longer count studies with higher statistics can be made on the polymer coated samples with neutrons as opposed to x-rays because the polymers can undergo a chemical change with prolonged exposure to x-rays 5 days of NR time are requested for these experiments with 2 days for the pre-characterization of the thick SiO2 on Si samples 16 hrssample and 3 days 24 hrssample for the polymer deposited samples It is requested that all samples be measured under inert conditions He as several of the samples can undergo oxidation reaction upon contact with air XRR will be completed in Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology NIST XPS will be completed in Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology NIST or the collaborating institution NR and XRR data reduction will be completed and Reductus 1 and data processing in Refl1D 1 Quality of fits will be determined by 2 and relative differences between calculated Bayesian Information Criteria BIC values 1 References 1 Sun K et al Transparent conductive oxide-free perovskite solar cells with PEDOT PSS as transparent electrode ACS applied materials  interfaces 2015 728 p 15314-15320 2 Zhang C et al Efficient Planar Hybrid n-SiPEDOT PSS Solar Cells with Power Conversion Efficiency up to 1331 Achieved by Controlling the SiOx Interlayer Energies 2018 116 p 1397 3 Choi S et al Quality Dependence of Vapor Phase-Polymerized Poly 3 4-ethylenedioxythiophene Nanofilm on Substrate Pre-Treatment Methods Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology 2014 1412 p 9005-9010 4 J
