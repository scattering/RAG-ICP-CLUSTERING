Scientist NCNR Eric M Davis Assistant Professor Clemson University Instrument High flux backscattering Spectrometer HFBS Nafion-silica nanocomposites Nafion-SiNPs have garnered considerable attention in recent years for effectively suppressing undesirable vanadium ion crossover in vanadium redox flow batteries without significantly altering the proton conductivity1 With readily available nanoparticle precursors this approach presents a pragmatic approach to scalable synthesis of ionomer membranes with tunable ion selectivity In Nafion-SiNPs the nanoparticles are traditionally believed to be preferentially sequestered into the ionic channels impeding vanadium ion transport via a size exclusion mechanism1 Furthermore Schwenzer et al2 have suggested that interaction between the sulfonic groups in the ionic channels and SiNPs could render many sulfonic groups inaccessible for vanadium ion transport leading to reduced crossover However recent investigations into the structure of these hybrid membranes draw contrasting observations Recent X-ray scattering3 and contrast-matched small-angle neutron scattering SANS1 studies on Nafion-SiNP membranes confirmed that the SiNP nanoclusters were too large to reside inside the ionic domains which are 5 nm in size Further with previously granted neutron spin echo spectroscopy NSE beamtime we measured segmental dynamics in hydrated with D2O Nafion-SiNP films synthesized via solution casting and the sol-gel method45 By analyzing the data using a semi-empirical decay function characteristic features of dynamics in these membranes were obtained and found to be dependent on silica concentration as well as processing conditions Figure 1 shows the intermediate structure factor ISF of a series of Nafion-SiNP prepared by solution-casting method where the data was fit using an empirical Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts equation which is commonly used to model diffused dynamics in glassy polymer systems bottom right Further the bar plots show a distribution of characteristic time scales of fluctuations of polymer segments in different nanocomposite membranes which allude to the different inorganic phase distribution in sol-gel and solution cast membranes as shown in the cartoon top left Figure 1 Characterization of segmental dynamics using NSE in sol-gel bottom left and solution cast top right nanocomposite

relaxation time tR are used to characterize changes in local fluctuations on the probed length scales the stretching exponent a and pre-exponent term A give indication of degree of heterogeneity in the dynamics and indication of relaxation events at a shorter time scale respectively As seen in Table 1 the pre-exponential constants  for all three samples are non-unitary indicating convolution of currently captured structural relaxation events with a secondary faster relaxation process This has been previously reported in NSE studies of Nafion membranes with varying degrees of hydration6 Interestingly the value of pre-exponential factor also varies with incorporation of silica nanoparticles suggesting that the hidden faster relaxation events are affected by interaction of the fluorocarbon chains with SiNPs Seperately counter-ion transport in hydrogenrated alkyl-ammonium counter-ion neutralized Nafion membranes have been previously investigated using high flux backscattering spectrometer HFBS and the mechanism of long-range counter-ion movement was ascertained to be ion-hopping which was also found to directly correlate to the a-relaxation in these membranes7 Based on these studies it has been hypothesized that the observed reduction in vanadium ion crossover is due to a decrease in the segmental dynamics of the hybrid membranes with respect to neat no SiNPs Nafion Since transport in nanophase segregated perfluorinated ionomers are expected to be coupled to the backbone dynamics these faster processes captured in NSE could potentially be correlating to the ion-hopping process along the polar side chains of Nafion-SiNP Thus characterizing the mechanism of vanadium ion transport in Nafion-SiNP membranes via quasielastic neutron scattering QENS as well as quantifying variation in the transport processes with incorporation of SiNP can help better explain the previously discussed NSE data and elucidate the nature of ionomer-SiNP interaction and how it affects vanadium ion transport through Nafion-SiNP membranes Furthermore as NSE results show silica phase is sequestered differently in sol-gel and solution cast membranes and so by comparing the transport processes in these two separate types of nanocomposite membranes we can expect to elucidate the nature of ionomer-penetrant ionomer-silica and silica-penetrant interactions even further We have previously collected QENS statistics on a series of Nafion-SiNP membranes prepared via the sol-gel method and are in the process of analyzing and publishing this data where preliminary results show that there is a significant slowdown in the hopping dynamics and the radius of local diffusion sphere increases on incorporation of SiNPs in the sol-gel membranes see Figure 2 We expect similar analyses with solution-cast membranes to contribute significantly in understanding the mechanistic origins of ion transport in these hybrid membranes Thus we propose to study QENS in Nafion-SiNP membranes solvated in excess of aqueous 15 mol L-1 vanadyl sulfate in 3 mol L-1 sulfuric acid to replicate battery conditions Three Nafion-SiNP membranes one each with 0 by mass 4by mass and 10 by mass SiNP loading will be prepared via solution-casting technique The QENS spectra will be measured using HFBS at NCNR in the energy range of  17 ev and a Q-range of 025-16 -1 Previously performed small angle neutron scattering and electron imaging studies on these SiNP loading in Nafion-SiNP membranes Pre-Exponential Constant Stretching Exponent

annealed orange triangles annealed with 4 by mass SiNP blue diamonds and 10 by mass SiNP green squares 3 nanocomposite membranes show that the ionomer structure is unaffected by incorporation of these SiNPs on the length scales of interest and they are uniformly dispersed in the ionomer matrix 189 Prior to performing QENS studies temperature dependent elastic scans using the fixed window mode will be performed for each sample at Q-values of 025 -1 and 12 -1 in the temperature range of 170 K to 450 K ramp rate of 1 Kmin to capture the thermodynamic onset of the ionic transport This will be followed by QENS characterization at 298K 323 K 373 K 400 K and 423 K thus spanning temperatures across the a-relaxation in each sample Here the quasielastic broadening of the energy spectra would correspond to the incoherent scattering from hydrogen atoms and could be attributed to protons transport as well as that of water molecules in the vanadyl ion hydration sphere and both these quasielastic events would be deconvoluted from the spectra through peak fitting in DAVE Further modeling of q-dependent peak shape parameters as well as elastic incoherent structure factors with a spherical diffusion model are expected to provide information regarding the vanadyl ion diffusion process From previous experience we estimate that each inelastic spectrum will take approximately 8 hours to obtain sufficient statistics On this basis we estimate a total beam time of 6 days accounting for sample changes and an additional day for collecting background and resolution statistics resolution will be collected in a dynamic scan using one Nafion-SiNP sample at 40 K where scattering is considered to be purely elastic Per our hypothesis ionomer chain dynamics are coupled with the transport phenomena that govern vanadium ion crossover through these membranes In conjunction with NSE experiments we have characterized the bulk swellingrearrangement dynamics in these nanocomposites using the time-resolved Fourier transform infrared- attenuated total reflection spectroscopy wherein a correlation between bulk viscosity of the different nano-segregated phases of Nafion and nanoparticle concentration is evident We have published two manuscripts and are in process of preparing another manuscript on this work and data from the requested beamtime would be a valuable addition to it We believe that these combined studies will provide a bottom-up approach to unraveling a holistic model for transport of aqueous penetrants in these ionomer nanocomposites References
