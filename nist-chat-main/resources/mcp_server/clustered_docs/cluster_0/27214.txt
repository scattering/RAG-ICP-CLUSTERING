 1 In situ Neutron Reflectometry of Water Uptake in Anion Exchange Membrane Films Proton exchange membrane fuel cells PEMFCs have emerged as the next generation energy technology for electrical vehicles EVs as they can achieve an energy conversion efficiency about three times higher than that of internal combustion engines ICEs However the high cost of Pt and Pd based catalyst in PEMFCs precludes their utilization in large-scale manufacturing Alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells AEMFCs have attracted increasing attention as a promising alternative to PEMFCs as their high pH environment enables the use of non-precious metal catalysts such as transition metal oxides and metal oxynitridescarbides which significantly lower the cost of production  The alkaline anion exchange membrane AAEM is a key component of AEMFCs but their low hydroxide ionic conductivity and poor long-term stability have limited their wide-spread application  The cationic functional groups are the major component in AAEMs that are prone to alkaline degradation In order to increase the AAEMs stability we have incorporated multi-substituted imidazolium cations into polyethylene backbones to produce stable AAEMs  Very recently we reported on the synthesis of highly conductive and chemically stable AAEMs from the living polymerization of trans-cyclooctenes A trans-cyclooctene-fused imidazolium monomer was designed and synthesized at the multi-gram scale Using these highly ring-strained monomers we produced a range of block HB-xy random HR-xy and cross-linked copolymers HC-xy Figure 1 Detailed synthetic procedures are described in reference 4 The capability of synthesizing block copolymers enabled us to adjust the microphase separation structures of the polymers to improve their hydroxide ionic conductivity Surprisingly AAEMs made from the random copolymer HR-1056200 exhibited much higher conductivities than their block copolymer analogs HB-1072200 while AAEMs with cross-linked random architectures gave the best performance HC-498200 Table 1 More importantly the membranes exhibited excellent chemical stability No chemical degradation was detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy when the materials were treated with 2 M KOH in CD3OH at 80 C for 30 days Figure 2A To understand why the random copolymers outperformed the analogous block copolymers the AAEMs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy TEM and small-angle X-ray scattering SAXS Figure 2B-C The counter anions were exchanged with iodide ions to provide Figure 2 A Alkaline stability test

groups in the TEM images As shown in Figures 2BA-B the block copolymer sample displayed aggregation of ionic domains creating a disordered microphase separation This microphase separation in HB-1072200 likely causes the membranes poor hydroxide ion conductivity as the large hydrophobic domains separate the hydrophilic domains and impede hydroxide ionic transport In contrast to the block copolymer the random AAEM HR-1056200 showed an amorphous and generally uniform morphology Figures 2BC-D The ionic clusters present in the random copolymer samples appeared to be well mixed at nanometer length-scales without large regions showing lighter or darker contrast The domain segregation was also characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering SAXS Figure 2C which showed broad peaks corresponding to ca 13 nm and 9 nm domain sizes for HR-1056 200 and HC-498200 respectively No peak was evident for HB-1072200 Its segregated domains observed in the TEM images were too large for a corresponding diffraction peak if present to be resolved in these SAXS profiles In addition to phase segregation water in AAEMs also plays an important role not only in anion conductivity but also in mechanical toughness and reaction kinetics since water is a reactant As shown by the water uptake and anion conductivity data of different polymers Table 1 a higher conductivity might be related to the higher water uptake in AAEM membranes On the other hand our preliminary acoustic impedance studies of the viscoelastic effectsproperties of a similar piperidinium-based AAEM indicated that water results in greater dissipation to the oscillation of an AAEM-film coated QCM electrode as indicated by the smaller admittance locus in Figure 3 as a function of the films dry thickness This suggests a decrease in mechanical toughness with increasing amounts of water absorbed in the AAEM As mentioned above a higher water uptake resulted in higher conductivity in AAEMs while a lower water uptake enhanced the mechanical strength Thus it is worthwhile to study the relationship between the films morphology and the level of water uptake at the ionomerelectrode interface The water distribution at the ionomerelectrode interface of AAEMs with different morphology may provide valuable insights to the trade-off between conductivity and mechanical toughness with respect to the levels of water uptake Neutron reflectometry NR has been previously used as a non-destructive tool to study the relative humidity RH dependence of complex polymeric morphologies multi-lamellar phase segregation and composition depth profile of fuel cell membranes like Nafion 5- These properties are critically important in AAEM design and fuel cell performance AAEMs are hydrated during the operation of AEMFCs and as mentioned above the hydration level of AAEMs not only changes their anion conductivity but also affects their mechanical strength To our knowledge similar experiments have not been reported for AAEMs In our proposed experiments at NIST we would like to study the ionomerelectrode interface and water uptake in crystalline and Table 1 Summary of AAEM synthesis and properties S m les a IEC mmol
