Meni Wanunu Mehrnaz Mojtabavi Armin VahidMohammadi Majid Beidaghi Characterization of Cation DeIntercalation in MXenes Membranes Under Applied Voltage Using Neutron Reflectivity Nanopore-based sensing of biomolecules using solid membranes that mimic their biological counterparts has gained a lot of attention over the past decade Nanopore membranes based on two-dimensional 2D materials can theoretically provide the highest detection resolution Recently we have demonstrated1 the application of 2D Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx membranes in nanopore biosensing These compositions belong to a group of 2D materials known as MXenes MXenes are a family of 2D metal carbides and nitrides with functionalized surfaces terminated with O OH and F that pose metallic conductivity The general formula for MXenes is Mn1XnTx M is a transition metal X is carbon or nitrogen n can be 1-3 and Tx represents functional groups present at their surfaces2 The intrinsic limitation in the maximum resolution of 2D nanopores is due to the existence of access resistance caused by the entrance of ions from bulk to the nanometer-sized pore This results in their sensing region to be longer than the geometric pore thickness To address this issue we are planning to implement one of the inherent characteristics of MXenes which is the intercalation of cations between their layers Previously electrochemical intercalation of cations in Ti3C2Tx thick-film electrodes from aqueous electrolytes and the resulting macroscopic electrode deformations contraction and expansion have been studied3 In situ Atomic Force Microscopy AFM and X-Ray Diffraction XRD techniques were used to monitor the deformation in Ti3C2Tx electrodes However the mechanism and kinetics of cation deintercalation are still poorly understood Because ion intercalation is expected to be accompanied by the transport of conjugated water molecules we expect Neutron Reflectivity NR to reveal new information about the role of water in the mechanism of the membranes spacing change upon cation deintercalation We will leverage NRs sensitivity to the isotopic differences between D2O and H2O to observe the changes in water content and surface group protonation inside the MXenes material Background and Preliminary Results We have developed a liquid-liquid interface approach to transfer delaminated Ti3C2Tx flakes onto a substrate in various scales microscale to macroscale Figure 1 shows SEM image and stitched AFM image using ImageJ4 of the wafer-scale transfer of stacked monolayer Ti3C2Tx flakes on the SiNx membrane We have used this method to transfer MXenes flakes onto a SiNx membrane with a pre-fabricated 100 nm hole to form free-standing Ti3C2Tx membranes Interestingly in these membranes we have observed the intercalation of cations from aqueous salt solution into the interlayer space of Ti3C2Tx membranes as shown in figure 2 In this figure the red trace is current as a function of time and black trace shows the relative nanopore thickness change over time measured solely from the change in conductance Figure 1 AFM image left and SEM image right of wafer-scale transfer of MXenes flakes on SiNx substrate Meni Wanunu Mehrnaz Mojtabavi Armin VahidMohammadi Majid Beidaghi According to the 100mV data in the first 10 seconds the conductance was 47nS at 04M KCl Then by doubling the voltage to 200mV the conductance initially doubled but then decreased which is believed to be due to the deintercalation of K ions and an increase of the MXenes membranes d-spacing Similar behavior was observed at higher voltages except that the rate of deintercalation increases Interestingly by decreasing the voltage to 100mV partial recovery in the conductance was observed which suggests the repopulation of cations between MXenes layers The reduction in conductance corresponds to a 20 increase in MXenes membrane thickness when ions are expelled from the sheets 06 nm increase in the 3nm initial film thickness And the increase in conductance after lowering the voltage to 100mV corresponds to 50 recovery of thickness In-situ AFM measurements upon applying a voltage across the Ti3C2Tx membrane further confirmed these thickness variations Ti3C2Tx flakes were transferred on the HOPG surface shown in Figure 2B One electrode was connected to the HOPG and the other one was immersed in buffer droplet 04M KCl on the HOPG surface Voltage was reversed several times to observe the effect on the thickness of the membrane Figure 2C shows that upon applying a negative voltage to the film the cations intercalate between MXenes layers resulting in contraction of membrane By reversing the voltage the cations deintercalate from the layers resulting in expansion of membrane thickness Neutron Reflectivity for Characterization As indicated our preliminary results have provided indirect evidence of cation deintercalation between Ti3C2Tx layers One of the concerns with the AFM measurements is that by applying a voltage to the surface the tip may experience a charge that would alter tip-surface interactions Moreover both AFM and XRD dont give any information about the mechanism and kinetics of different cations in this process NR data would provide depth-dependent evidence of water between individual MXenes layers These data can in principle be obtained from 10nm thin membranes which have not been characterized to date the results from this measurement would be used to design future experiments on the CANDoR reflectometer to probe the kinetics of intercalation The information that can be obtained from NR will provide valuable insights into this interesting feature of MXenes which will enable a better understanding of the design and incorporation of these materials in various fields such as nanopore biosensing Figure 2 A Example of current trace for a Ti3C2Tx nanopore with 6 nm diameter and 3 nm thickness using 400 mM KCl B AFM image of MXenes flakes on HOPG surface Cross points

in D2O due to the high Q values involved up to 05 -1 and 8 hours in H2O over a smaller Q range Each measurement will be performed in D2O and H2O solvents thus requiring 24 hours per measurement Preliminary data Static structure of Ti3C2OH2 Ti3C2OH2 flakes will be deposited on a silicon surface to optimize surface roughness The reflectivity from a single flake with 6 Ti3C2OH2 blue curve and Ti3C2OD2 orange curve layers in D2O solvent is shown in Figure 3 The penetration of water and HD exchange of the hydroxyl groups is clearly demonstrated by the presence of a peak at 03 -1 Preliminary data showing HD exchange are presented in Figure 4 The peak is about a factor of 3 smaller than predicted in Figure 3 and is rather broader 1 Study of static interlayer spacing change dependence on different cation types K Li Na We propose to determine the dependence of interlayer spacing change in Ti3C2Tx membranes on different cation types at equilibrium The preliminary data in Figure 4 show a small enhancement in the peak at Q values near 03  -1 in the presence of LiCl indicating swelling of the film However we do not have the required statistics to confirm this result and we wish to extend these measurements to Na ions 3 cations x 24 hourscation  72 hours 2 Electrochemically enhanced intercalation of cations Electrochemical driving forces can improve the depth of intercalation of cations into the thick Ti3C2Tx layers such as scattering neutrons as shown in Figure 4 potentially increasing the sample homogeneity Thus we wish to repeat the experiments in 1 on a sputtered gold substrate which will be used to drive intercalation using an external potentiostat 3 cations x 24 hourscation  72 hours Data will be reduced using the online Reductus tool and analyzed using Refl1D software We anticipate several follow-up measurements particularly kinetic measurements on the CANDoR reflectometer Requested Allocation on NGD-MAGIK 6 days References 1 Mojtabavi M VahidMohammadi A
