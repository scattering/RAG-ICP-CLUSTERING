Polymer dynamics in hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber nanocomposites Le Cai Anil Bhowmick and Ramanan Krishnamoorti University of Houston Scientific Background and Impact Hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber HNBR the chemical structure of which is shown in Figure 1a has been widely used in automobile and oil gas industries for insulation applications at high temperature and high pressure conditions Under these extreme conditions the maintenance of mechanical and thermal properties are important to prevent the failure of the elastomer In order to improve the mechanical properties such as toughness modulus and creep and thermal stability of the elastomer reinforcing nanoparticles such as graphene and carbon black CB as shown in Figure 1b are often added to HNBR to form nanocomposites Presence of nanoparticles in the HNBR polymer matrix leads to significant changes of polymer chain dynamics especially at the interface identified in Figure 1c which is closely related to the extent of reinforcement However the mechanism behind the changing dynamics as well as the correlation to the interaction between HNBR and the different nanoparticles remain unsolved Additionally it is still unclear which segment in HNBR would preferentially interact with nanoparticles and how it contributes to the changing dynamics Addressing these important questions is crucial for better control of the rubber performance that meets the industrial needs We specifically chose the nanocomposites of HNBR with different carbon blacks at varying concentrations as well as HNBR with unfunctionalized graphene to understand the nature of interactions and their consequences on the dynamics of the polymer and the properties of the nanocomposites To identify the specific nature of interaction and understand the dynamics quasielastic neutron scattering QENS is an excellent tool to examine the segmental dynamics of the polymer in the nanocomposite QENS provides the requisite spatial and temporal information of polymer motion based on the accessible momentum Q and frequency dependences from the double differential scattering function  Specifically QENS is able to measure the primary segmental relaxation time -process of polymer chains It has also been commonly used to study the local motion of a polymer matrix with a focus on nanoscale and microscopic segmental relaxations at nanosecond time scale We propose to use QENS to systematically quantify segmental dynamics and thereby understand the local motion of molecules in proximity to the nanoparticle By monitoring the distribution of relaxations as well as segmental diffusion coefficients as function of temperature the effect of different types of nanoparticles Figure 1b Top Schematic of Carbon black

butadiene rubber HNBR on 2D and 3D carbon black graphene and different loading level of CB as function both below and above glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer will be studies The mechanical and thermal properties of the composites can then be correlated with the dynamics of polymer matrix close to particles Research Objectives Lack of research on the segmental dynamics within the interfacial region of HNBR nanocomposites has left open questions on the physical interactions between CBGraphene and HNBR and their effect on final properties of the nanocomposites To be more specific the effect of structure and physicochemical properties of nanoparticles carbon blacks and graphene and loading level on the local segmental dynamics of the polymer at different temperatures is of interest and will be addressed in this proposed work While there is interest in understanding the effect of pressure on the dynamics we defer that work until we can fully understand the impact of temperature and nanoparticle on the dynamics In addition we will compare the interactions between nanoparticles and each polymer segment and identify the key element that contributes to changing dynamics We will examine the incoherent neutron scattering dominated by the protons using QENS to understand the local motion of hydrogen atoms in HNBR nanocomposites The mean-square displacement segment mobile fraction and relaxation rate of the polymer chains will be quantified We wish to understand the segmental motion of polymer chains within the interfacial region with varying concentrations of nanoparticles 3  The effect of different types of carbon black on local motion of proton within the interfacial region is observed to be independent in the case of non-polar rubber nanocomposites5  As for the nanoparticle-segment interaction our prediction is that the nonpolar part of HNBR saturated butadiene segment will interact preferentially with carbon black which needs to be verified Understanding such correlations would provide industrial solutions for tuning the final rubber properties Proposed Experiment Plan We will use hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber Zetpol HNBR 2010 Zeon Chemical LP with a weight-average Mw of 298105 gmol and a molecular weight distribution index MwMn of 38 having 36 weight fraction of the acrylonitrile ACN content  All samples will be prepared in aluminum holders with less than 01 mm thickness to minimize multiple scattering Different type of carbon black would be blended with HNBR The large particle size N990 moderate size N762 high structure nanoparticles N550 large surface area N220 N110 carbon black and unfunctionalized graphene will be selected to be mixed with HNBR Similar samples have been studied using differential scanning calorimetry thermos-gravimetric analysis as well as NMR spectroscopy Different loading of nanoparticles with concentration of nanoparticles of 0 10 20 and 40 will be studied We plan to use the High-Flux Backscattering Spectrometer HFBS NG2 The energy range of E 17 eV with 04 eV energy resolution full width at half maximum scattering vector Q of 012 to 178 -1 will be used To measure the Tg from temperature 10K to 330 K at a heating rate of 1 K per min We would collect the QENS profile of dynamic scattering function S Q 55 in range of scattering vector Q at five different temperatures from at glassy state and rubbery state of the samples We anticipate that the HFBS experiment would take 24 hsample and we have 11 samples HNBR HNBR with N990 N762 N550 N220 N110 and graphene at 20 concentration and HNBR with N550 and graphene at 10 and 40 also With the necessary Background scattering experiment and resolution experiments we anticipate a total of 12 days of beamtime Anticipated method of Data Analysis QENS data will be analyzed with inelastic neutron scattering fundamental function model 5F5F5D5D 55  5F5F5D5D 555E5E5D5D 55 1 In our case the coherent factors are negligible as the incoherent contribution would dominate the signal The mean-squared displacement 5b5b2 will be evaluated by applying the Debye-Waller approximation as the function of temperature 575757575757

motions In addition the diffusion constants will be analyzed using the Ficks law translational diffusion model If the diffusion is limited due the confinement the Chudley-Elloitt theory Hall-Ross jump diffusion model will be considered To further characterize the segmental dynamic process we will analyze the dynamic scattering laws SQ 55 obtaining from isothermal QENS test with few model functions
