Neutron Diffraction Studies on Zeolite Imidazolate Frameworks Encapsulating Stabilized Ultra-small Metal Clusters Metal-organic frameworks MOFs reveal high specific surface areas tunable pore sizes and organic linkers which are able to interact with guest ions Challenging goals in these systems are the selective formation and stabilization of very small metal clustersparticles inside their cavities Recently a widespread attention has been paid to the chemically very robust subclass of MOFs namely zeolite imidazolate frameworks ZIFs due to their large-scale industrial applications They are efficient sorbent materials that can be used for catalytic ion exchange and gas separation applications In particular the doping of ZIFs with metal clusters is of interest for heterogeneous catalysis and hydrogen storage Indeed the tailored functionalization of the coordination space of ZIFs offers unique perspectives that are beyond any other porous materials Recently preliminary SANS and USANS data on analogous systems was collected at the NCNR see Fig1 for two types of microporous alumino-silicate zeolites doped with Ag ions We have also got approved SANSUSANS proposals for elucidating a set of pure synthetic zeolites doped with Ag Au and Cu ions In contrast the currently proposed ZIFs are being metal organic frameworks made from zinc ions coordinated by four imidazolate rings in the same way as Si and Al atoms are covalently joined by bridging oxygens in zeolites Fig 1 right Figure 1 Preliminary SANSUSANS data for a system of zeolites synthesized in our group left and middle and the chemical structure of the ZIFs as a metal organic framework made by zinc ions coordinated by four imidazolate rings in the same way as Si and Al atoms are covalently joined by bridging oxygens in zeolites The sphere represents the pore size within the framework which can be used for entrapping the proposed ultra-small metal clusters right Indeed this encouraged us to propose such type of nanoporous materials ZIFs for performing neutron diffraction ND experiments in order to study the structural peculiarities of stabilized Au Ag Pd and Pt clusters 1nm inside the functionalized ZIFs cavities We are planning to incorporate specially tailored deuterated ligands for clusters stabilization over a wide range of metal loading This would help us to investigate parameters paramount to kinetic and catalytic mechanism for metal-loaded ZIFs M-ZIFs Besides the proposed neutron diffraction along with SANSUSANS experiments would help us to determine the atomicity of metal clusters after they are encapsulated in ZIFs cavities and the size effects of such ultra-small metal clusters Further it can complement our ongoing investigations and endeavors to elucidate hydrogen spillover effects in the adsorption process Neutron diffraction studies are essential for the current study and can complement the XRD data Indeed upon applying neutron diffraction there is a significant difference between the neutron scattering lengths for the atomic species constituting the functionalized MZIF complex structure where M stands for Au Ag Pd or Pt Besides utilizing the monochromator Ge311 would provide improving resolution at lower angles and increased sensitivity of the BT-1 facility for the current MZIF studies With maximizing the number of observations through the use of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ND measurements the complex structure of the proposed systems can be efficiently determined This would bring considerable structural insights to these interesting systems for viable applications A combination of XRD ND and SANSUSANS for elucidating the structural peculiarities of the proposed synthetic MZIF is essential as the penetrating power of neutrons is important to provide representative averages of the metal clusters sizes and sites distributions average occupancies bond lengths and angles The ND measurements would also enable us to explore one of the densest and lowest energy of the crystalline ZIFs phases evolving from the amorphous phase under certain physical conditions Besides molecular dynamics will be applied for constructing a model for interpreting the obtained data We believe the sensitivity of the neutron powder profile to the scattering by the adsorbed very small metal clusters will help us to draw conclusions on their whereabouts and gives insight on the local ordering scheme packing regime and their atomicity with the help of refinement with realistic constrains Further it will help us to distinguish the packing regime for the encapsulated metal clusters in ZIF cages Indeed such rich structural information that can be obtained through ND would much help us to reliably interpret the plasmonic and photocatalytic properties of such compounds thus allowing for their rational design for viable applications The ND method would enable us to achieve such goals due to its inherent capability in refining atomic sites coordinate parameters and extracting the structure factors that are necessary to describe the precise structure of such ZIF-metallic complex We are proposing to use a combination of ND SANS USANS to fully resolve the structural peculiarities of the functionalized MZIFs We shall investigate the ZIFs functionalized with stabilized Ag Au Pd and Pt clusters amounting to a total of fourteen samples over a range of metal loading 5-30 wt for each type of clusters and under different physical conditions are suggested for the current study As an average measurement time 9 hrs is required for a high statistics run the required beamtime would be about 5 days Relevant Literature 1 Cui X Li W Ryabchuk P et al Bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis by
