Rotational Dynamics of the Organic Cation in a Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskite Introduction Three-dimensional 3D hybrid halide perovskites have achieved great success in the field of photovoltaics due to their superior photovoltaic properties such as the tunable band gap 1 low recombination rates 3 and their low-cost manufacture  However the three-dimensional hybrid perovskites also face a severe challenge device degrading and performance regression when exposed to the oxygen and moisture Therefore many researchers have begun to focus on the two-dimensional 2D layered organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites which exhibit attractive optoelectronic properties and high device stability 6 On the other hand unlike the 3D case it has long been disputed as to whether the rotational dynamics of the organic cation affects the optoelectronic properties of the 2D hybrid halide perovskites Thus studies of the rotational motion of different organic cations could give us a better understanding of the intrinsic relationship between the device optoelectronic properties and organic cation dynamics Proposed Research In the proposed research we would like to investigate the rotational dynamics of the organic cation in a new two-dimensional metal halide perovskite mPEA2PbI4 mPEACH3C6H5CH2CH2NH3 cation shown in Fig 1A We have performed quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS measurements on the phenylethyl-ammonium lead iodide PEA2PbI4 PEAC6H5CH2CH2NH3 cation shown in Fig 1B and octyl-ammonium lead iodide OA2PbI4 OACH3CH27NH3 cation shown in Fig 1C to study the rotational dynamics of their organic cations As shown in Figure 2 and 3 the OA cation exhibits different rotational behaviors at different phases in the low-temperature phase and intermediate temperature phase only three-fold rotations of the NH3 and CH3 group exist Fig 3C while in the high temperature phase  T  310 K the OA cation exhibits a combination of a two-fold rotation of the NH3-CH2 group around the crystallographic c-axis three-fold rotations of the NH3 and CH3 group and slow librations of the rest CH2 groups Figure 1 Configuration of the organic cations A mPEA B PEA C OA intermediate temperature phase 240 K  T  310 K On the other hand as shown in Figure 4 and 5 in the single phase of PEA2PbI4 below 470 K only three-fold rotation of the NH3 group exists According to our QENS data the PEA2PbI4 exhibits extra rotational mode when it enters the high-temperature phase T  470 K which we are investigating recently In order to make a good comparison with the OA2PbI4 and PEA2PbI4 cases we would like to perform quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements on the mPEA2PbI4 sample at 20 different temperatures from base temperature up to 500 K using the Disk Chopper Spectrometer DCS at NCNR with high Q and E resolutions Based on our previous experience  4 hours are needed for each temperature We estimate the measurements will take at least 4 days taking the Figure 5 Visualization of the rotational behavior of PEA cation Figure 4 Quasi-elastic neutron scattering data and fitting of PEA2PbI4 Figure 2 Quasi-elastic neutron scattering data and fitting of OA2PbI4 Figure 3 Visualization of the rotational behavior of OA cation sample loading and temperature changing into account References  M R Filip et al Steric engineering of metal-halide perovskites with tunable optical band gaps Nature Communications 1315 5757 2014  S D Stranks et al Metal-halide perovskites for photovoltaic and light-emitting devices Nature Nanotechnology 10 391 2017  L M Herz Charge-carrier mobilities in metal halide perovskites fundamental mechanisms and limits ACS Energy Lett 2 1539-1548 2017  T Chen et al Origin of long lifetime of band-edge charge carriers in organic-inorganic lead iodide perovskites PNAS 114 7519-7524 2017  M A Green et al The emergence of perovskite solar cells Nat Photonics 87 506-514 2014  H Tsai et al High-efficiency two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite solar cells Nature 536 312-316 2016  J Yin et al Excitonic and polaronic properties of 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites ACS Energy Letters 2 417-423 2017
