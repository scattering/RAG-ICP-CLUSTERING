Proposal Understanding the Role of Encapsulant Polymer Structures in Potential Induced Degradation of Solar Panels Collaborators Stephanie L Moffitt and Xiaohong Gu NIST Materials and Structural Systems Division Jamie L Weaver NIST Chemical Sciences Division Potential induced degradation PID is a serious threat to the performance of todays solar panels Solar panels in large arrays operate at high voltages In these high voltage panels a negative bias across the panel pulls sodium ions Na from the top glass-layer of the panel through the encapsulant to the photovoltaic cell interface Fig1a1 The presence of Na at the photovoltaic region of the solar panels is linked to multiple degradation and failure modes which cause substantial power loss or even total panel failure2 These failure modes are referred to as PID Fig 1b Work has begun to develop polymer encapsulants which limit PID by limiting the migration of Na within solar panels However there is not a clear understanding of how the structure and chemistry of encapsulants limit or facilitate the movement of Na The quantitative relationship between the ion migration rate and the encapsulant structurechemistry under high voltage has never been studied through the lifetime of a solar panel Years of exposure to outdoor temperatures weather and sunlight can degrade polymer encapsulants Thus polymer encapsulants need to be understood in the pristine state and after aging This work will connect the study of a solar panel polymer encapsulant with a study of PID in solar panels Ultra small angle neutron scattering USANS will be combined with cross-sectional standards-based energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS to 1 Quantify rates of Na migration in encapsulant polymers 2 Investigate the influence of polymer structure of both pristine and aged polymer encapsulants on the ability to limit Na migration and 3 Study the effect of Na migration upon the structure of polymer encapsulates The dissemination of information gained from this study will guide the solar industry in the development of next generation encapsulants that limit Na migration thus limiting PID and extending the performance life of solar panels Fig1 a Cross-section illustration of the layers that make up a solar panel The red arrow shows the direction of voltage potential of a negatively biased

with water to promote corrosion of the metal regions4 red regions around the black metallization PID testing is performed by applying a voltage bias across a solar panel while the panel is held in the damp heat condition 85 relative humidity 85C In this work PID testing will be modeled after commercial testing 1000 V will be applied across sandwich sample structures Fig 2b while the sample are held at 85 relative humidity and 85C the damp heat condition Samples will be pulled after 48 hours half the commercial testing time 96 hours and 138 hours After testing half of the samples will be made into cross sections for chemical analysis to study and quantify the Na content The other half of the samples will be used for USANS measurements to help understand how the Na migrates USANS is a powerful technique for studying the nm-scale packing structure of the crystalline and amorphous regions of polymer encapsulants It is reasonable to hypothesis that Na ions may travel more easily through the amorphous regions of a polymer rather than through the crystalline region Thus we anticipate that having a strong understanding of the crystallineamorphous packing structure within polymer encapsulants throughout their service will be crucial to understanding PID This study will focus on understanding the structure of ethylene vinyl acetate EVA the encapsulant which is used in almost all current solar panels The structured will be studied in the initial as-made state after PID testing and after accelerated aging Previous work has shown that EVA increases crystallinity from 36-40 after aging and that evidence of this structural change is seen in the Q-range of 004 -1 Fig2a5 thus the migration of Na through the EVA may change throughout the lifetime of the polymer as the encapsulant ages and its structure changes The pairing of PID studies with USANS will increase the understanding of how the structure of EVA influences Na migration rates throughout the service life of solar panels Fig 2 a Small angle X-ray scattering of EVA after exposure to 0-2000 hours of the damp heat DH testing condition 85 relative humidity 85C Adapted from Yuen et al5 b Schematic of proposed glasspolymer sample structure The first phase of samples will be sandwich structures made of top and bottom glass or silica pieces with EVA laminated in the middle Fig 2b These samples will be subjected to PID testing for different lengths of time 48 96 and 138h Four of the samples will have Na-containing glass and 4 of the samples will have silica no Na In addition 3 blank samples glass without EVA silica without EVA and EVA by itself will be measured to enable background subtraction The ability for neutrons to measure samples laminated to 3mm-thick glass is an advantage over X-ray techniques Keeping samples fully laminated will remove the risk of causing structural damage while delaminating the samples after PID testing Comparing the structures with various Na content induced by various PID exposure times will provide evidence of whether Na induces changes in the polymer structure Furthermore if there is significant heterogeneous accumulation for instance if the Na collects only in the amorphous regions of the polymer this may be detectable The second phase of samples will be sandwich structures which have undergone PV polymer aging processes The Polymers group at the NIST Materials and Structural Systems Division has developed testing methods where application of heat humidity and UV light can induce degradation in polymer encapsulants to imitate mid-late life materials Three aging conditions will be investigated damp heat DH UV exposure and DH combined with UV exposure Each condition will be applied for 1250 hours Both damp heat and UV exposure have been shown to induce structural changes in EVA within 1250 hours56 USANS measurements will reveal how the structure of aged polymers changes with respect to pristine polymers These aged polymer samples will also be subjected to various levels of PID testing Comparison of the 1st and 2nd set of structures will provide information about how polymer encapsulant structure is involved in PID throughout the decades-long lifetime of a solar panel We anticipate that in phase 1 there will be 11 measurements 8 samples 0 48 96 and 138h of PID for glass and for silica and 3 blanks glass silica and EVA At 2 hours per sample 22h and adding 2 hours for setup we will need 1 day for phase 1 In phase 2 we anticipate that there will be 14 measurements 12 samples DH UV DHUV each exposed to 0 48 96 and 138h of PID and 2 blanks glass and EVA At 2 hours per sample 28h and adding 2 hours for setup we will need 125 day for phase 1 Therefor we would like to request 225 days total separated into 2 sessions The sessions should be spaced apart by 60 days or more to enable time for aging and PID testing Phase 1 samples will be ready by the end of March 2020 Data is anticipated to be analyzed with Igor software and NCNRs software packages Requested Q-range is 00003 - 01 nm-1 We would like to look the long period-spacing at 004 -1 and structures at longer length scales We note that reflectometry studies to study the glassencapsulant interface are also being pursued but are out of scope for the current proposal References 1 Pingel S et al Potential induced degredation of solar cells and panels
