 Page 1 of 3 Probing the dynamic heterogeneity in conjugated polymers Scientific Importance Unique electronic properties and intrinsic mechanical flexibility of conjugated polymers CPs are keys for their potential applications in a broad range of devices ranging from photovoltaics OPVs1 and field-effect transistors OFETs2 to emerging technologies such as thermal electrics electronic skin34 stretchable electronics56 and photodetectors7 Furthermore ease of tuning their molecular parameters has expanded their ranges of applications89 Thermomechanical and optoelectrical properties of CPs are greatly influenced by their microstructures and chain dynamics1011 The dynamics of the conjugated polymers which control the optoelectrical properties of the polymers have not been well investigated11 Its challenging to directly measure the backbone dynamics of CPs CPs are chemically heterogeneous comb-like-polymers having a rigid-rod like backbone with long soft flexible sidechain Fig 1 Backbone of CPs is expected to have much slower dynamics compared to long flexible alkyl sidechain Some dynamic characterization techniques eg dynamical mechanical analysis DMA dielectric spectroscopy or differential scanning calorimetry DSC have been used to investigate the dynamics of these polymers101213 Those techniques provide the global chain dynamics that has the contributions from both sidechains and backbones Furthermore there is a lack of investigations of dynamics in CPs to distinguish the motions of backbones from the side chains Understanding of dynamics of individual components in CPs is important for their device applications This proposal is aimed to decouple the backbone and sidechain dynamics in CPs by the combination of neutron scattering and protondeuterium labelling The selective deuteration of CPs side chains or backbone allows to isolate the contribution of backbone and sidechain from one another Furthermore spacetime resolution of neutron scattering techniques especially the quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS is high enough to capture the nano to picosecond dynamics taking place in CPs14 This proposal would provide the understanding of the effect of molecular structure on the backbone dynamics and correlate the role of the chain dynamics in the mechanical optical and electronic properties of the conjugated polymers Preliminary Work Recently Gomez et al revealed that thiophene backbone motion of polythiophenes is enhanced as the side chain length increases from hexyl to dodecyl using quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS10 However as previously discussed this work suffers from the difficulty in decoupling the backbone and sidechain contributions from QENS measurements using the protonated sample Pozzo et al also measured backbone motions of poly3-hexylthiophene P3HT with QENS measurements by the deuteration of the side chains15 The substitution of all the side chain hydrogens of P3HT with deuterium significantly reduced the side-chain contributions to the incoherent cross section from 93 to 2515 They found that the liberational motion of the P3HT backbone occurs at a much higher temperature then side chains Fig Fig 1 a chemical structure of iso-indigo IID polymer b MD simulation of the structure Fig 2 Mean squared displacement of fully hydrogenated and partially deuterated side chain P3HT15 Page 2 of 3 2 This work has fully demonstrated the feasibility of the combination of neutron scattering and isotopic labeling to isolate the motions of backbones from the side-chains of CPs We have synthesized polythiophenes with deuterated sidechains from pentyl to decyl Fig 3 1 gram for each We performed the laboratory-based characterization technique DMA to understand the dynamics of a series of polythiophenes as shown Fig 3 We observed that by systematically varying the side-chain length the glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer backbone could be controlled between -10 to 57 oC The variation in Tg suggests that the polymer backbone mobility changes with side-chain length Apart from P3AT polymer we are also in the process of synthesizing the diketopyrrolopyrrole DPP variant with deuterated sidechains with controlled deuteration along the sidechain using the deuteration facility available in CNMS Those D-A polymers possess superior electronic property than P3ATs and would be next target in our study Choice of Instrument This proposal aims to understand impact of molecular structure on the backbone and side chain dynamics in CPs through selective deuteration of either sidechain or backbone We plan to use the High-Flux Backscattering Spectrometer HFBS to explore the dynamics of the polymers sidechains and backbone HFBS has a fine energy resolution of 35 eV and provides a dynamics energy to capture the nano to picosecond dynamics of polymers Segmental motion as well the polymer side chain dynamics will be within the timescale of the HFBS instrument Since the length of the polymer sidechain is within the Q momentum transfer coverage of the HFBS we expect to fully resolve the dynamics backbone segmental and side chain of the polymers in varied conditions A separate proposal will be submitted to study polymers chain dynamics using Neutron Spin Echo NSE spectrometer to compliment this work From these studies we could understand the heterogeneous chain dynamics phenomenon in CPs The results of this study will enable us to design new polymers that will not only have excellent electronic property but also have robust mechanical properties and long-term device stability Experiment Plan All samples will be melt processed in aluminum foil pouches shaped cylindrically to fit along the inside wall of the standard annular aluminum sample canisters The polymer will be melted and spread evenly across the unfolded pouch to form films between 01 -02 mm thick At first we plan to perform the elastic scans between 20 K and 523 K to understand the onset of both the main and side chain dynamics as a function of temperature Dynamics measurements will be carried out at temperatures below Tg 250K close to Tg 300K and higher then Tm 473523K for different polymers We will have 6 samples side chain deuterated and protonated P3HT P3OT P3DT in total Sample specific resolution will also be measured at 20 K To run those samples together with resolution 1 day and background 1 day we request 10 days of beam time to complete this set of the experiment at HFBS spectrometer Time for elastic scans 6 samples x 85 hourstemp  2 days Time for quasi-elastic measurements 6 samples x 3 temperatures x 8 hourstemp  144 hours  6 days The QENS data analysis will be performed in close collaboration with the QENS instrument team We are also planning to study the dynamics processes in these polymers by calculating the dynamics structure factor SqtSq0 from molecular dynamics simulations Calculated dynamics structure factor which depending on q reflects the diffusion of the entire polymer molecule and internal motions can be directly correlated with the measured QENS spectra This approach will allow us to model the experimental data and extract the dynamics related parameters of both the backbone and side chain of Fig 3 a Chemical structure of interested polythiophenes and b DMA results for polythiophenes Page 3 of 3 those CPs QENS results will be correlated to the thin film mechanical and electrical results measured at PIs home institution Safety Considerations The materials that will be used in these experiments are stable and chemically non-hazardous Samples will be loaded into aluminum foil pouches used for HFBS and sealed with In wire Response to Previous Panel This is the first-time submission
