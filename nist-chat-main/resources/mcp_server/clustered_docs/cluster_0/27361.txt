 1 Polysorbate-20 segmental dynamics Effects of cosurfactant and the ferrocene redox couple Scientific Background and Aims of Proposed Experiments A grand challenge needed for 21st century power systems is fast utility-scale and energy-dense storage for more efficient and cheaper use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar We are studying microemulsion systems as novel electrolytes for large scale energy storage through a recently funded DOE Energy Frontiers Research Center project entitled Breakthrough Electrolytes for Energy Storage1 Microemulsions MEs are thermodynamically stable isotropic nanoscale dispersions of two immiscible liquids such as oil and water stabilized by a surfactant and cosurfactant MEs are an interesting class of electrolytes because they possess several properties that make them useful as an energy storage medium - they are thermodynamically stable have fast dynamics possess large interfacial areas and can solubilize large concentrations of hydrophobic redox-active compounds in an aqueous electrolyte solution2 The structures of the microemulsion nanophases are tunable through controlling the composition temperature and salinity Additionally the cosurfactant chemistry and loading directly affects the interfacial fluidity and rigidity as demonstrated by our preliminary SANS data Fig 1 The 60 and 90 water samples that we propose to study are bicontinuous ow-MEs respectively according to our preliminary SANS data not shown Previous electrochemical results show that the microemulsion systems to be studied are reversible up to a very fast scan rate 22 Vs Fig 2 This fast charge transfer is not easily explained but insight into the local dynamics of the surfactants head group will provide a foundation to understand the proximity and transfer of ions across the oilwater interface Fig 3 One possible mechanism is that the ferrocenium ion must cross the oilwater interface as it is not miscible in toluene In this picture the charge carried on the surfactants ethylene oxide head groups and the salt together balance the charge of Figure 1 the SANS results of micelles with and without butanol bulk contrast demonstrating butanol decreases the quasiperiodic repeat distance via a shirt of the scattering curve to higher Q Figure 2 Cyclic voltammetry of a microemulsion exhibiting reversible behavior up to 22 Vs 2 the ferrocenium We believe ferrocenium must remain near the surfactant head groups because ferrocene is insoluble in water Alternatively the nitrate anion may migrate into the oil phase to balance the charge of the ferrocenium However nitrate is poorly soluble in toluene and the only stabilizing effect would be from the ferrocenium We therefore suspect that the first hypothesis is the most probable Moreover the crossing of ferrocenium over the oil-water interface will cause an observable change in the local dynamics of the surfactants head group3 This experiment will give us a fundamental understanding into what is happening on a molecular level during the electrochemical reactions that has not been verified experimentally Experiment Plan We propose to investigate the fast local dynamics of polysorbate-20 surfactant molecules 10-9-- 10-12 seconds in a micelle or microemulsion and monitor the change in its local dynamics in the presence of a cosurfactant and the oxidation of ferrocene to ferrocenium Quasi-elastic neutron scattering is one of the best techniques to observe such motions in the length and time scale of a microemulsion wateroil interface and specifically the disc chopper spectrometer at NIST has the needed energy resolution of E 50 eV and time scales of 02 ps to 20 ps We propose to analyze 24 samples that systematically build up the microemulsions so that we may understand the impact of each components on the local dynamics Only the polysorbate-20 PS20 will be protonated - the ferrocene Fc ferrocenium Fc butanol and toluene will be deuterated All samples will also have potassium nitrate as supporting electrolyte We estimate that each sample will take about 6 hours to run so with our proposed 24 samples and one sample of vanadium for instrument resolution this comes to 150 hours 625 days and considering time required for temperature equilibration and sample changes we request a total of 7 days of beam time Proposed Sample List Micelles without cosurfactant 1 90 D2O 10 PS20 2 90 D2O 10 PS20 Fc 3 90 D2O 10 PS20 Fc 4 60 D2O 40 PS20 5 60 D2O 40 PS20 Fc 6 60 D2O 40 PS20 Fc Micelles with the cosurfactant 7 90 D2O 10 PS20butanol 8 90 D2O 10 PS20butanol Fc 9 90 D2O 10 PS20butanol Fc 10 60 D2O 40 PS20butanol 11 60 D2O 40 PS20butanol Fc 12 60 D2O 40 PS20  butanol Fc Figure 3 an illustration of the polysorbate-20 molecule and the movement of the ferrocenium ion 3 Microemulsions without cosurfactant 13 90 D2O 9 PS20 1 toluene 14 90 D2O 9 PS20 1 toluene w Fc 15 90 D2O 9 PS20 1 toluene w Fc 16 58 D2O 39 PS20 4 toluene 17 58 D2O 39 PS20 4 toluene w Fc 18 58 D2O 39 PS20 4 toluene wFc Microemulsions with cosurfactant 19 90 D2O 9 PS20butanol 1 toluene 20 90 D2O 9 PS20butanol 1 tolueneFc 21 90 D2O 9 PS20butanol 1 tolueneFc 22 58 D2O 39 PS20butanol 4 toluene 23 58 D2O 39 PS20butanol 4 tolueneFc 24 58 D2O 39 PS20butanol 4 tolueneFc References 1 Breakthrough Electrolytes for Energy Storage BEES Available at httpsscienceostigovbesefrcCentersBEES 2 Schwuger M J Stickdorn K  Schomcker R Microemulsions in Technical Processes Chem Rev 95 849-864 1995 3 Sharma V K et al Nanoscopic dynamics of bicontinous microemulsions Effect of membrane associated protein Soft Matter 13 4871-4880 2017
