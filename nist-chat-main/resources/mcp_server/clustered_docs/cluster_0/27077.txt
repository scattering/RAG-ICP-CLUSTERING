1 Investigating thermodynamic behavior in polymer blend electrolytes for lithium batteries through small angle neutron scattering Kevin W Gao and Nitash P Balsara Background Solid polymer electrolytes SPEs are of great interest for developing safer lithium batteries as they are less flammable than traditional organic liquid electrolytes1 They may also enable the development of higher energy density batteries with lithium metal anodes2 The field of SPEs began in 1973 with the discovery that polyethylene oxide PEO forms ion conducting complexes with alkali metal ions3 Since then PEO-based electrolytes have been extensively studied due to their excellent solubility for lithium salts Our group has characterized the ion transport properties of PEO with lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide LiTFSI salt in numerous studies as well as that of PEO-containing composites such as block copolymers wherein two chemically distinct homopolymers are combined by a covalent bond Chemically distinct homopolymers can also be combined through physical mixture in a polymer blend The advantages of blending polymers for an electrolyte include ease of preparation and close control of physical properties through compositional changes One reason for blending PEO with another polymer is to obtain improved properties such as a higher ionic conductivity In order for this to happen it is important for the polymer blend to be miscible as each phase in an immiscible blend will have the same properties as they would individually Unfortunately most polymer blends phase separate because the entropy gain of mixing is negligibly small compared to the typically endothermic enthalpy of mixing We have prepared SPEs by blending PEO and another polyether compound polydiethylene oxide-alt-oxymethylene P2EO-MO with LiTFSI salt P2EO-MOLiTFSI exhibits a lower ionic conductivity when compared with PEOLiTFSI electrolytes but have a higher steady-state cationic transference number4 The drop in conductivity was attributed to an increase in the glass transition temperature while the higher transference number was thought to be due to an increase in solvation site density4 We hypothesize that a miscible blend of PEO and P2EO-MO with LiTFSI can have both high conductivity and high transference number as the glass transition temperature and solvation site density may be altered favorably A similar analog can be found in todays highly commercially successful lithium ion batteries which use a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate Ethylene carbonate alone with its high dielectric constant has good salt solubility but poor ion mobility Dimethyl carbonate with its low dielectric constant is good for ion transport but has poor salt solubility It is the combination of the two which forms the optimal electrolyte for battery performance In the current study we wish to investigate the phase behavior of lithium salt containing polymer blends made up of a combination of PEO and a polyether compound such as P2EO-MO These blend electrolytes will contain LiTFSI salt of varying salt concentration r where we define r as the molar ratio of LiTFSI to oxygen atoms We will map out a phase diagram by calculating the Flory-Huggins interaction parameters  via small angle neutron scattering SANS experiments The miscibility of these polymer systems as a function of r temperature polymer chemical structure and composition will be determined Finally we will relate phase behavior to electrochemical properties Previous Work Tsuchida and coworkers showed that blending PEO and polymethacrylic acid improved both conductivity and mechanical flexibility5 Similarly Rocco and colleagues prepared a PEO-based electrolyte blend with polybisphenol-A-co-epichlorohydrin and lithium perchlorate salt6 The miscibility of this blend was 2 attributed to hydrogen bonds between the polymers More recently Xie and Lodge investigated the phase behavior of binary polymer blends containing low molecular weight polyethylene-alt-propylene and PEO with lithium salts7 They found that the miscibility of the system decreased with the addition of salt and showed that the phase behavior depended on salt concentration and composition of the blend Several methods are typically used to demonstrate miscibility in a polymer blend The simplest method is the eye test Immiscible blends typically form macro-phase separated domains with grain sizes larger than the optical length scale8 Thus immiscible blends appear opaque and cloudy due to the scattering of the light When we add LiTFSI to 5050 PEO and P2EO-MO blends they appear transparent at 90 C suggesting miscibility However even an immiscible blend may appear transparent if the refractive indices of the polymer components are similar enough The most commonly used method to determine miscibility is the measurement of the glass transition temperature via differential scanning calorimetry DSC analysis The existence of a single glass transition is generally considered to indicate miscibility8 While limitations from the sensitivity of the instrument and possible overlap of multiple glass transition features exist DSC provides a fast way to provide evidence for miscibility Representative DSC curves for an immiscible blend r  004 showing two glass transition temperatures and a miscible blend r  010 showing a single glass transition temperature are shown in Figure 1 While the aforementioned methods are generally accepted to show the miscibility of a polymer blend system it is important to discuss the thermodynamics of such a system The basic definition of a miscible blend one that is homogeneous down to the molecular level is that the Gibbs free energy of mixing is negative Using Flory-Huggins theory9-10 555Z5Z5X5X5555 5G5G551ln5515c5c15A5A1552ln5525c5c25A5A2555515525c5c 1 where Gm is the free energy of mixing per unit volume kB is Boltzmanns constant T is the absolute temperature i vi Ni are volume fractions volumes per monomeric unit and degree of polymerizations and v is an arbitrary reference volume For a symmetric polymer system to be miscible the following must also hold8 55 1215A5A115A5A222 N is usually large for a polymer so it is easy to see why most polymers will not mix as this requires very small values for  Our group has shown that salt addition can greatly affect the value of 11 Salt could induce positive interactions between two polymers giving rise to a negative Gibbs energy of mixing We plan to show miscibility by determining the  values in our polymer blends To do this we will use the same framework utilized by Balsara and coworkers in 1992 when they analyzed the thermodynamic interactions in polyolefin blends12 In that study they developed a phase diagram using  parameters extracted from SANS experiments Deuterated polymers provided contrast for neutron scattering Figure 1 DSC showing one glass transition temperature for a 5050 PEOP2EO-MO blend of r  010 and two glass transition temperatures at r  004 Arrows point to the features exhibiting a glass transition 3 Proposed Work Our goal in this study is to measure the  parameters of our polymer blend electrolytes at various temperatures to map out a phase diagram for these systems We would like to demonstrate the miscibility of a blend containing PEO and a similar polyether analog The effects of salt addition polyether chemical structure polyether molecular weight and composition on the polymer blends phase behavior will be investigated We will then correlate phase behavior with the electrochemical properties in these systems Our collaborators in the Coates Group at Cornell have synthesized P2EO-MO polyethers of molecular weight 26 kg mol-1 and 16 kg mol-1 and polyethylene oxide-alt-dimethylene oxide PEO-2MO with a molecular weight of 26 kg mol-1 These molecular weights are all above the entanglement molecular weight We mix these polyethers with deuterated PEO of molecular weight 35 kg mol-1 to provide contrast for neutron scattering experiments The polyethers in the proposed study are shown in Figure 2 Three salt concentrations neat r  004 and r  010 and three compositions 5050 3565 and 2080 will be examined Measurements will be done at temperatures  70 C where the polymers are in a melt state Specifically we want to perform SANS experiments at 70 80 90 100 and 110 C within a Q range between 0003 to 05  -1 for the following 27 samples shown in Table 1 We have airtight aluminum holders for all of these samples The SANS data will be reduced using Igor and analyzed using the general framework of the random-phase approximation to extract  parameters12-13 We tentatively request 3 days of beamtime on either the NGB 30m SANS or NG7 30m SANS instruments to complete these experiments Our group has prior experience using a variety of NCNR beamlines and recently successfully measured the radius of gyration in PEOLiTFSI electrolytes using SANS at NIST14 References 1 Tarascon J M Armand M Nature 2001 414 6861 359-367 2 Armand M Solid State Ionics 1983 9-10 745-754 3 Fenton D E Parker J
