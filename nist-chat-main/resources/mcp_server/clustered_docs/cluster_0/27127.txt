Quasielastic neutron scattering study of molecular dynamics of a renewable 3D-printing material Scientific Importance Lignin is a byproduct from bio-refineries and is one of the most abundant renewable materials on earth However its uses are limited by its heterogeneous highly branched structure and low molecular weight1 In this study the rigidity of hyper-branched phenolic lignin was modified with flexible semi-crystalline polyethylene oxide PEO chains revealing unique characteristics for 3D-printing shape-programming and self-healing as well as stress-strain sensing applications The key to this material design is controlling inter- and intra-molecular interactions and molecular relaxation of both amorphous and crystalline phases via the formation of multiple electron donor-acceptor complexes Unlike traditional processing techniques such as compression molding in fused deposition modeling FDM or 3D-printing the material is heated to melt then extruded through a printing nozzle at a high shear rate Since 3D objects are created via layer-by-layer deposition2 3 the mechanical characteristics of the 3D-printed objects strongly depend on adhesion between the layers We reported that high molecular mobility molecular interfusion and melt-diffusion between the two printed layers enhance adhesion and weld energy Figure 1a4 Similar studies were also revealed recently5-7 The most common techniques used to quantitatively determine the 3D-printing and self-healing characteristics of materials are rheology thermal analysis and optical and electron microscopy in which the bulk properties and long range molecular relaxation of the materials are dominant34 6 8 However the detailed molecular characteristics of both lignin and PEO at the nano-scale with local relaxation characteristics for 3D-printing and self-healing applications are still ambiguous This proposal aims to tackle that ambiguity by investigating the local molecular dynamics of this 3D-printing material Lignin has a rigid structure with a preponderance of phenolic groups9 PEO has flexible linear chains containing a high density of hydroxyl -OH groups that promote molecular mobility and coupling by forming hydrogen bonds and inducing interlayer diffusion The long-range molecular relaxation commonly comes from polymer backbones occurring at thermal transition or phase changes such as glass transition and melting temperatures In the glassy state the local molecular motion and degree of freedom of short polymer chains containing -OH groups is critical to form the hydrogen bonding thus improving the adhesion between the 3D-printed layers The outstanding question to be investigated in this proposal is What is the effect of long-range molecular relaxation and morphological properties on the local molecular dynamics of a multi-functional self-healing and 3D-printable material The backscattering spectrometer has been used extensively to investigate segmental dynamics and diffusion of polymer chains in various systems such as highly-branched and confined structures10-12 In our study both lignin and PEO chains have a high hydrogen content with high incoherent neutron scattering length density 20 x 10-62 that allows studying overall averaged local dynamics of PEO modified- lignin crosslinked chains at different structural states during the relaxation process Figure 1 a An example of a self-healing 3D-printed object made from a modified lignin with polyethylene oxide PEO b Storage modulus and phase angle as a function of time during a

after cooling to RT for 1h 4h and 1 day Preliminary Work We have characterized the rheological and structural relaxation of the composite in the bulk Our data reveals that the presence of PEO chains induces very long rheological relaxation times Figure 1b After melting the PEO-modified lignin composite the sample was cooled to room temperature RT and the rheological response was measured The measured shear storage modulus orange and phase angle green indicate no relaxation of the polymer chains after more than 2 hours at RT Excellent temperature dependent tunable relaxation behavior of polymeric chains results in a wide window of elasticity and molecular mobility not shown here In situ small angle neutron scattering SANS was used to measure the structural relaxation Data shown in Figure 1c and 1d for ca 15 mm thick films indicate that structures form within the PEO-modified lignin at RT black curve These structures are removed upon heating the sample in situ to 70 C orange curve However by cooling the material to RT and relaxing for different time periods the structural recovery is revealed Note that these rheological thermal and morphological properties were all examined with polymer backbone dynamics during the phase changes corresponding to different morphological characteristics At 70 C a homogenous 3-dimensional 3D network structure formation Figure 1d was observed However at RT a nano phase spherical structure is nucleated and developed Local motion of the networked structure containing both lignin and PEO chains at different morphological formations has not been discovered yet With an aim to study the local dynamics of the average structure constructed by PEO-lignin crosslinks at different long-range relaxation states recently we conducted an elastic scan of PEO-modified lignin composite having 50 wt hardwood lignin in HFBS The spectrum presented in Figure 2 is complex with multiple transitions that might correspond to different phase transitions or segmental movements of different components of this composite In order to resolve this complexity we need to measure pure PEO pure lignin and other composites at different compositions The overall purpose in this study is not to separate the contribution of PEO or lignin to the local motion of this 3D-network We are interested in the local dynamics of the average structure constructed by PEO-lignin crosslinks at different long-range relaxation states for 3D-printing and self-healing applications Therefore deuteration is not necessary Developing such an understanding is proposed here by using quasielastic neutron scattering QENS at various environmental conditions such as temperature and recovery time Choice of Instrument We will perform QENS experiments using HFBS with a fine instrument resolution of 08 eV and a momentum transfer coverage of 03 to 185 -1 to capture the local molecular dynamics of the 3D-printing material at different relaxation states HFBS has been proven an instrument of choice to explore polymer dynamics 13 14 Mobility of PEO-modified lignin composites will be within the dynamics range covered by HFBS Experiment Plan In this study we have performed various rheological in situ SANS and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements and established protocols that guide the experimental plan We will measure 5 PEO-modified lignin composites including a neat sample control two samples of 30 and 50 wt hardwood lignin and two samples of 30 and 50 wt softwood lignin The presence of different Figure 2 Elastic scan of a 3D-printing material made from a modified lignin 50 wt with polyethylene oxide PEO measured in HFBS Inset magnifies the highlighted region lignin types and lignin content results in different morphological characteristics that form a 3D-network structure with different molecular dynamics Quasielastic neutron scattering QENS measurements will be conducted at two selected temperatures 70 C and 21 C RT After measuring at 70 C the sample will be cooled down to 21 C RT At RT with no shear rate applied the sample will be measured in situ every 4-hours 3 times during molecular relaxation The estimated beamtime for each sample is 20h including the sample loading and unloading time So the total time we need for the measurements is 100h Since we have PEO-modified lignin composites weighted contribution from PEO will be subtracted from the composites during the data analysis Including sample specific resolution measurements the total beamtime we request is about 5 days to complete all the measurements All samples are available and ready for the measurements The samples will be loaded in a flat plate aluminum can and sealed with In wire References 1 A J
