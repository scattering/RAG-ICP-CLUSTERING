Diffusion of self-ions and impurities in molten salts for nuclear energy by neutron scattering and ab-initio simulations Scientific motivation In the last decade there has been a sustained resurgence of the Molten-Salt Nuclear Reactor MSR concept Significant RD efforts propelled MSR into the forefront of the next-generation reactor concepts  This and the importance of molten salts in solar energy fusion and industrial processes resulted in a renewed interest in fundamental properties of these liquids  Specifically the design of fully functional MSRs requires detailed knowledge of the molten salt properties at the molecular scale including diffusion coefficients for the salt ions and impurities  Therefore we are conducting a combined program of measurements and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to understand the multi-component melts in particular a solubility and transport of impurities in relation to the ionic-cluster structure of the fluid  Computer modeling is necessary to predict changes in physical and chemical properties due to irradiation and burning of dissolved fuel that results in the presence of more than 10 chemical species in the melt We are applying machine learning to regress from the simulation and experimental data in order to develop a fast-acting model that can handle molten salt with arbitrary 10 number of chemical elements Neutron scattering is crucial to both inform and validate the simulations Our program calls for the use of several inelastic instruments including HFBS single-ion diffusion and DCS dynamic structure factor following initial measurements of pair-distribution function at NOMAD at SNS of NaCl-CrCl3 eutectic see Fig 1 Inelastic measurements are imperative for understanding fundamental properties of technologically important melts Quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS is one of very few methods to measure ionic diffusion Because cold neutrons scatter by diffusing ions QENS results are easy to compare directly with ab initio simulations as was demonstrated recently in NaF  The dynamics of molten salts were measured extensively by neutron scattering in the 80s 5- However these earlier measurements could not measure diffusion at low energy transfer Modern instruments such as HFBS have the energy resolution suitable for such measurements Here we propose to measure NaCl-UCl4 eutectic Both trivalent and tetravalent U species will be present in the melts of working MSRs For uranium- containing chlorides to be noncorrosive toward container materials a small fraction of uranium must be tetravalent UCl4 But the balance between the trivalent and tetravalent actinides will change as a result of accumulation of activation and rare earths fission products and will likely increase the melting point of the salt and change the redox potential In order to predict these effects the structure of U3 and U4 in molten NaCl must be understood by ab initio simulations and measurements Recent computer simulations showed significant difference in the local structure and enhanced network formation by U3  that affect solubility diffusivity etc Proposed measurements will test these results Separate proposals are submitted to measure pair-distribution function NOMAD and SQw of this salt at DCS Preliminary Work The salts are produced and characterized by members of our team regularly and in large quantities using state-of-the-art facilities at the ORNL Chemical Sciences Division  Chloride salts are purified to remove oxidizing impurities Previously we prepared and measured pair-distribution functions of NaCl-CrCl3 eutectic melts at SNS NOMAD and NSLS-II 28-ID We used vacuum-sealed quartz capillaries for the diffraction measurements The results of the July and September 2019 measurements are being analyzed Figure 1 shows the partial PDF from natural and 53Cr-enriched eutectics The First-Order Difference or FOD only contains information about Cr-ion distances Simulated pair-distribution functions are also shown The strong peak in the FOD plot corresponds to Cr-Cl distance at 24 A Ab initio simulations of NaCl-CrClx and NaCl-UClx are ongoing including training the neural-network potentials and preliminary simulations Experimental approach The incoherent-scattering signal from NaCl-UClx will be dominated by the diffusivity of Cl due to its large incoherent cross-section Our ab initio simulations of a similar salt NaCl-CrCl3 predicted Cl diffusion coefficient of 10-10 m2s at 600 C just above melting see Fig 2 This is right within the range of HFBS which has been used to measure diffusion coefficients in liquids Figure 1 left Measurements of partial PDF FOD First-Order Difference is the difference between Gr or NaCl-natCrCl3 and NaCl-53CrCl3 The FOD contains contributions only from Cr distances Cr-Cl Cr-Na and Cr-Cr This is because of the difference in the scattering-length density of 53Cr and natCr b53-420b bnat3635b Right Ab initio MD simulations Figure 2 Preliminary ab-initio simulations of mean-square displacement and diffusion coefficients of ions in NaCl-CrCl3 melt HFBS can use a CCR suitable for heating NaCl-UCl4 above melting To fill the available volume in the furnace up to 05 cm3 of the sample is needed about 1 g Such quantities are within our abilities and budget Samples will be loaded into the furnace in Mo or Nb containers Tubes of 05 cm diameter will be arc welded and tested in our furnace This thickness is about 1e for absorption due to Cl therefore the absorption will be accounted for We plan for 12 hours per sample in the furnace to allow for heating measurements and cooling Two samples plus calibration and empty cells will require two days Adding contingency we are requesting three days in total We will require a standard close-cycle refrigerator Salts will be vacuum-sealed and tested for leakage at home institution The salt is toxic therefore it will be sealed and handled accordingly Depleted U will be used to prepare the salt to reduce activation in the neutron beam References  DF Williams PF Britt Technology and Applied RD Needs for Molten Salt Chemistry Oak Ridge National
