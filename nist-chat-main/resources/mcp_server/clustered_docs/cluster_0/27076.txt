 Proton dynamics in novel high-temperature PEM fuel cell materials Albert Lee Yu Seung Kim Marilyn Hawley Rex Hjelm Local Contact Timothy Prisk Statement of Research Scientific Importance High-temperature proton electrolyte fuel cells HT-PEMFCs are attractive energy conversion devices that operate above 100oC without humidification1 A new class of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membranes HT-PEMs have been developed for HT-PEMFC applications In these system protons donated by phosphoric acid conduct through phosphate hydrogen bond networks There are three polymers of current interest as HT-PEM materials PBI-PA PWN77 and QAP-PA in phosphoric acid PA and water Fig 1 Fig 2c the later of which imparts remarkable improvements in both fuel cell performance and durability2 QAP-PA and PWN77 differ from PBI-PA in having proton conducting phosphonate groups covalently tethered to the organic backbone Figs 1 and 2c Figure 1 Small molecule representation of the interaction between polymer and H conducting phosphate phase Implementing these new materials into practical HT-PEMFC systems needs understanding the proton conduction mechanism through the phosphate phases to determine the optimal content of PA3 as too much phosphatephosphonic acid causes multiple issues such as mechanical property deterioration electrode flooding and catalyst poisoning Recent efforts combining ab-initio MD simulations4-6 and experimental results7-9 revealed the conduction mechanism in HT-PEM model systems of phosphoric phosphoric acid with imidazole and benzimidazole and showed that protons exchange between phosphate species on the sub-picosecond to picosecond scale along frustrated hydrogen bond networks Related work on localized water diffusion in the commercial perfluoronated fuel cell ionomer Nafion showed a characteristic jump time 3 ps10-13 as well as proton diffusion over longer time scales due to confinement and free diffusion11-12 14-15 Relevant to this proposal is work on PBI-PA16 which points to the heterogeneous character of the time and length scales associated with proton transport in this system Our overall programmatic goal is to understand the proton conduction through PA in each of the HT-PEMs as a function of stoichiometry of polymer bound PAfree PAwater and temperature Our objective is to test a hypothesis formulated from work on model4-9 and related ionomer polymer PEM systems10-15 that proton transport involves multi-length and time scale processes16 including frustrated hydrogen bond network jumps geometry confined and free diffusion Previous Results Our conductivity measurements for the three polymers show several orders of magnitude change with temperature Fig 2a3 and an order of magnitude with the amount of phosphoric acid doping Fig 2b The effect is different for polymer electrolyte thus these two variables are sensitive probes of proton transport in these polymers Figure 2 Proton conductivities as a function of a temperature and b relative humidity of c polymer electrolytes proposed to be studied Proton transport in novel HT-PEM fuel cell materials 2 We conducted our first inverse geometry QENS measurements with two objectives 1 determine if it is possible to discriminate the static polymer hydrogen from the dynamic PA water protons at the extremes of static hydrogen content PBI-PA and QP-PA Fig 2c and 2 determine if it is possible to discern a temperature dependence of the contribution of static to dynamic protons in these systems at the extremes of temperature-dependent conductivity Fig 2a The answers to these questions are important for our plans for further work Our approach was to measure PBI-PA and QAP-PA membranes swollen in aqueous PA H-form and with deuterated PA in D2O D-form using a molar ratio of polymer residue PRPAwater of 111 corresponding to the maximum PA doping level having stable maximum proton conductivity Fig 1b We chose two measurement temperatures 298 and 353 K over which the macroscopic conductivity is maximal differing by roughly an order of magnitude for PBI-PA less so for QAP-PA Fig 2a HFBS measurements with an incident energy of 208 meV and a dynamic window of 15eV were fitted to a linear background elastic Gaussian and single inelastic Lorentzian components for each measured Q using the PAN tool of the DAVE analysis program17 The ratio of the areas of the fitted elastic component to those of the total of the fitted elastic and inelastic components the EISF18 was computed as a function of Q using PAN The EISF of PBI-PA and QAP-PA in PA H-forms showed a substantially greater EISF in the D-form compared to the H-form Fig 3 Likewise the EISF was greater at 298 K than at 353 K in all four samples consistent with the result of fixed window scans from 200 to 400 K showing substantial increase in dynamic processes both H-form samples over this temperature range We concluded from these results that it is plausible to discriminate the static from dynamic protons in both of these systems and also as a function of temperature Proposed Research From the results of our first measurements we have selected PBI-PA for our initial studies to look at the question of the proton dynamics underlying conductivity with polymer residue PR PAwater ratios Fig 2b Here we propose to conduct measurements using DCS on PBI-PA to assess the shortest time and length scales of the putative proton jump process We will measure samples at PRPAH2O molar ratios 111 corresponding to maximum proton conductivity and at higher water contents of 112 and 113 where the conductivity is lower Fig 2b The QENS of fully pronated samples will be compared with those from deuterated PA and D2O at the same molar ratios as the H-forms to discriminate the static hydrogen structure factors from the dynamic ones When completed the lesson learned from this work will be applied to similar studies of the other two HT-PEM polymers The analysis for QENS from of dynamics mechanisms is known11-12 14-15 for the short time and length scale transport processes Interpretation of the experimental work will supported by molecular dynamics MD simulations to calculate intermediate scattering function These will be performed at the University of New Mexico using Large-scale AtomicMolecular Massively Parallel Simulator lammps code Temperature dependent QENS measurements will allow investigation the polymers influence on the activation energy of the fast proton exchange while detailed analysis of spectra and intermediate scattering function will allow a detailed comparison to the simulation This proposal differs from and complements previous published work on PBI-PA16 Here we ask a well defined question as to the role of phosphate and water content in the macroscopic proton conductivity by using well defined preparations with different PRPAwater content Furthermore the analysis will include models of known transport process and MD simulations to tease out the details of the dynamic properties Choice of Instrument Spectrometers with different incident energies dynamic windows and Q-domains are needed to probe the different time and length scales to completely characterize the mechanisms of proton dynamics10-14 16 DCS19 provides access to the h and Q domains proton dynamics over smaller time scales to complement data from proposed measurements on HFBS20 and on BASIS21 approved for beam time that will provide data on slower diffusive motions Expected Results Measurements on water dynamics in alkaline electrolyte membranes using TOFTOF22 provide guidance likely observations from PBI-PA Although the phosphoric acid-water system is likely to be more complex due to the different proton chemical environments at least two water content and temperature-dependent dynamic mechanisms are likely within the dynamic window of DCS rotation and and Hall-Ross jump diffusion Calculation of beam time We request 3 days of beamtime Our plan includes 6 samples each at 4 temperatures between 250 and 400 K a background measurement and an additional low temperature measurement for the instrumental resolution function Estimated measurement time for each sample is 2 hours thus 8 hours for each of 6 samples and 4 065070750808509095102 04 06 08 1 12 14 16QAP H D EISF 298 KQAP HQAP DA QQ -107075080850902 04 06 08 1 12 14 16PBI H
