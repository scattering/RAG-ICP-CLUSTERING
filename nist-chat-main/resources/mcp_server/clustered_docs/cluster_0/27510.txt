Scientific Importance Membrane-based water purification and desalination processes have become progressively more important as the global demand for clean and safe water sources increases In addition to naturally occurring impurities eg minerals salts microbes present in earths native water sources ie oceans rivers lakes anthropomorphic contaminants have presented an additional complexity to purification in recent years as a result of industrial agricultural and municipal runoff This severity of this problem has been underscored by DOE-led initiatives such as the 100M Energy-Water Desalination Hub NAWI aimed at providing secure and affordable water A variety of membrane-based technologies have been developed to mitigate this problem which ultimately remove contaminants by a size exclusion mechanism Reverse osmosis RO membrane-based technologies are at the forefront of water purification due to their highly efficient effluent rejection process and minimal energy consumption ca factor of two above the thermodynamic limit Werber et al In the RO process pressure is applied to one side of the membrane in order to counteract the osmotic pressure which results from a concentration gradient Recent efforts in this realm have focused on optimizing the selectivity and permeability of a particular class of polyamide PA membranes for RO processes PA membranes are commonly synthesized from the interfacial polymerization of trimesoyl chloride TMC and m-phenylene diamine MPD which are suspended in immiscible organic and aqueous solvents respectively Although this polymerization reaction is not well controlled from a chemists perspective the frequently reported product is a highly cross-linked semi-amorphous polymer composite It has been demonstrated that the primary factors which influence the separation efficiency of RO membranes are the thickness chemical composition cross-linking structure and surface roughness The cross-linking structure and resulting transport pathways can be controlled by varying synthesis conditions eg precursor concentrations structural isomers etc Recent molecular dynamics MD studies have sought to model the interfacial polymerization reaction on an atomic scale Muscatello et al in order to provide an enhanced understanding of the resulting membrane structure and resulting water transport however there are very few experimental results with a level of detail sufficient to make comparisons In the current approach we are applying a host of advanced characterization techniques using the complementarity of x-rays SLAC neutrons NIST and electrons SLACLBNL to determine structure-property relationships which will ultimately provide information necessary for improving the design of state-of-the-art RO membranes as the thermodynamic limit is approached Neutron spectroscopy is a critical component of this effort providing the most sensitive measure of the water-membrane interaction and resulting transport due to the large incoherent neutron scattering cross section of hydrogen The ultimate goal for the proposed QENS measurements is two-fold First we aim to resolve discrepancies in the literature regarding the diffusion mechanism and resulting dynamical parameters of water in PA membranes which ultimately result from a very limited set of neutron measurements poor instrumental resolution or lack of control over hydration We expect that the long-range and localized diffusion contributions to the structure factor are dependent on the extent of hydration which has been suggested previously for water in anion exchange membranes AEM Melchior et al hydrogels Fratini et al and MD of PA membranes Cui et al The results would also potentially validate structural and diffusion models recently generated by fully-atomistic MD simulations Secondly these measurements are designed to provide baseline transport properties for existing state-of-the-art PA membranes to which the efficiency of newly developed membranes will be compared Preliminary Work It has been made apparent by the desalination community that there is an inherent lack of fundamental knowledge about the water-membrane interaction Current efforts at SLAC are geared towards providing an atomic-scale understanding of the interaction between water and PA membranes for RO processes and determining how the structure ultimately influences the transport of water molecules during the desalination process The Toney group at SLAC in collaboration with Spackowitz and Tarpeh groups at Stanford is using a suite of advanced characterization techniques which combines x-ray APSneutron PDF LANSCEISIS TBD SAXSWAXS XAS SLAC-SSRL and electron microscopy SLAC-CryoEM to derive structure-property relationships and provide evidence for the membrane fouling mechanism Neutron experiments are focused on the structure and dynamics of water confined in the PA membrane whereas x-ray and electron-based techniques are more suitable for understanding the structure and fouling of the membrane In the future we would like to perform a vibrational spectroscopic experiment at DCS to complement DRIFTS measurements NREL where the intermolecular forces at the water-membrane interface can be modeled Early MD simulations focused primarily on PA structure formation during polymerization at the water-hexane interface which generates a nearly realistic model MD previously limited in accuracy due to course-grained approximations have been improved in recent years by employing an all-atom approach made possible by parameterized semi-empirical forcefields Simulations fixed on the PA structure project a bimodal distribution of voids one with regions of strong molecular confinement ie appreciable interaction with NH OH groups and the other where water is coordinated with adjacent water molecules Density maps from these simulations also suggest that uptake occurs to a greater extent near the surface within the surface roughness than the middle of the membrane which highlight the potential for heterogeneity in dynamics Recently published work by Cui et al supports this hypothesis by suggesting high-frequency jump diffusion is responsible for anomalous dynamics which occurs more frequently at high coverages when the nearest neighbor is a water molecule and the jump length is comparable to the size of a water molecule The model generated by Cui et al was chosen as the ideal starting point in our work and will be further developed as experimental data becomes available Choice of Instrument We requested HFBS due to its timelength scale capabilities Conclusions from previous QENS results Sharma Muscatello personal comm have suggested self-diffusivities for water inside PA membranes 300K with an order of magnitude of variation HFBS is suitable to resolve this discrepancy further expand the model and account for small step continuous diffusion and as such is the only instrument at NCNR which can provide sufficient resolution for accurate determination of both long-range and localized diffusive motions at relevant time scales for both the PA membrane and water We have communicated with Craig Brown in advance to confirm the ability of HFBS to resolve these dynamics Experiment Plan and Data Analysis The experimental plan is separated into two parts 1 Initially the signal from hydrogen bound to the PA membrane and water will need to be disentangled In order to elucidate this behavior a temperature-coverage series will be required using D2O to mask the dynamical contribution from the water The amine and terminal carboxyl ie non-crosslinked sites hydrogens are susceptible to H-D exchange and thus only the hydrogens bonded to carbons will need to be included in the model of backbone dynamics If recent work by Fratini et al is used as a guide only a contribution from localized PA backbone terminal MPD and cross-linking side chain dynamics likely having similar time scales need to be described as long-range motions will likely be too slow for the instrumental window If these slower dynamics are determined to have some value NSE can be used in a future experiment The time dependence of the polyamide dynamics will be described by a KWW function which is commonly used in the literature to describe non-exponential relaxations observed in polymer dynamics Any rotational dynamics in the PA can be analyzed in accordance with the approach used by Fratini although the CH dynamics are likely too fast for the HFBS instrumental window 2 Following the complete analysis of membrane dynamics the hydration dependence of water diffusion can be determined We will introduce highly-puredegassed water to the sample in a controlled manner using a simplified version of the Larese Mursic et al gas handling manifold This type of controlled in situ dosing has been demonstrated previously for highly condensible vapors at low temperature see Crain et al for water on silk fibroin Strange et al for decane on MgO Accurate and reproducible control over the coverage allows us to determine how long-range and localized dynamics of water molecules evolve as a function of coverage and resulting polymer swelling and temperature It is anticipated that at minimum three coverages will be measured as a function of temperature 02sat 075sat and sat Ultimately this provides dilute saturated and intermediate coverages The coverage calibration will be performed at SLAC prior to arrival If capillary condensation is a concern for the HFBS team the samples can be dosed in advance subsequently sealed and measured ex situ using a modified detachable Al sample cell We will use the temperature range of Sharma et al as a guide and make 20K incremental changes between 230 and 330K We request a total of five days for the total experiment six samples 3 D2O 3 H2O coverages measured for approximately five hours each at five temperatures each  four days plus an additional day to account for in-between dosing sample can background vanadium calibration and any additional statistics needed We plan to use Mantid and DAVE to processanalyze the resulting QENS spectra In the regime where translational diffusion propagates 269K we will start with the simplest QE broadening model Lorentzian although it is anticipated that a distribution of relaxation times will be required to describe heterogeneity in both the membrane and water dynamics as indicated by MD simulations In this case the KWW function is used typically with  05 for polymer dynamics and 04-09 for water depending on Q and coverage QENS results from water in AEM have successfully fit the jump diffusion to the Hall-Ross model which has also proven effective for soft-confined water MD by Cui et al display a combination of jump diffusion separated into low D  1110-10 m2s and high frequency D  4410-10 m2s as well as small-step continuous diffusion with the former dominating at high water coverages Evaluating rotational diffusion is more complex considering convoluted dynamics but has been successfully performed previously by Melchior et al using the apparent EISF yielding a rotation radius on the order of the OH bond length Safety Considerations The samples and experimental apparatus used in this study do not present any safety concerns The PA membrane which will be used is commercially available DOW FT-30 and non-hazardous Water vapors will be confined in a gas-handling manifold which will require a turbo-molecular pump and cold-trap The sample can be disposed of assuming it is not activated when the experiment is completed References 1 Crain CA Strange NA Larese JZ Mater Res Soc Symp Proc 2015 1793 41-46 2 Cui F Chen W Kong X Liu L Shi C Li Y J Phys Chem B
