Hybrid Tri-Modality Tomography of Unsaturated Moisture Flow in Cementitious Material Laura E Dalton Jacob LaManna Scott Jones and Mohammad Pour-Ghaz I Introduction We propose to perform simultaneous dynamic neutron X-ray and impedance tomography of unsaturated moisture flow in cement-based materials While this experiment will be performed on cementitious material the methodology developed is general and can be applied to other porous media including ceramics rocks and soil Cementitious material has been selected because the research team has extensive experience with this material and because its transport properties can be controlled to assist in reducing the duration of the experiment Simultaneous neutron and X-ray imaging is routinely performed at NIST The addition of electrical impedance tomography EIT to neutron and X-ray imaging modalities enables the simultaneous reconstruction of 3D spatial distribution of electrical impedance and its evolution as a function of time Electrical impedance properties cannot be measured using neutron or X-ray imaging The proposed tri-modality measurement therefore enables time varying 3D 4D information on transport within the material that cannot be obtained with only one or two of these modalities Neutron and X-ray imaging both have high spatial resolution typically at the order of a few micrometers while EIT has a low spatial resolution typically at the order of a few millimeters depending on the measurements On the other hand EIT has a high temporal resolution a few microseconds per projection as compared to neutron and X-ray a few seconds per projection When used simultaneously the spatial and temporal resolution of these modalities is complementary with EIT monitoring rapid mass transport at low spatial resolution and detailed information obtained at different semi-stationary snapshots using neutrons and X-rays A step further in this direction is the use of hybrid imaging where information from multiple imaging modalities are mathematically combined to enhance the reconstructions from one or all modalities In the proposed experiment EIT provides the added benefits of being fast relatively inexpensive radiation-free and applicable to larger samples However the main drawback of EIT is the resolution capabilities and to date there has not been any successful experiment to show how well EIT can capture the movement of water in porous media The main challenge is that to corroborate EIT measurements the measurements have to be performed on samples suitable for both measurements ie EIT and neutron In the proposed experiment combining all three methods to analyze small samples can assist in understanding the capabilities and limitation of EIT to later be applied to more realistic infrastructure-scales The objective of the present study is to perform simultaneous neutron X-ray and EIT on cement-based materials during unsaturated moisture ingress with three goals i compare the results of EIT against neutron tomography to establish EIT limits ii use neutron and X-ray imaging results in an hybrid imaging framework to enhance the resolution of EIT reconstructions and iii test scatter-corrective methods to mitigate scanning artifacts A total of six days 144 hours of neutron imaging facility time is requested for this study II Background Neutron and X-ray tomography have been extensively used to monitor moisture flow in cementitious materials Hallaji et al  used simultaneous two-dimensional EIT and neutron radiography to monitor moisture flow in cement paste Figure 1A Due to the qualitative nature of the measurements neutron imaging could not be used to enhance EIT Moreover Smyl et al  used qualitative three-dimensional 3D EIT to monitor moisture flow in 4-inch diameter mortar cylinders EIT and X-ray tomography results were compared Figure 1B however the sample size was too large and the data could not be used for EIT calibration We propose simultaneous neutron X-ray and EIT on smaller samples to see if hybrid imaging can be used to enhance EIT Figure 1 A Neutron radiography and EIT  and B 3D EIT and X-ray CT  From previous experiments neutron attenuation of water was found to fluctuate with fine aggregate content in mortar which may be a result of scatter Methods have been developed to correct for neutron scatter using Black-Body Grids BBG  This method uses a grid containing carefully placed material that blocks the beam path to the detector placed between the source and sample during scanning At all locations of the blocking material the detector will show zero counts When counts are observed this can accurately be characterized as scatter and used to correct scatter in the neutron images leading to more representative detail of water movement III Proposed Experiments Six calibration mortar samples made with different degrees of saturation will be tested using BBG to obtain quantitative calibration curves for neutron and X-ray measurements For this study a BBG designed specifically for the NIST detector will be used to further improve the neutron results as a continuation of previous corrective scatter research completed at NIST The BBG will be placed between the source and sample during each radiograph Tri-modalities will be performed on two cylindrical 1-inch diameter by 2-inch long samples made with the same mortar composition ie water-to-cement ratio and fine particle sand as the aforementioned calibration mortar discs Each cylinder will contain a single large 05-inch diameter limestone or granite aggregate to provide different electrical conductivities and absorptions Teflon water reservoirs will be installed on the specimen surface prior to arrival An assemblage of Teflon shrink-wrap will be used to secure EIT equipment to the sample during scanning and slip wires will be used to eliminate the wires from EIT needing to rotate with the sample High resolution tri-modality tomography measurements will be taken with the dry reservoir in place before the addition of water followed by sparse tomography in intervals during ingress An overview of the projected time to complete the experiments is listed in Table 1 A B Table 1 Projected Experiment Timeline Task Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 BBG SetupMortar Disc Preparation Moisture Disc Calibration using Neutron EIT Setup Simultaneous Hybrid Modalities Sample 1 Simultaneous Hybrid Modalities Sample 2 III1 Neutron Tomography Sparse tomography at approximately 6o intervals at 60 second exposures corresponding to a total scan time of 1 hour will be completed Moisture flow will be monitored for 24 hours to obtain a profile close to the steady state moisture distribution inside the sample The water movement over the scan periods is a highly averaged process making the water diffusion front location difficult to decipher between scan intervals To achieve more representative information on the water front location between scans three reconstruction techniques will be used 1 sliding 360-degree reconstructions 2 Time Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction TIMBIR 4- and 3 using the dry high-resolution scan as a seed for the dynamic scans III2 X-Ray Tomography X-ray will be collected in parallel to neutron scans Reconstruction of both the neutron and X-ray scans will be compared to determine the lower limit of moisture detection by X-ray tomography X-ray images will assist in providing material detail for inclusion cement paste and fine aggregate boundaries with respect to the water movement captured in the neutron scan III3 Electrical Impedance Tomography EIT EIT measurements using NC State equipment will be taken simultaneously with neutron and X-ray imaging modalities The number of measurements will be optimized to reduce the duration of each scan while obtaining sufficient number of measurements for high resolution reconstructions With respect to sample size the 1-inch diameter samples used in this study are smaller than those used in prior EIT studies as shown in Figure 1 From laboratory studies a 1-inch sample is the size threshold for obtaining a representative result for moisture migration in concrete using EIT IV Expected Results This study will provide the first comparison of 3D EIT used for monitoring unsaturated flow against neutron imaging and therefore the current limitations and potential capabilities of EIT as an imaging modality for material characterization will be realized The results of neutron and X-ray tomography will be used for hybrid imaging of cement-based materials potentially providing high resolution reconstruction of spatial and temporal distribution of electrical impedance within the material This study will also contribute to understanding the role of neutron scatter to further reduce unwanted artifacts that complicate post-scan data analysis V References  Hallaji et al 2015 ERT to monitor unsaturated moisture flow in
