The effect of salts and microbial respiration on conjugated polyelectrolyte networks Samantha McCuskey Luana Llanes and Guillermo Bazan UC Santa Barbara Motivation A biocomposite consisting of the electrogenic bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and the self-p-doped conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE-K can be used in the field of microbial electrochemical technologies as a means to three-dimensionally integrate microbes with an electrode Biocomposites shows capacitive behavior and a lower charge transfer resistance than the case of the polymer without bacteria suggesting that microbial respiration through the polymer network optimizes the matrix for current extraction leading to changes in morphology We propose SANS experiments to probe the effect of salt concentration and bacteria respiration on the local polymer chain rigidity and structure of the conjugated polyelectrolyte gels Background Conjugated polyelectrolytes CPEs are a class of polymers consisting of a -conjugated backbone with pendant ionic groups These water-soluble semiconductors have applications in organic optoelectronic devices as well as for chemical and biological sensors CPE-K see Fig 1 is a narrow bandgap polyelectrolyte that self-p-dopes forms radical cations in aqueous solution At 40 mg mL-1 in water CPE-K forms a thermo-reversible gel Neutron and X-ray scattering indicate that the assembly of the polymer towards gel formation is driven primarily by electrostatics forming a three-dimensional 3D network with interchain correlation lengths of 137  02 nm Ionic aggregates work as dynamic physical crosslinks tying separate chains together While - stacking is not evident by X-ray scattering gels show both electronic and ionic conduction by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS Because CPE-K is water soluble and can form soft 3D conductive networks it has the opportunity to be applied in bioelectrochemical systems BESs Certain anaerobic bacteria can interface with electrodes to catalyze the interconversion of chemical and electrical energy as part of their respiration process Indeed BESs based on microbial electroactivity have been developed including microbial fuel cells for wastewater remediation and bioelectrosynthesis platforms where bacteria produce desired chemical products Electrodes with greater dimensionality have the advantage of larger specific surface areas for bacteria attachment increased catalyst loading Porous monolithic 3D electrodes have been used but biofilms must gradually form within their structure and clogging can occur An alternative strategy to 3D integration is via formation of bacteriasoft conductive material composites in which the conductive matrix and biofilm are spontaneously organized Recently we have used CPE-K as the synthetic component to create a biocomposite with the electroactive microorganism S oneidensis MR-1 In this case CPE-K acts as a 3D extension of the electrode surface increasing the number of microbes that can be electronically accessed leading to a 150-fold increase in biocurrent extracted compared to control biofilms The electronic properties of the biocomposites have shown to evolve over time and understanding the impact of salt concentration and bacteria respiration on the polymer gel network is essential to understanding the current enhancement Attempts to characterize the morphology of the biocomposite have proven difficult Scanning electron microscopy SEM gives bulk structural information but due to preparation of the sample the structure may not match the in situ arrangement While we also plan to use X-ray scattering techniques SANS will give quantitative data that can be fit to a model to provide structural parameters Also SAXS may kill the bacteriadegrade the sample while the cold neutron beam in SANS is a passive probe of the microstructure Fig 1 Chemical structures of self-p-doped conjugated polyelectrolytes  B Liu et al John Wiley  Sons 2013  C K

control biofilms reached steady-state current generation densities of 13  04 mA m-2 while controls of sterile 20 mg mL-1 CPE-K in growth media showed 12  10 mA m-2 When S oneidensis MR-1 is combined with 20 mg mL-1 CPE-K 198  17 mA m-2 is produced a 150-fold enhancement over the controls Electrode surfaces were imaged after biocurrent testing to examine the organizational relationships of the biocomposites Samples were chemically fixed dried and sputtered with gold prior to imaging with SEM The control containing only microbes shows a sparse monolayer biofilm on the electrode In the sterile CPE-K control the polymer is condensed in sheet-like aggregates on the surface For the biocomposites one observes both cells and CPE-K which also appears sheet-like Cross-sectional views of the biocomposite Fig 2a show that cells reside not only on the top surface but are also well interspersed between the polymer material Cyclic voltammetry CV and EIS performed after current collection are shown in Fig 2b and c Catalytic electron transfer through membrane proteins is observed for CV of control biofilms not shown CPE-K-only controls show oxidation of the polymer at E  200 mV CV measurements of the biocomposites exhibit substantially higher current densities and unexpectedly shaped curves The biocomposites show rectangular-shaped waves reminiscent of what is seen for pseudocapacitors We attribute the pseudocapacitive behavior of the CPE-Kbacteria composite to the formation of a polymer matrix with more continuous interchain contacts that facilitate electron transport to the electrode EIS gives Nyquist plots consisting of a classical semicircle representing the resistance to charge transfer RCT followed by a linear response at low frequencies From equivalent circuit fitting RCT is 30  for the biocomposite which is considerably smaller than what is found for the sterile CPE-K control 150  The linear response at low frequencies also transitions from a 45 angle to a more vertical orientation signifying a shift from slow mass transport of ions to the electrode surface to better capacitive behavior by way of the conducting matrix in the biocomposite Taken as a whole CV and EIS results reveal a synergistic action of the two components in the biocomposite towards optimizing charge transport to the electrode Given that there is not an increase in free charge carriers in the composite the drop in resistance compared to the control condition suggests a change in polymer network morphology Our current results do not directly measure structural differences between the polymer by itself in a salt solution and the polymer in the biocomposite SANS provides the best means to characterize interchain correlation distances and microgel confirmations while the materials are in the hydrated state Morphology characterization will bring a better understanding of how the structure impacts bioelectricity generation and how the respiration of bacteria on the polymer can direct network formation Preliminary SANS measurements of CPE-K in bacteria growth media provide the morphological information needed see below  E Marsili et al Appl Environ Microbiol 2008 74 7329-7337  T S Mathis et al Adv Energy Mater 2019 9 1902007 Detailed experimental plan 1 CPE-K in media at different ionic strengths The increased ionic strength of growth media as opposed to water could increase ionic crosslinking leading to shorter interchain correlations improving electron mobility through the polymer network CPE-K will be dissolved in Shewanella Basal Media SBM in D2O 30 mM potassium phosphate at appropriate concentrations 3 mg mL-1 CPE-K to elucidate chain confirmation in the dilute limit and 10 20 and 30 mg mL-1 CPE-K to investigate electrostatic interactions The concentration of SBM will be varied between 05x and 2x to investigate how ionic strength impacts network formation Because this salt range is amenable to microbial health its effect can be used to help tune the gel structure Solutions in titanium sample cells with quartz windows 1 mm path length will be equilibrated for 72 hours before measuring Initial testing Fig 3a of CPE-K in SBM shows the classic Polyelectrolyte peak which can be fit using the model in Ref 3 to extract form and structure factors From the peak position the interchain correlation length of CPE-K in 05x SBM is 175 nm 0036 -1 Interestingly CPE-K shows drastically different structures as the salt concentration is varied across 05-2x SBM In total study 1 will require measurements of 18 samples 2 CPE-K with S oneidensis MR-1 Biocomposites with 10 20 and 30 mg mL-1 CPE-K and two loading concentrations of bacteria will be prepared in deuterated SBM After electrochemical polarization samples will be characterized by SANS Due to the low volume fraction of bacteria compared to the CPE-K we anticipate that the SANS measurement will be dominated by the scattering of the polymer enabling us to apply the same polyelectrolyte model as in study 1 In total study 2 will require measurement of 8 samples 3 Initial characterization of new p-doped conjugated polyelectrolytes To develop a more comprehensive understanding of how the backbone molecular structure impacts 3D network formation we will investigate three new CPEs in D2O at 3 and 40 mg mL-1 Initial testing shows that IDTBT Fig 1 and 2b has an interchain correlation length of 76 nm q  0083 -1 which is smaller than that of CPE-K Combining these measurements with electrochemical testing will enable us to assess the impact of polymer correlation length and ionic aggregate spacing on intrinsic charge transport In total study 3 will require 12 samples Three sample-detector distances will be used 13 4 and 13 m with a neutron wavelength of 6  yielding a q range of 00034 - 04 -1 which is necessary to resolve structural features predicted from the model Based on the preliminary SANS measurements we expect the average sample to take 1 hour to probe this q range We request 25 days of beam time on NGB30SANS 1 day to probe CPE-K in different salt solutions 075 days to probe CPE-K under the influence of microbial respiration and 075 days to investigate the gel structures of new materials This estimate includes background and calibration measurements Impact and analysis 1D analysis of the resulting SANS data will give structural parameters of CPEs in salt solutions indicating means by which the gel morphology can be tuned without modifications of chemical structure Testing of biocomposites will reveal if the electroactive bacterias respiration affects the polyelectrolyte network structure Different CPE backbones can bring insight into the synthesis of new materials for bioelectrochemical applications  S P O Danielsen et al Chem Mater 2018 30 1417-1426
