 Page 1 of 3 Study on the Segmental Dynamics of Polymer Electrolytes in a Battery Cathode PI X Chelsea Chen Oak Ridge National Laboratory chenxornlgov Scientific Background and Anticipated Impact A stable lithium anode is critical to achieve high energy density with excellent safety lifetime and cycling efficiency The overarching goal of this work is to identify key design strategies to prepare solid electrolytes and matching solid composite cathode to meet the challenging physical chemical and manufacturing requirements to protect and stabilize the lithium metal anode for advanced batteries Success in this program will enable specific DOE technical targets 500-700Whkg 3000-5000 deep discharge cycles and robust operation Polymer electrolytes are a promising class of solid electrolytes towards enabling lithium anode as they eliminate the flammability concerns of traditional liquid electrolytes2 In an all solid-state battery polymer electrolytes may be used as the both the electrolyte layer as well as in the solid composite cathode as the catholyte In such a composite cathode a thin layer polymer electrolyte coats the active particles such as LiFePO4 and is responsible for ion transport in and out of the active particle The effect of cathode materials surface on the segmental dynamics and ionic conductivity of polymer electrolyte has not been studied Quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS provides unique and valuable insights into segmental dynamics in polymers 3-5 In the proposed work we aim to use QENS to understand the effect of cathode active particles on the segmental dynamics in polymer electrolytes in a cathode environment Proposed Work In a recent publication of ours1 the dynamics of PEO chains forming the matrix of a composite electrolyte is investigated upon contact with a doped LixAlyTi2PO43-type ceramic electrolyte Using quasi-elastic neutron scattering Figure 1 we discovered diminished segmental motion of PEO chains near the surface of ceramic particles The underpinnings of these results may be that polymer chains in the vicinity of the ceramic surface are less mobile due to coordination with surface bound lithium ions In this work we propose to examine the dynamics of PEO chains in a solid-state battery cathode In a composite cathode consisting of PEOlithium salt carbon black and active particles the polymer electrolyte and is responsible for ion transport in and out of the active particle Confinement effect from the complicated environment of the cathode may have profound impact on the segmental dynamics of the polymer electrolyte which in turn affects the ionic conductivity In this work we will examine the dynamics of the cathode in 3 states pristine state prior to cycling after a cycle ending in charge and after a cycle ending in discharge To our knowledge this is the first time such experiment has been proposed Figure 1 Quasi-elastic neutron scattering reveals that the segmental motion of PEO chains in the composite electrolyte decreased by 60 compared to neat polymer electrolyte1 011000204060810Q  047 -1 363KSQtt nsPEOPEOceramicPEOsaltPEOsaltceramic Page 2 of 3 Experiment Plan In this work we will fabricate a solid composite cathode using a standard polymer electrolyte consisting of polyethylene oxide PEO and lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide LiTFSI salt Polymer electrolyte carbon black and LiFePO4 in weight ratios of 20575 will be mixed in de-ionized water to form a slurry The slurry will be cast onto carbon-coated aluminum current collector and dried in vacuum at 120  The dried cathode will be calendared The cathode will be further dried in the glovebox antechamber and stored in the glovebox for future use All of these materials are commercially available The composite cathode will be approximately 30 m thick for optimum cycling performance We will then sputter a 20 m thick layer of a ceramic electrolyte lithium phosphorous oxynitride Lipon onto the cathode This electrolyte has been proven to have long term cycling capability6 and it does not contain 1H Then 6 m of lithium metal will be thermally evaporated onto Lipon to complete the cell In this design the only material that contains 1H is PEO The scattering intensity from PEO will dominate the other materials Samples to be submitted in this proposal are summarized in Table 1 Table 1 Samples to be

uncycled samples will be prepared by cutting a piece of sample with the size of 3 cm x 5 cm 3-5 layers of samples will be stacked together to ensure enough scattering intensity The samples will be sealed in the aluminum can with indium wires in the Ar glovebox To cycle the battery large area battery 3 cm x 5 cm with the cathodeLiponLi configuration will be vacuum-sealed in pouch cells Cycling will be performed in house with our equipment After cycling the pouch cell will be dissembled 3-5 batteries will be stacked together and sealed in aluminum cans We will perform an elastic scan on heating and collect QENS data at two temperatures resolution and QENS data at 363 K for each sample Based on our previous experience the proposed plan will require approximately 4 days The team members will use several QENS data analysis packages including MantidPlot7 and Dave8 to extrapolate the time and Q dependence of PEO chain dynamics List of Prior Publications 1 Chen X C Sacci R L Osti
