 Morphology Study of Green Solvents Processed Polymer Blends using Neutron Scattering Bhoj Gautam Department of Chemistry Physics and Materials Science Fayetteville State University Fayetteville NC 28301-4252 Organic semiconductors have been intensively studied due to their unique electronic and optical properties Their properties - including relatively easy and inexpensive fabrication light weight mechanical flexibility and compatibility with stretchability - open broad prospects for their applications in variety of industrial and technological areas including solar cells 1  Significant focus of research involves developing new materials or advancing different processing methods to increase the power conversion efficiency PCE of organic solar cells OSCs3  The sustainable manufacturing of these organic electronic devices because of the use of toxic solvents such as chloroform CF chlorobenzene CB and 12-dichlorobenzene DCB still pose serious health and environmental problems5  Therefore use of non-toxic materials will make organic photovoltaics as one of the cost effective and eco-friendly solar cell technologies for the future energy supply A real eco-friendly device needs to have photoactive materials that are not only design effective but also alcohol alcohol-or ultimately water processable By modifying the original hydrophobic side-chains to hydrophilic side-chains we are able to synthesize and fabricate the alcoholwater-soluble fullerene based OSCs6  However the study of morphology of polymer fullerene films made from green solvents is very limited Understanding and controlling the morphology of polymer films is important to optimize the performance of OSCs The differences in morphology obtained by using different solvents annealing and solvent additives can result in huge difference in device performance Highest efficiencies are achieved with optimized nanomorphology We have shown that morphological changes achieved by tuning the side chain of acceptor can result in a significant difference in ultrafast charge-generation and device-performance in all polymer solar cells The decyltetradecyl DT group of polymer acceptor was replaced by hexyldecyl HD group and the enhanced carrier lifetime and two times higher efficiency was observed in PTB7- Figure 1 AFM charge generation dynamics and device performance in PTB7-ThPNDIT-HD and PTB7-ThPNDIT-DT blends The scale bars of AFM images are 500 nm ThPNDIT-HD blend compared to PTB7-ThPNDIT-DT blend Figure 1 shows the impact of morphological variation in charge separation dynamics and device performance in all polymer solar cell devices based on these two blends  In the proposed work we plan to study morphology of polymer fullerene blends prepared from green solvents using neutron scattering Based on the feasibility study of polymer bulk heterojunction films and interaction with instrument scientists we plan to conduct Small Angle Neutron Scattering SANS in blended polymer films to characterize the phase separated morphology as SANS is less sensitive to the roughness of the sample10 1 The higher degree of phase-separation and interpenetrating network is desired in polymer blends for efficient charge transport and collection in vertical direction SANS measurement will be able to provide the mixing degree of donor and acceptors in the blends prepared from different solvents This information on intercalation of acceptor into donor phase will provide significant insights in charge transport and collection in OSCs In addition solution SANS will be employed to understand the aggregation behavior and the nanostructures in alcoholwater processed polymer solution The use of a water-ethanol co-solvent during processing can have critical influences on the film deposition and device performance Complementary studies including device performance transient absorption spectroscopy atomic force microscopy AFM and photoluminescence quenching will be performed to understand the morphological impact on charge generation and transport We will use PBDB-T PCBM blends prepared using chlorobenzene tetrahydrofuran and n-butanol to study the solvent effect on blend morphology We will prepare three homopolymer PPDT2FBT-A solution samples with different water alcohol content volume for the aggregation study Homopolymer solution samples will be prepared fresh at NCNR and experiment will be performed within the same day of preparation To enhance the contrast of polymers deuterated solvents will be used for solution preparation The chemical structure of PPDT2FBT-A PBDB-T and PCBM are shown below PCBM Proposed Experiments In order to have the similar morphology as in solar cell devices same spin coating condition will be used to prepare thin films for neutron scattering Two-inch diameter silicon wafer will be used to prepare the thin films As silicon is transparent to neutrons a stack of several wafers will be used as one sample to increase the signal to noise ratio The film thicknesses are  200 nm and we will stack 10-12 wafers for a total sample thickness on the order of few microns following established protocols 1 Our AFM images indicate that the domain sizes are on the order of 100 nm Therefore we will need to measure a q-range of 0003 -1  q  03 -1 We are requesting time on the VSANS instrument because we will be able to access the entire q-range with a single instrument configuration which will allow us to study a large number of samples more efficiently however these measurements could be performed on either of the 30 m SANS instruments if the VSANS is oversubscribed Measurement will be carried out at room temperature in ambient air condition We plan to measure a total of 15 samples 3 different polymer blend compositions x 3 solvents and 1 homopolymer solution x3 solvents x2 additives It will take approximately 15 h to measure the full q-range for each sample To complete this project we request that the beamline be available for us for 3 days Acknowledgements This work is supported by NSF in collaborating with the Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering CHRNS through award DMR 1827731  C Lee S
