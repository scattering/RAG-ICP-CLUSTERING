1 Dynamics of water in metal-ion intercalated graphene oxide Scientific Importance Graphene oxide GO has been suggested for low-energy consumption desalination and other water purification processes1 Because graphene oxide has the ability to keep metal ions between its layers2 it has also been suggested that atomically thick GO membranes can hold metal ions successfully and can thus be used as electrode material in supercapacitor and energy devices with improved performance3 Single layered graphene oxide can be deposited from various solutions into multilayered papers or membranes4 Being hydrophilic graphene confines water between its layers but also allows differential diffusion as we have found in our recent SNS experiment Figures 1  2 When water is confined on a nanometer scale it exhibits several unusual behaviors which include ordering viscoelasticity and long relaxation times5 The presence of ions further changes properties of water because ions influence ordering and interactions67 Metal ions intercalated in graphene oxide exhibit higher conductivity and higher optical transmittance3 The ion and water dynamics in metal-intercalated Mxene has been studied by neutron scattering8 However there are few studies of the ionwater dynamics in graphene oxide Different ions according to the Hofmeister series have different effects on ordering and dynamics of confined water7 An understanding of cationwater dynamics in graphene oxide is critical to improve the performance of these materials in purification and energy devices In particular we would like to study how the presence of four different cations structure former Na structure destroyer Cs intermediate ion K and a multivalent ion Ca will affect the interlayer and intra-layer diffusion of water in GO QENS is the best technique to measure this dynamics Preliminary work We recently completed experiments using BASIS at ORNL studying the differential diffusion of water  ethanol for low energy water purification applications as well as anisotropy interlayer and intralayer of diffusion Although there were issues with beam stability we were able to get significant results showing a strong differential between ethanol and water diffusion Figures 1  2 We are now ready to leverage our experimental expertise to study the effect of ions We have extensive experience in atomic force microscopy AFM studies of nanoconfined electrolytes in hydrophilic materials but not yet in GO67 From these studies we have found large qualitative differences of intercalating Na versus Cs While Na greatly enhances ordering Cs destroys it While Na leads to longer relaxation times Cs shortens them compared to purified water7 The combination of QENS and AFM will allow us to measure these electrolytes in GO membranes at different time scales for direct comparison of dynamics and viscosity while matching size composition and temperature conditions9 Preliminary analysis of our previous QENS measurements on water intercalated in graphene oxide allowed us to determine diffusion 2 coefficients using the jump diffusion model similar to pristine Mxene measured at BASIS The slower diffusion of ethanol explains the differential filtering ability of GO We are currently measuring these system in the AFM to see if the different diffusion behavior can be correlated with viscosity ordering and slow dynamic modes in these systems It is still an open question if the usual Einstein relation connecting diffusion and viscosity holds in highly confined systems and how this may be affected by structure-modifying contaminants such as ions We also observed straightforward temperature dependence of diffusion coefficient of water intercalated in pristine GO as shown in Figure 3 Choice of Instrument By combining the high resolution of HFBS and the higher dynamic range of DCS we hope to achieve the needed resolution to measure the dynamics of water from the supercooled to the normal state across a range of temperatures from 220K - 300 K QENS is the best choice to study microscopic diffusivity of the confined liquid in GO Experimental Plan We will study the inter- and intra-layer diffusion dynamics of water in GO intercalated with 100 mM NaCl KCl and CsCl as well as dry samples background measurement at 220K 233K 247K 260K HFBS and 275K 288K and 300K DCS The latter temperatures are chosen to match with temperatures that will be used in AFM The GO membranes with electrolyte will also need to be measured at baseline temperature at 4 K The number of required measurements include 4 temperatures including baseline at HFBS and 2 temperatures at DCS for 4 samples dry and three electrolytes as well as fixed window elastic scans for 3 samples at HFBS From our previous experience we expect to be able to complete the planned measurements at HFBS in 6 days at full beam power and at DCS in an additional 4 days The samples for HDBS and DCS will be prepared by intercalating with an electrolyte solution drying the samples rehydrating to a desired water content and checking the success of the intercalation using XRD3 at Wayne State University For AFM measurements we will confine the electrolytes between two GO sheets One sheet will be mounted on a sample substrate and the other on a flattened AFM tip We will then use the temperature-variable AFM to Figure 5 High sensitivity fiber-optic AFM for variable temperature measurements of nanoconfined liquids 3 create a varying width gap between the GO sheets immersed in the liquid at 275-300K We can control layer thicknesses within the pm range and continuously measure structure and dynamics both in normal and shear mode at sub-Angstrom cantilever amplitudes We are one of very few groups who can perform such precision viscoelastic measurements with AFM Data analysis and scientific outcomes We will follow standard data analysis for QENS as performed for our previous experiments to determine diffusion coefficients diffusion mechanisms activation barriers for diffusion and diffusion anisotropy For the AFM measurements Figure 5 we determine ordering mechanical relaxation times Figure 6 effective viscosity10 and associated energy barriers We will compare the obtained energy barriers for diffusion with those of viscosity obtained with AFM to see if they originate from the same underlying dynamics or if short- and long-time scale dynamics are decoupled Comparing diffusion viscosity anisotropy and ordering in the presence of different ions will allow us to determine the effect of lyotropic properties and ionic valence on the dynamics and structure of intercalated electrolytes giving us further insight into the efficacy of GO for purification and energy storage applications Safety Considerations We will strictly adhere to and follow the establish safety regulations for carrying out experiments on NCNR At Wayne State we will adhere to standard safety protocols for chemical laser and electrical safety References 1 H M Hegab and L Zhou Graphene oxide-assisted membranes Fabrication and potential applications in desalination and water purification J Membrane Sci 2015 484 95-106 2 J Loh K P Bao Q Eda G  Chhowalla M 2010 Graphene oxide as a chemically tunable platform for optical applications Nature Chemistry 212 1015-1024 3 J Wan F Gu W Bao J Dai F Shen W Luo X Han D Urban and L Hu Sodium-ion intercalated transparent conductors with printed reduced graphene oxide networks Nano Letters 15 63763-3769 2015 4 R R Nair H A Wu P N Jayaram I V Grigorieva and A K Geim Science 2012 335 442-444 5 SH Khan G Matei S Patil and PM Hoffmann Dynamic Solidification in Nanoconfined Water Films Phys Rev Lett 2010 105 106101 6 Shah H Khan Edward L Kramkowski and Peter M Hoffmann NaCl-Dependent Ordering and Dynamic Mechanical Response in Nanoconfined Water Langmuir 2016 32 42 10802-10807 7 S H Khan and P M Hoffmann Diverging Effects of NaCl and CsCl on the Mechanical Properties of Nanoconfined Water J of Electrochem Soc 2018 1653 H114-H120 8 NC Osti M Naguib A Ostadhossein Y Xie P R C Kent B Dyatkin G Rother W T Heller A C T van Duin Y Gogotsi and E Mamontov ACS Applied Materials  Interfaces 2016 8 8859-8863 9 M Neek-Amal FM Peeters I V Grigorieva and AK Geim ACS Nano 2016 10 3685 10 S H Khan E L Kramkowski P J Ochs D M Wilson and P M Hoffmann Viscosity of a nanoconfined liquid during compression Appl Phys Lett 2014 104 023110 Figure 6 Mechanical relaxation times of confined molecular layers in 1M NaCl squares 1M CsCl circles and pure water triangles at 08 nms compression rate Relaxation times increase due to restricted motion of molecules under confinement
