Interrelation between shear and ionic clusters can shear unlock ionic assemblies Background Ionizable polymers have been in the core of current and immerging technologies in which their capacity to transport ions and solvents is a key to their function These polymers are incorporated in critical technologies from the energy-water nexus to biotechnology where the interplay between dynamic processes within the polymer determine their transport and mechanical stability12 Their technological significance has driven an immense synthetic effort to tailor functionalities that enable transport while retaining chemical and mechanical stability The ionizable blocks often associate into clusters that often lock the polymer dynamics resulting in high glass transition temperatures that exclude melt processing1 As a result solution casting becomes the method of integrating structured ionic polymers into membranes In this process concentrated solutions are flowed over large areas while the solvents evaporate exposing the macromolecules to elongational flow The formation of ionic clusters in solutions often traps the system in a kinetically controlled state that affects the structure and properties of the membranes Here we will probe the relation between shear and the cohesion of ionic clusters in solutions of ionomers following the evolution of the signature of ionic assemblies in using SANS It is the method of choice since the ionic clusters exhibit a clear signature where the scattering length density differences allows clear distinctions between ionic and non-ionic segments within structured polymers The study will focus on one multi-functional polymer shown in Figure 1 Its melt structure attained by fully atomistic molecular dynamic MD simulations is shown in Figure 23 This polymer consists of an ionizable polystyrene sulfonate center block tethered symmetrically to polyethylene propylene terminated by t-butyl polystyrene3-6 This polymer was designed with the rational that the ionizable block will form transport channels and the hydrophobic blocks will enhance mechanical stability without crystallization We will refer to the polymer as the pentablock This polymer is chosen for this study because it exhibits well-defined features that corresponds to the ionic domains that is easily detected by SANS The signature of networks formed by swollen state of these membranes are clearly expressed in the low q regime Together with our previous SANS studies and further understanding attained by large scale molecular dynamic simulations this study will resolve the effects of shear on ionic clusters While shear and elongational flow exhibit different forces on the system the overall effects of shear will provide the first insight into the interrelation between flow fields and ionic clustering The proposed experiment will be carried out in concentrated cyclohexaneheptane solutions with a ratio of 11 wt similar to relevant industrial solvents Both solvents are commercially available in deuterated form The structure of the solutions will strongly depend on the nature of the solvent where in cyclohexane it is similar to that presented for the melt in figure 2 but with a significantly swollen hydrophobic regions56 In dilute and semi-dilute solutions Figure 1 The chemical structure of the pentablock including t-butyl styrene t-PS polyethylene propylene PEP and the polystyrene sulfonate PSS blocks The subscripts on the backbone correspond to polymerization numbers The polymer is provided by Kraton Polymer LLC Figure 2 a Snapshot of the pentablocks melt at 500K b PSS center block from the melt in a Blue represents the center PS orange the t-b-PS and green the PErP Oxygen atoms are red sulfur atoms are yellow and sodium atoms are gray3 isolated micelles with the ionizable blocks surrounded by the rest of the polymer SANS patterns are shown in Figure 3 dominate the structure In higher concentrations networks are formed with the ionic domains surrounded by the hydrophobic blocks In both regimes one would expect a multi-scale response where the PEP will be stretched in low shears and the response of the ionic assemblies will depend on their shape and cohesion Preliminary Work SANS studies of the dilute regime and MD simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed research and the potential response to shear The polymer was synthesized via anionic polymerization and the middle styrene block was selectively sulfonated The molecular weight of the unsulfonated blocks are 15-10-28-10-15 kgmol with a sulfonation fraction f  042 randomly sulfonated middle styrene block with a polydispersity of 101 for each block The solution structure of these pentablocks in a processing solvent of cyclohexaneheptane has been studied by X-ray4 and neutron scattering5 where X-ray scattering provided the general shape and neutron scattering have resolved a detailed insight essential for the proposed study SANS data in a 11 cyclohexaneheptane solution are shown in Figure 3 The low q regime is dominated by the scattering of the entire aggregate and the ionic domains where the high q provides an insight into the internal conformation of the different polymers Combined with MD simulations356 we were able to obtain a detailed insight into these core-shell assemblies that will serve as our reference point Computationally we have demonstrated that in melts all segments are affected by shear with the PE segment being the first to respond as shown in Figure 4 Solution studies that include a large number of solvent molecules are currently on the way Proposed Experiments Initially solutions of 1 Wt and 30 Wt of the polymer non-ionic f0 and with sulfonation fraction of f042 will be studied The protonated polymer will be dissolved in deuterated solvent that consists of a 11 mole of cyclohexane heptane At this sulfonation levels the polymer exhibits micelles at low sulfonation levels and a network in the high one SANS pattern will be measured at 25oC under different continuous shear rates and the structural response will be recorded The specific rates will be determined for each of the samples as the experiment evolves starting from a stationary state and increased up to the level where changes are expected to occur The experiment will begin with as low as possible share rates instrumentation limit and the rates will be increased This is our first experiment to follow the structure under shear using SANS Therefore some of the shear range will have to be determined as the experiment develops These systems are low viscosity fluids at the 1 Wt and are viscus liquids at 30 Wt The dilute sample is chosen to probe the micelle regime identifies experimentally and 1 Wt to probe well separated micelles below their interaction concentration The 30 Wt solutions will capture the networks regime The shear cell operates in continuous oscillatory Start-StopStartupStop modes with a torque of 01 Nm to 230 mNm with a time dependent capability for Rheo-SANS for any mode of operation The shape size and propagation of the ionic domains will be extracted as shear is applied Examples for information obtained by shear for soft matter can be found in ref 7 Figure 3 SANS profiles in terms of q2Iq vs q for the pentablock copolymer solution at concentration from 001 wt to 6 wt orange - 001 wt blue -0025 wt pink - 005wt cyan - 01 wt green - 05wt red - 1 wt violet - 2 wt yellow green - 4wt and navy blue - 6 wt at 25 C The symbols represent the experimental data and the solid lines represent the best fits5 Neutron Considerations The three different blocks exhibit sufficient contrast to give rise to well defined scattering patterns as our preliminary results have demonstrated The scattering length densities of the blocks are as follows 078x10-6 -2 for t-butyl styrene t-PS -0370x10-6 -2 for polyethylene propylene PE and 147 x10-6 -2 for polystyrene sulfonate PSS Deuterium-labeled solvents will be used to enhance contrast Data Analysis At room temperature at low concentrations we expect core-shell aggregates The micelle range will be analyzed using a core shell model that will change its shape as the concentration of propanol changes The higher concentration will be analyzed in terms of networks that may co-exists with micelles The rate of change in intensity along shear direction and perpendicular will then be correlated with macroscopic viscosity studies and results from MD simulations Beam Time Request We request 4 days This is our first experience with this system under shear We plan to run at two concentrations 4 samples for 4-5 shear rates The static measurements require about 2h to get the needed signal to noise for an in-depth analysis We will cover a large q range to capture the effects on both the entire shape of the aggregates and their internal structure Accounting for time change and temperature equilibration we request 4 days Summary Understanding shear effects on the conformation of structured polymers and that of their micelles formed will allow controlled design of membranes with controlled transport and
