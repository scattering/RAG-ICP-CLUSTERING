Investigation of the as-deposited interface between Si electrode and solid-state electrolytes LiPON under different material preparation steps and its correlation with electrochemical performances 1 Background and introduction Silicon Si has emerged as an alternative to the traditional anode electrode eg graphite in liquid electrolyte lithium ion batteries LiBs due to its ultrahigh theoretical capacity 4200 mAh g-1 Because of its capability to store 44 moles of Li per mole of Si many research studies have focused on the use of Si as an active anode material to enhance the overall energy density of commercial lithium LiBs  Even though many previous attempts have shown promising results in terms of capacity there are still many hurdles to overcome for it to be commercialized in LiBs One of the representative challenges impeding the practical use of Si is the huge volume change about 400  upon lithiationdelithiation This phenomenon results in the repetitive collapsereconstruction of solid electrolyte interphase SEI layer during cycles which accelerates the decomposition of liquid electrolyte increases the resistance of the cell and eventually causes the catastrophic capacity fading and safety issues eg thermal runaway in liquid electrolyte LiBs In order to address the above-mentioned problems of liquid electrolyte LiBs an approach of using solid-state electrolyte has been intensively studied during the past decades A solid-state electrolyte can provide fundamental solutions for many of the issues originated from liquid electrolytes such as flammability unstable formation of SEI layer and limited potential window Among solid-state electrolytes lithium phosphorous oxynitride LiPON has been significantly studied by many battery researchers over the past decades due to its negligible electronic conductivity decent ionic conductivity and stable potential window to 55 V There have been a few attempts to use LiPON as a solid-state electrolyte and lithium Li as an anode recently However a Li metal electrode paired with a solid-state electrolyte has critical issues with dendrite formation and poor interfacial adhesion in solid-state batteries These unwanted phenomena have discouraged researchers from directly using Li metal as an anode On the other hand a Si anode has less issues with Li dendrite growth and interfacial adhesion In addition Si can be easily deposited via sputtering onto any type of substrate as long as the substrate can endure the high vacuum These characteristics make it as an attractive electrode especially for thin film solid-state batteries Dr Meng has studied the interface between Si and LiPON before and shown that it forms an interface layer in between them  However the mechanism of how the interface layer forms and how it influences the electrochemical performance of solid-state batteries have not been studied yet The lack of knowledge about the interface becomes an impediment to the practical implementation of Si electrode in thin film solid state batteries In addition un-doped Si was mostly used as an anode for the preparation of thin film solid state batteries In this regard it is still very challenging to study what will happen at the interface and in the bulk of the electrode if n-type or p-type Si electrode is paired with amorphous LiPON electrolyte It is commonly known that the ionic and electronic conductivity of un-doped Si is lower than that of each n-type Si and p-type Si  It is likely that a different interface chemistry will form when thin film Si electrodes without and with doping P or B are physically contacted by LiPON due to possible corrosion reactions Furthermore this formed interface could affect the interfacial Kinetics and electrochemical reaction in solid-state batteries Up to now investigating the effect of doped Si has not been attempted in thin film solid state batteries Considering the nanoscale thickness of each layer and the significant role of Li participation in each layer neutron reflectometry NR would be the best method to provide the insight into nanometer-scaled structure and phenomena resulted from electrochemical reactions NR is one of the few methodologies which can analyze the structure and composition of each layer possessing light elements for example H and Li with nanometer resolution We believe that the lack of knowledge about the interface between LiPON and Si electrode can be filled by NR measurements and other complementary techniques XPS and XRR Results of this concept would enable us to understand the detailed structure and composition of interface layers and give a solid guideline to design thin film batteries with high electrochemical performances and stability 2Objectives In order to understand the influence of interface layer formed between Si electrode and LiPON on the electrochemical kinetics and unveil the mechanism of how Li diffuses over the interface it is crucial to look into the interface between Si electrode and LiPON and the bulk properties of Si electrode Herein we propose to apply neutron reflectometry to examine the structure of the formed interface layer between Si and LiPON Three Si electrodes with different doping will be employed for this study in order to see if the electronic conductivity of Si electrodes affects the structure of the interface layer and correlate these finding to the electrochemical kinetics of thin film solid-state batteries These findings would be meaningful to design appropriate electrodes for high performing thin film solid state batteries 3 Sample preparation and measurement A SiO2 layer will be thermally grown on RCA cleaned 5 mm Si wafers using the furnace at the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology CNST NIST in order to prevent the formation of platinum silicide during subsequent sputtering A 15 nm Pt layer as a current collector will be deposited onto a SiO2Si wafer Un-doped Si p-type Si and n-type Si layer with 18-20 nm thickness will be deposited onto the Pt-deposited SiO2Si wafer by magnetron sputtering followed by depositing 50-70 nm LiPON Figure 1 NR studies with a un-doped Si n-type Si and p-type Si electrodes After the analysis of intrinsic interface of each electrode with different dopant the prepared samples will be tested as a half-cell as shown in Figure 1b 4 Expected results and significance Preliminary tests using X-ray reflectivity XRR have been carried out to characterize the thickness RMS roughness and density of each prepared Si film According to the obtained results the thickness of each un-doped Si n-type Si and p-type Si is from 185 nm to 23 nm and RMS surface roughness of each sample is below 1 nm which is an optimum sample condition for XRR and NR As another preliminary test the sample of PtSiLiPONPt on SiO2Si wafer was prepared and measured by XRR to see the interface between LiPON and Si layer The XRR reflectivity and XRR SLD profile are translated into NR Figure 2 As shown in Figure 2c it is hard to see the interface between Si and LiPON due to the low X-ray contrast between Si and LiPON On the other hand throughout NR measurement we may be able to discern the interface area where Li Figure 2 a XRR Reflectivity curve and b expected NR Reflectivity curve from XRR of PtSiLiPONPt on SiO2Si substrate c XRR SLD profile and d expected NR SLD profile of PtSiLiPONPt on SiO2Si substrate Refl1D source of NCNR was used to fit the data to the model participates in any reaction The expected NR SLD profiles and corresponding reflectivity curves were given in Figure 3 As shown in Figure 3b NR reflectivity is highly affected by the SLD value of interface layer Moreover there is a possibility that the SLD value of Si layer near the interface might be smaller than the expected SLD value 1618 x 10-6A-2 of Si layer due to the Li incorporation into the Si In contrast the SLD value of LiPON near the interface might be larger than the expected SLD value 3426 x 10-6A-2 of LiPON due to the Li-depleted region of LiPON The above-expected results could be clearly unveiled by NR measurement This proposed experiment will set the stage for future studies on full-cells to check if external Li from Li metalor cathode is affecting the interface layer and other layers This study will enable additional battery research regarding thin film solid-state batteries and provide a guideline to design electrodes for practical solid-state batteries with high energy density Figure 3 a Expected NR SLD profiles and b corresponding NR reflectivity curves expected from the NR SLD profiles which are based upon our preliminary result Top Pt layer was deposited only for the XRR measurement For NR measurement top Pt layer will not be deposited onto the LiPON layer 5 Specific NR measurements First neutron reflectometry NR measurements will be performed with LiPON-deposited undoped Si n-type Si and p-type Si on SiO2Si substrates without bottom Pt layer to investigate the intrinsic structure of as-formed interface in between Si and LiPON These measurements will provide the clear structure of as-formed interface with high accuracy In the next step bottom Pt will be deposited prior to the SiLiPON deposition and these prepared samples will be tested by NR to check any possible reaction of Pt with each Si The above-mentioned six prepared samples are focused on the intrinsic structure of interface layer and each layer after the sample preparation In the following step prepared Si electrodes deposited with LiPON will be lithiated or delithiated in liquid electrolyte half-cell system as shown in Figure 1 to understand how Li diffusiontransport affects the chemistry and structure of each layer Three prepared Si electrodes will be dipped into the 1M LiPF6 ECDEC electrolyte and shallowly lithiated These lithiated samples will be rinsed in ethylene carbonate then measured by NR in a sealed He filled sample environment After the NR measurements with lithiated samples three lithiated samples will be delithiated and then examined by NR to observe any change in the interfaces and layers The obtained results will give clear evidences of how interface layer evolves in terms of electrochemical reaction and electrical property of doped Si or un-doped Si The running time of NR measurements will take 24 hours per one sample Considering the protocol it will require at least 12 days of beam time for this proposed study 6 References  CK Chan H Peng G Liu K McIlwrath XF Zhang RA Huggins Y Cui Nat Nanotechnol 3 2008 31  D
