Relaxation dynamics of polysorbate-20 in microemulsion systems for energy storage The effects of cosurfactant and the ferrocene redox couple Scientific Background and Aims of Proposed Experiments A grand challenge for 21st century power systems is fast utility-scale and energy-dense storage for more efficient and cheaper utilization of renewable energy such as wind and solar We are studying microemulsion systems as novel electrolytes for energy storage through a recently funded DOE Energy Frontiers Research Center project entitled Breakthrough Electrolytes for Energy Storage1 Microemulsions MEs are thermodynamically stable isotropic nanoscale dispersions of two immiscible liquids such as oil and water stabilized by a surfactant and cosurfactant MEs are an interesting class of electrolytes because they possess several properties that make them a promising energy storage medium - they are thermodynamically stable have fast dynamics possess large interfacial areas and can solubilize large concentrations of hydrophobic redox-active compounds in an aqueous base electrolyte solution The structures of the microemulsion nanophases are tunable by controlling the composition of the mixture temperature and salinity Preliminary Results Small angle neutron scattering on microemulsion and micelles with water loadings ranging from 90-20 indicate that the nanoscopic structure transitions from spherical droplets 90 water to a bicontinuous microemulsion 80-20 The spherical droplet structure was modeled with a Hayter-MSA structure factor which calculates the interparticle structure factor for a system of charged spheroidal objects in a dielectric medium23 This result is consistent with electrical conductivity measurements The cosurfactant chemistry and loading directly affects the interfacial fluidity and rigidity as demonstrated by our preliminary SANS data Fig 1 which also impacts charge transfer Cyclic voltammetry results show that the microemulsion systems Figure 1 the SANS results of micelles with and without butanol bulk contrast demonstrating that butanol decreases the quasiperiodic repeat distance via a shift of the scattering curve to higher q Figure 2 Cyclic voltammetry of a microemulsion exhibiting reversible behavior up to10 mVs to 22 Vs to be studied are reversible up to a very fast scan rate 22 Vs Fig 2 NMR diffusion and relaxometry experiments are in progress which will be used to support the NSE results Hypothesis This fast charge transfer is not easily explained but insight into the collective dynamics of the surfactants head group and the bending rigidity of the interface will provide a foundation to understand the proximity and transfer of ions across the oilwater interface Fig 3 One option is that the ferrocenium ion must cross the oilwater interface as it is not miscible in toluene In this picture the charge carried on the surfactants ethylene oxide head groups and the salt together balance the charge of the ferrocenium We believe ferrocenium must remain near the surfactant head groups because ferrocene is insoluble in water Alternatively the nitrate anion may migrate into the oil phase to balance the charge of the ferrocenium However nitrate is poorly soluble in toluene and the only stabilizing effect would be from the ferrocenium We therefore suspect that the first hypothesis is the most probable Moreover the crossing of ferrocenium over the oil-water interface will cause an observable change in the collective dynamics of the surfactants head group and the bending rigidity of the interface We propose neutron spin echo NSE experiments to monitor the interfacial bending rigidity that will offer a fundamental understanding of the changes in the surfactant local environment during the electrochemical reactions because the dynamics and bending rigidity are dependent on the interface environment NSE spectroscopy is one of the best suitable techniques to observe bending elasticity of surfactant membranes and have been widely employed to various microemulsion systems4-6 We have recently employed NSE to understand the impact of membrane-associated peptides on the bending modulus for bicontinuous microemulsions and therefore possess the expertise to successfully complete the proposed NSE measurements and analysis thereof4 Experimental Plan We propose to study the collective dynamics and bending rigidity of D2OPolysorbate-20KNO3 micelles without toluene and microemulsions with toluene with and without cosurfactant butanol and oxidation of ferrocene with NSE To ensure that there is not a large contribution from the structure factor of the systems we plan to study dilute systems at 1 surfactant loading We have a total of 8 samples 05-1 day each for the NSE measurements Therefore when also accounting for time required for instrument setup and measurement of standards 05 days we request a total of 7 days of NSE spectrometer beam time this will Figure 3 illustrates the polysorbate-20 molecule and the movement of the ferrocenium ion include time for temperature equilibration and sample changes Data will be normalized by SQtSQ0 and analyzed using Milner-Safran model to obtain the bending modulus NSE478 The change in bending modulus of the surfactant layer will be coupled to NMR studies and electrochemistry of the same samples to provide the needed information to elucidate the mechanism by which these promising electrolytes exhibit unusually fast charge transfer Proposed Sample List 1 Micelles  1 surfactant loading a D2OPolysorbate-20KNO3 b
