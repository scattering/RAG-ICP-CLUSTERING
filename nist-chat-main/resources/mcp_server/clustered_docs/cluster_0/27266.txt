Investigation of prelithiated thin film silicon electrode via neutron reflectometry 1 Background and introduction Silicon Si electrodes have gained significant interest from industry and academics during the past few decades due to their high theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh g-1 and large abundance Because of these fascinating features many research works have been carried out to make it commercially available and thus improve the energy density of commercial lithium ion batteries LiBs However several challenges associated with the electrochemical reaction mechanism of Si electrodes inhibit the practical use of Si in either liquid electrolyte-based LiBs or thin film solid-state batteries When a Si electrode storesreleases Li during chargingdischarging it causes a huge volume expansioncontraction about 400  which consequently leads to the poor interfacial stability In addition it consumes a lot of mobile Li originated from the cathode and the electrolyte resulting in a poor initial Coulombic efficiency and catastrophic capacity fading Among approaches to address these parasitic reactions the strategy of prelithiating Si electrode has been previously attempted 2  The conceptual approach has shown a significant improvement in initial Coulombic efficiency of 95  in comparison with typical Si electrodes 70-85  and proved that it can be paired with other Li-free counter electrodes Since commercially available anodes eg graphite and Si have no lithium source to deliver to the counter electrode cathode electrodes have been mostly restricted to lithium-contained compounds such as LiCoO2 LiFePO4 LiMnxNiyCoz etc In this regard the approach of introducing Li into anode electrodes eg Si electrode can not only broaden the option of countercathode electrodes but also improve the electrochemical reversibility of full-cells However the influence of prelithiation process on anode electrodes has not been well studied in terms of structure and chemical composition and no plausible evidence has been given to explain how prelithiated electrodes affect other battery components eg liquid electrolyte or solid-state electrolyte and how it is affected by ambient conditions The knowledge gap can be filled by analyzing the thin film Si electrodes before and after prelithiation using Neutron Reflectometry NR Results of measurements would enable us to understand the structure and composition of prelithiated Si electrode and lead to an improved manufacturing methods for thin film electrode-based batteries Moreover this concept can be further extended to other anode materials which are thermodynamically favorable to react with Li 2Objectives In order to understand the influence of prelithiation on anode electrodes eg Si and pre-diagnose the possible electrochemical reactions which occur at the interface it is crucial to study the bulk and interface of thin film Si electrode under a variety of prelithiation conditions Neutron reflectometry is one of the few techniques that can provide this needed interfacial characterization with nanometer resolution and can analyze the physical properties actual density porosity etc of thin film layers with accuracy Herein we propose to apply neutron reflectometry to characterize the bulk and interface structure of thin film Si electrodes in order to unveil the mechanisms of how Li diffuses through the thin film Si electrode and understand how it changes the structure and composition of each layer in the thin film batteries These findings would be very useful to prepare for predictable issues associated with capacity fading and to design appropriate electrodes compatible with solid-state electrolytes eg LiPO2N2 for thin film solid state batteries 3 Sample preparation A SiO2 layer will be thermally grown on RCA cleaned 5 mm Si wafers using furnace at the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology CNST NIST in order to prevent the formation of platinum silicide during subsequent sputtering A 15 nm Pt layer as a current collector will be deposited onto a SiO2Si wafer followed by depositing an 18 nm Si layer onto the Pt layer on SiO2Si wafer by magnetron sputtering Figure 1 shows the step of how to prepare a prelithiated Si electrode Before prelithiating the Si electrode a polypropylene separator Celgard 2500 sufficiently wetted with organic liquid electrolyte 1M LiPF6 ECDEC volume by volume will be placed in between the Si electrode and the Li metal foil The Li metal foil will be pressed against the separator using stainless steel foil to provide intimate contact between each layer Metal wires connected by each of stainless steel and Pt will be connected to potentiostat to precisely control the prelithiation of the Si electrode and measure the amount of passed charge to correlate with the amount of inserted Li determined by NR The degree of prelithiation will be controlled as a function of state of charge SOC which will be varied with each sample to provide a range of Li content After the prelithiation process the prelithiated Si electrode will be rinsed with enough ethylene carbonate EC to remove any electrolyte residue followed by being fully dried in the He-filled glove box To study the stability of a prelithiated Si electrode one sample of the prelithiated Si electrode will be placed in a He-filled glove box and exposed to the trace amount of oxygen  20 ppm for more than 2 days to naturally form a layer composed of Li2O Li2CO3 etc Figure 1 Sample preparation of prelithiated Si samples composed of a prelithiated Si layer a Pt layer and SiO2Si wafer for NR studies First step is to prepare the prelithiated Si electrodes with different SOC and second step is to leave the prelithiated Si electrode in the He-filled glove box for more than two days Each of samples will be tested with NR and XRR to study the structure of each layer 4 Expected results and significance As previously described thin film Si before and after prelithiation will be characterized by NR and supporting techniques such as XRD XPS XRR etc It is likely that a large amount of Li would react with the top part of Si layer for lower levels of lithiation and Li will go further toward the bottom of the Si layer adjacent to the Pt layer with increase of SOC We may be able to observe the changing density and thickness of the Si layer as a function of SOC due to Li incorporation into the Si layer Based upon this result we would be able to determine how prelithiation reaction affects the structure of the Si layer by comparing the SLD profiles of each sample Excessive prelithiation of Si electrodes may rather cause detrimental effects on the battery in terms of electrochemical and structural stability In this regard it is very crucial to gain an insight into the structure of Si electrodes at different SOC Preliminary tests have been carried out to check if the proposed concept works A small piece of Li metal strip was used to prelithiate the thin film Si electrode Figure 2a The color of the Si electrode in parallel with Li metal foil turned from purple which is original color of the prepared Si electrode to brown after 15 minute prelithiation Figure 2b Scanning electron microscopy SEM images were taken to look into the morphology of Si layer before and after prelithiation As shown in Figure 2c-d the surface of Si layer got rougher after the prelithiation indicating the volume change of Si layer For further structural characterization of our prepared samples X-ray reflectivity XRR measurements were conducted Figure 2e and 2g present the reflectivity curve of each sample as a function of Q showing the typical features of well-made thin films Refl1D resource of NCNR was used to fit the data to the model According to our analyzed results the SLD value of Si layer was decreased from 1582 x 10-6 to 104 x 10-6 and the thickness of Si layer was increased from 186 nm to 253 nm after 15 minute of prelithiation Figure 2f-h In addition RMS surface roughness of the Si layer increased from 401 to 1067  after the prelithiation due to the volume change of Si layer which is a typical phenomenon observed in previous reports However XRR is technically not the best instrument to analyze the fine structure of lithium-containing electrode due to the poor sensitivity of X-ray beam to light elements eg Li and H On the other hand through NR measurements we can study the interface and bulk structure of Si electrode where Li participates in electrochemical reactions and can diagnose the possible problems of prelithiated electrodes in advance This proposed experiment will set the stage for future studies on asymmetrical solid-state batteries which will be prepared by sequentially depositing LiPON as a solid-state electrolyte and Si as a counter electrode and tested as a full cell in order to demonstrate the practicability of prelithiated Si electrodes In these future experiments in-operando NR will be used to look into the interface layer in between prelithiated Si electrode and solid-state electrolyte eg Li2PO2N This study will enable additional battery research relevant to the prelithiation process in thin film solid-state batteries and eventually help to advance the development of practical solid-state batteries with high energy density Figure 2 Preliminary tests Photo images of a a Li metal strip used for prelithiation test and b Si electrode on PtSiO2Si substrate after prelithiation test Top-view SEM images of c bare Si electrode and d prelithiated Si electrode X-ray reflectivity curves of e bare Si electrode and g prelithiated Si electrode SLD profiles of f bare Si electrode and h prelithiated Si electrode 5 Specific NR measurements First neutron reflectometry NR measurements will be performed with a bare Si electrode SiPtSiO2Si wafer to investigate the original structure of each layer in the prepared sample The bare Si electrode will be dipped in liquid electrolyte rinsed with fresh EC solvent then measured by NR to check if there is a possible electrochemical reaction between liquid electrolyte and Si These two measurements will be compared to tell that the change of SLD profile only comes from the effect of prelithiation reaction Then NR measurement of prelithiated samples with different SOC for 20 40 60 80 100 and overcharged state will be carried out After these measurements one of the fully charged Si electrodes 100 SOC will be exposed to trace amount of oxygen  20 ppm in the glove box for two days It will form a thin layer of Li2O outside the surface of lithiated Si which is reported to have an effect on passivating the prelithiated Si Through NR measurements the structure and composition of resulting layers eg Li2CO3 and Li2O will be unveiled which will give an insight into the formation mechanism of lithium containing byproducts For the accurate and conclusive analysis of NR measurements the result will be complemented by XRR as well as neutron depth profile NDP which can provide rough information of Li distribution over the entire layers The running time of NR measurements will take 24 hours per one sample Considering the protocol it will require at least 9 days of beam time for this proposed study 6 References  CK Chan H Peng G Liu K McIlwrath XF Zhang RA Huggins Y Cui Nat Nanotechnol 3 2008 31
