NCNR-IMS Proposal 27466 - Neutron imaging of fuel injectors Scientific Importance Fuel injector design in modern diesel-based compression ignition CI engines and recently developed gasoline direct injection GDI engines can have a dramatic impact on both combustion efficiency and emissions The external spray dynamics after the spray exits the injector nozzles have been extensively studied using visible light IR and x-ray techniques  but these approaches do not easily allow flow visualization inside the dense metallic end-use injectors Modelers need better visualization and quantitative measurement of fluid dynamics occurring inside the injectors as this impacts the exiting spray 2- The unique capability of neutrons to penetrate the metal body of fuel injectors while being sensitive to the hydrogenous fuel contained within can enable the connection of the internal and external flows to more fully describe the physics of the spray Recent improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of neutron imaging will aid in the dynamic reconstruction of the fuel injection event This improved understanding is increasingly critical for guiding predictive models that can be used to design engines that meet both efficiency and emissions targets while remaining economically viable Through the engine combustion network ECN these measurements will be fed back to computational tools used to understand the physical processes in and out of the injector Previous Work Our work to date with neutron imaging of fuel injectors has focused on reactor-based polychromatic neutrons at the HFIR CG-1D Imaging beamline to perform computed tomography CT for the extraction of geometric information  and high-speed time-resolved ensemble imaging to capture and quantify mechanical and fluid dynamics within injectors at up to 5 s time resolution with examples shown in in Figure 1 Figure 1 a Sectioned volumetric rendering from a neutron CT of a gasoline direct injector shows the internal components b Various filtering and normalization methods applied to a frame from time-resolved imaging of the same injector shows the ability to resolve the movement of the injector valve needle Rows correspond to filtering method while columns correspond to normalization method The injector body outline has been overlaid on the normalized images for clarity NCNR-IMS Proposal 27466 - Neutron imaging of fuel injectors Despite advances that have been made in terms of quantitative analysis of the dynamics of internal mechanical components investigations into fluid dynamics such as cavitation in the injector spray nozzles has been limited by the spatial resolution of the available neutron imaging detectors These spray nozzles the Hole shown in Figure 1a are typically 100-200 m in diameter Resolving fluid dynamics in such a small channel has proven impractical with the detectors available at HFIR which have resolution on the order of 50-100 m depending on the setup We intend to demonstrate the feasibility of such measurements with the higher-resolution imaging systems available at NCNR Choice of instrument The Neutron Imaging Facility NIF at NCNR has been at the forefront in pushing the limits of spatial resolution with neutron imaging With capabilities in the range of 1-20 m depending on setup the facilities at NIF should enable direct visualization of cavitation and flash boiling in injector nozzles Experiment Plan There are two experimental elements to this proposal The first is to perform a neutron CT scan on the nozzle region of a fuel injector to determine the resolution to which certain geometric features of interest may be determined These results will be compared with high-resolution synchrotron x-ray CT of the same device  The CT scan is expected to require approximately 1 day of beamtime The second element is to perform dynamic or time-resolved ensemble neutron imaging of a cyclically repeating injection and spray event This will be performed at the same conditions as previous efforts at HFIR to enable direct comparison of resolvable dynamics We expect that 3 days will be required to gather adequate time-resolved statistics for a single operating condition Over the course of several years of experiments at HFIR related to fuel injectors and sprays we have developed a portable and robust sample environment and supporting equipment Figure 3 to enable continuous and uninterrupted operation of an automotive gasoline injector for periods exceeding a week Figure 2 a Model of a fuel injection sample environment in which the entire injector can be exposed to the neutron beam allowing dynamic imaging to be performed on all internal components b Sample environment installed at the CG-1D imaging beamline at the High Flux Isotope Reactor HFIR NCNR-IMS Proposal 27466 - Neutron imaging of fuel injectors Safety Considerations These experiments will use iso-octane a flammable and combustible liquid which is a universally employed fuel surrogate for research on gasoline sprays The iso-octane will be pressurized to 200 bar and heated to 90 C before being injected in the spray chamber The spray chamber will be continuously purged by inert argon or nitrogen sweep gas This sweep gas performs two functions providing a temperature- and pressure-controlled downstream environment for the spray and removing the sprayed liquid from the chamber and preventing accumulation While the chamber is designed for continuous operation up to 300 C sweep gas temperature from vacuum to 690 kPa abs we will be focusing on much more modest conditions of 60 C at 50-100 kPa abs for these experiments There are multiple engineering controls to ensure safety during the experiments The spray chamber and all other pressure systems have been designed and approved for the operating pressures and temperatures the fuel system is interlocked with various components of the system to ensure that fuel is only injected when all elements of the system are properly functioning Due to hard limits placed on total fuel volumes in our prior experiments at HFIR the system has been developed so that the fuel is contained in a closed system with a pump and inert sweep gas accumulated fluid will be collected and recirculated back to the fuel sytem Only the spray chamber fuel injector and the first 10 cm of the spray will be in the neutron beam see yellow box in Figure 3a All equipment will have NCNR approval prior to operation References 1 Fansler Todd D and Scott E Parrish Spray measurement technology a review Measurement Science and Technology261 2014 012002 2 Kolakaluri Ravi Shankar Subramaniam and Mahesh V Panchagnula Trends in multiphase modeling and simulation of sprays International Journal of Spray and Combustion Dynamics 64 2014 317-356 3 Saha Kaushik et al Numerical investigation of two-phase flow evolution of in-and near-nozzle regions of a gasoline direct injection engine during needle transients SAE International Journal of Engines 92 2016 1230-1240 4 Baldwin Eli T et al String flash-boiling in gasoline direct injection simulations with transient needle motion International Journal of Multiphase Flow 87 2016 90-101 5 Battistoni M Xue Q Som S and Pomraning E Effect of Off-Axis Needle Motion on Internal Nozzle and Near Exit Flow in a Multi-Hole Diesel Injector SAE Int J Fuels Lubr 71167-182 2014 httpsdoiorg1042712014-01-1426 6 Powell C F et al The effects of diesel injector needle motion on spray structure Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power 1331 2011 012802 7 Duke D Finney C Kastengren A Matusik K et al High-Resolution X-Ray and Neutron Computed Tomography of an Engine Combustion Network Spray G Gasoline Injector SAE Int J Fuels Lubr 102328-343 2017 httpsdoiorg1042712017-01-0824
