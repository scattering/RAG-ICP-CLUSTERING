Huitink VSANS 11142019 1 Objective This effort seeks to observe the solid-liquid phase change phenomena that occurs in nanoparticle-enhanced sorbitol composites using very-small-angle neutron scattering VSANS Based on prior XRD evaluations the intent is to characterize the nanoscale ordering along the nanoparticle inclusions gold and iron oxide along with their cascaded particle interactions that develop the microstructural changes that govern thermal properties within the solid Additionally temperature-controlled active melting and solidification experiments will help to elucidate the presence and formationdissolution of crystalline phases in the nanocomposites which alters latent heat exchange as well as melting temperature We wish to couple this study with a complementary ultra-small-angle neutron scattering USANS analysis which we have requested in a separate proposal 2 BackgroundContext With the ubiquitous integration of concepts such as electric vehicles and solar power arrays in modern day life the realm of power electronics has been one of significant popularity in the scientific community Advancements in everything from device reliability1 to vehicle-to-grid systems2 are needed to keep up with the publics demand for the new technology however perhaps one of the most pivotal design challenges continues to be thermal management As devices increase in power density the thermal energy produced by their operation increases exponentially and previous methods of dissipating the thermal load will soon be inadequate Among the novel emerging suggestions for thermal management of high-voltage devices has been to use phase change materials PCMs3 Common PCMs include paraffin wax and sugar alcohols such as sorbitol Whereas conventional heat exchangers dissipate heat to the surroundings normally through a combination of convection andor conduction PCMs absorb the heat through latent heat exchange or the thermal energy absorbed when the PCM melts When they are used in conjunction with another type of heat exchanger such as a simple aluminum heat sink PCMs work exceptionally well as a transient thermal management system where the thermal peaks during heavy device usage are mitigated In order to further maximize the latent heat exchange and reliabilty of the PCMs a few research efforts have worked towards developing nano-enhanced PCMs where a nanomaterial is integrated directly into the bulk PCM4 Recent efforts by the Huitink group have investigated the structural effects of the addition of gold nanoparticles NPs in bulk sorbitol5 Results highlighted in Figure 1 display selected XRD scans of nano-enhanced sorbitol composites at different gold NP concentrations As the presence of gold NPs increases in the sorbitol matrix the intensity of the sorbitol solid melt phase 402  decreases while the intensity of the polymorphic beta phase 45  increases which has shown to alter the mechanical and morphological properties of sorbitol6 Sorbitol inoculated with gold NPs also observed noticeable increases in total latent heat exchange Previous measurements gathered with NG3 VSANS at the NCNR compared regular and NP-enhanced sorbitol Figure 2 Reduced VSANS data of gold-NP enhanced sorbitol structures Figure 1 XRD results highlighting how NP molarity influences polymorphic phase formation in sorbitol Huitink VSANS 11142019 Figure 2 the difference between the reduced datasets indicates the presence of nano-scale structures forming in the high-Q regime By noting rising intensity in the low-Q regime it is apparent that the data needs to be extended across the entire Q-Range to observe changes in sorbitol micro and nanostructure which can be accomplished through coupling VSANS with USANS 3 Scope of proposed work We propose to use the NG3 VSANS instrument at the NCNR to analyze the nano and microstructure of nano-enhanced sorbitol PCMs in situ during melting and solidification With previous VSANS work we were able to observe formations on the nanoscale within the solidified sorbitol PCM We wish to take advantage of the broad real-space measurement range 1 nm - 2000 nm of VSANS to analyze structural changes on the micro and nanoscales We plan to synthesize sorbitol samples integrated with gold and iron oxide spherical NPs observe sorbitol beta phase formation of the NP-inoculated samples during sample solidification as well as show how the structure of the phase changes during melting An interpretation of the beta phase structure within the nano-enhanced PCM will be used in conjunction with existing thermal measurements to aid in optimizing the PCMs for integration into power electronics systems In conjunction with this proposal we have also submitted an additional proposal to use USANS which will aid in resolving some of the larger structures formed during melting and solidification 4 Experimental Details 41 Samples and Trials The measured samples will consist of solid sorbitol with evenly distributed NPs throughout the entire sample volume shown in the table below Each type of NP will be fabricated by the Huitink Lab and integrated into the sorbitol matrix through a well-established procedure The concentrations of each NP will be varied within the range shown in the table Sample Type Particle Concentration M Temperature Range Tested C Sorbitol Control 1E-9 - 1E-3 25-100 Gold NPs in Sorbitol 1E-9 - 1E-3 25-100 Iron Oxide Fe3O4 NPs in Sorbitol 1E-9 - 1E-3 25-100 After an initial solid-state measurement of each sorbitol sample at room temperature an integrated heater will gradually increase the local temperature of the samples at 25C intervals a VSANS measurement across the Q range will occur at each interval to observe changes in phase After the sample is melted the temperature will then be reduced by increments of 25C to observe solidification 42 Setup and facilities For simplicity we will utilize the standard 610 Position HeatingCooling Sample Block to house the PCM samples To modulate temperature the sample block will be heatedcooled with a Julabo or Huber circulating bath with silicon oil this can achieve the temperature range of 25 - 100C needed for melting The desired Q-range we wish to measure with VSANS for this study is 00002 - 10 -1 Facility RequestsRequirements o Standard 610 Position HeatingCooling Sample Block o Julabo or Huber circulating bath with silicon oil Huitink VSANS 11142019 43 Run Time Needs 4 days of beam time VSANS Observing structure of nano-enhanced sorbitol composites during melting an solidification 3 sample types x 7 temperature steps per type x 3-4 hours per temperature measurement at different detector positions 4m -
