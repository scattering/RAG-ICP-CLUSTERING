Leveraging block polymerhomopolymer blends to tune lithium salt and monomer segment distributions in lithium-ion battery electrolytes Priyanka M Ketkar Thomas H Epps III Introduction and Motivation Nanostructured block polymer BP electrolytes are promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries because the properties that contribute to the performance and safety of these electrolytes can be decoupled and simultaneously optimized For example polystyrene-block-polyethylene oxide PS-b-PEO and polystyrene-block-polyoligo-oxyethylene methacrylate PS-b-POEM electrolytes enable ion conductivity through the PEO and POEM domains and the PS domains maintain mechanical integrity However current BP electrolytes have significantly lower ionic conductivities than liquid-state electrolytes and the BP conductivity becomes especially poor near the PS-PEO or PS-POEM domain interfaces The modification of polymer and ion distributions with respect to these interfaces can allow lithium-ion transport to be enhanced The proposed study investigates the monomer segment and salt distributions in BPhomopolymer HP blend electrolytes to understand how these distributions affect lithium-ion transport A variety of methods have been studied in previous work to tune the distributions of monomer segments and lithium salts in BP electrolytes Monomer segment distributions have been tuned in PS-b-POEM electrolytes through the synthesis of gradient copolymer regions at the chemical junction between the PS and POEM blocks ie tapered block polymers3 and through the blending of POEM HPs into PS-b-POEM BPs5 Notably in the latter method blends containing HPs with a molecular weight Mn that was equal to or greater than the Mn of the POEM block in the BP resulted in a dry brush structure in which the HPs segregated toward the center of the POEM domains in contrast a wet brush structure contains a more even distribution of low-Mn HPs5 The dry brush structure enhanced ion solvation and improved ionic conductivity in comparison to the equivalent unblended or blended wet brush electrolytes in spite of the fact that the dry brush electrolyte had the lowest lithium and polymer mobilities5 Lithium salt distributions have been tuned in PS-b-PEO electrolytes by varying the segregation strength1 Gomez et al demonstrated that by increasing the molecular weight of PS-b-PEO ie increasing the segregation strength the ions in lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide LiTFSI became increasingly concentrated toward the center of the PEO domains Fig 1a1 Interestingly this localization was not exhibited in PS-b-POEM electrolytes Fig 1b and 1c2 4 5 suggesting that the architectural differences between PEO and POEM influence the salt solvation behavior Several avenues exist for further development in BP electrolytes The dry brush electrolyte is a promising and facile alternative to the unblended BP and the incorporation of mixed PEO and POEM domains may allow salt distributions to be tuned efficiently and separately from the monomer distributions Among the questions that will be addressed in this study are the following 1 How are the monomer segment distributions at the PS-POEM or PS-PEO interfaces influenced by the architecture of the conductive polymer 2 How does architecture of the conductive polymer both in the BP and the HP affect HP distributions and lithium salt distributions in a dry brush electrolyte 3 How does the Mn of the HP affect the HP and ion distributions in the conductive domains and the PS-PEO or PS-POEM interface All HP Mns were selected to form dry brush structures but the extent of HP localization may be affected by the HP Mn 4 How does the lithium salt chemistry ie anion species affect the distribution of the HP and lithium salts in the dry brush electrolyte We propose to explore these questions via contrast variation neutron reflectometry NR studies at the NIST Center for Neutron Research as part of the University of Delaware UD Center for Neutron Science collaboration To measure the HP distributions within the conducting domain we consider ternary polymeric dry brush systems that contain PS deuterated POEM dPOEM and PEO One system contains PS-b-dPOEM BPs blended with PEO HPs and the other system contains PS-b-PEO BPs blended with dPOEM HPs The contrast between dPOEM and PEO allows us to distinguish the conductive components of the BP from the HP By doping equivalent non-deuterated polymer blends with lithium salts we can leverage the inherent contrast matching condition between the PS domains and the salt-doped PEO and POEM domains to determine salt distributions The neutron scattering length densities SLDs of the proposed materials are listed in Fig 2 and predicted SLD and reflectivity profiles of selected samples are depicted in Fig 3 Both the HP and salt distributions cannot be determined with X-ray reflectivity in these proposed systems To supplement the findings in these NR experiments small angle X-ray scattering differential scanning calorimetry and AC impedance spectroscopy measurements will be conducted at UD to connect the polymer and salt distributions to the bulk morphology chain mobility and ionic conductivity of the proposed electrolytes Materials and Methods The BPs in this sample set include PS-b-PEO PS-b-dPOEM and PS-b-POEM Mn  34000 gmol and volume fraction of PEO dPOEM or POEM is 04 for all BPs The HPs that are to be blended with the BPs are PEO POEM and dPOEM of varying molecular weights Mn  20000 gmol and 31500 gmol for all HPs and number of monomer repeat units are adjusted to Figure 1 a LiTFSI-doped PS-b-PEO measured by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy1 The red blue and grey regions

and lithium perchlorate LiClO4 The salts will be added to the polymer systems at concentrations of ELi  111 51 and 41 respectively to achieve contrast matching conditions Collectively these experiments require 19 total samples All systems will be cast onto bare silicon substrates to form parallel lamellae as done in previous work2 4 NR measurements enable the determination of the through-film composition profile These experiments do not require special sample environments and each sample can be run in 8 hours As a result we request 7 days of beam time The NR data will be fit to multilayer models that include PS dPOEM or salt-doped POEM and salt-doped PEO layers using the refl1D software6 References 1 E D Gomez A Panday E H Feng V Chen G M Stone A M Minor C Kisielowski K H
