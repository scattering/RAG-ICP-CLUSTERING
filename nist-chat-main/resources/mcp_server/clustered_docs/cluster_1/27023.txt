 PI Hackett John CBackground and Anticipated Impact The cytochromes P450 CYPs are responsible for a dazzling array of transformations in the disposition of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds1 Over 70 of drugs are metabolized by CYPs2 3 hence tremendous resources are devoted to identification of substrates and inhibitors in drug development to avoid later attrition or adverse drug interactions following introduction into the clinic4 5 Those involved in steroid hormone biosyntheses are among the key targets for the pharmacotherapy of endocrine disorders and cancers6-8This proposal focuses on two human CYPs CYP3A4 3A4 and CYP19A119A1 3A4 is highly promiscuous as 50 of drugs are metabolized by this enzyme9 19A1 is responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens one of the most primordial human CYPs and is the most widely targeted human CYP by pharmacotherapy primarily for breast and gynecological cancers6 10 11 Human CYPs are predominately associated with the membrane providing a reservoir for substrates a medium for interaction with redox partners and an interface that presumably tunes the function of the catalytic domain The impact of the membrane on protein dynamics ligand recognition and catalysis represents a significant gap in knowledge in the CYP field In the proposed experiments we have adopted nanodiscs NDs as models to study the topology of these CYPs in lipid bilayers NDs are a spatially-delineated patch of lipid bilayer circumscribed by amphipathic scaffold proteins that provide a native-like microcosm for membrane proteins12 13 They are powerful tools for SAXS and SANS experiments because they permit precise control of lipid composition as well as being soluble and generally mono-disperse The goal of integrating SANS into our research program is to understand how variations in lipid composition modulates orientation and penetration depth of the catalytic domain into membranes The goal of this beam-time request is to perform SANS studies to determine the orientation insertion depth and overall architecture of 3A4 and 19A1 NDs Both enzymes are expected to harvest their substrates directly from the membrane accordingly their bilayer topology is of great mechanistic interest SANS will illuminate the juxtaposition of probable substrate ingress channels with the membrane surface thereby providing insight into the mechanisms of substrate recruitment These studies will also refine tools necessary to validate myriad molecular dynamics simulations of CYPs in membranes that have recently appeared in the literature14-17 SANS is a convenient technique that can inform on the solution structure of NDs with sufficient resolution to meet our goal of delineating CYP membrane topology In general SANS provides structural information about the lipid bilayer as well as information about the interplay between the lipids and the membrane protein information that is neither available from cryo-EM due to the low electron density of the lipids or from NMR where lipids are deuterated to suppress their signal18 19 SANS with contrast variation uniquely provides both the spatial organization and structural features of the lipid and protein components of ND systems It is this feature of SANS that makes it uniquely powerful for interrogating the structures multicomponent biological assemblies20 Preliminary Data We have performed proof-of principle studies showcasing the full pipeline from sample preparation SAXSSANS measurements and structural modeling with empty 3A4- and 19A1-NDs with mixed bilayers composed of 11 POPCPOPG SAXS measurements were made by high-throughput SAXS at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory LBNL SANS measurements were made during our October 2019 visit to the NGB30 SANS instrument at the NIST Center for Neutron Research SANS of empty NDs were performed in 100 D2O buffer as well as 42 D2O buffer to contrast match the MSP1D1- belt It is evident in the representative SAXS and SANS data Fig 1 that the samples scatter strongly and produce high-quality data at concentrations between 6-20 M even in 42 D2O Fig 1A blue where high incoherent scattering of H2O contributes substantial background In empty NDs SANS and SAXS data fit remarkably well to and justify the use of a simple geometric description to describe the structure of the ND component in our modeling approach Fig 1A inset Reconstruction of the ND structure revealed a highly elliptical ND ellipticity f045 Pure POPC NDs are less elliptical f02821 so the change in ND structure is entirely attributable to the incorporation of anionic POPG 100 D2O SANS and SAXS for 3A4 and 19A1-NDs were likewise globally fit to structures Fig 1B only 19A1 data and analyses shown Unfortunately 3A4- and 19A1-NDs were more sensitive to an unintended freeze-thaw en route to NIST and subsequent manipulations at NGB30 SANS The result was loss of the 42 samples and formation of some high Page of 1 3Fig 1

upturn in the low-q region of the SANS data Evidence of such aggregates have not been present in SAXS data so it is possible to produce mono-disperse samples for SANS with minor adjustments in sample preparation see Experimental Details Nevertheless we were able to extract structural information from global fitting Fig 1B inset Preliminary analyses support that 19A1 incorporation decreases ND ellipticity f031 thins the bilayer with the protein 40  off-center Based on the preliminary studies and with modifications to sample preparation we are confident that this approach will meet our goals Choice of Instrument We are requesting three days of access to the CHRNS NGB30 30m SANS instrument to cover a Q-range 0004-05-1 Experimental Details 19A1 in pure POPC 3A4 in POPCPOPG NDs and empty NDs of both lipid compositions will be prepared in the Hackett laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University 126 mi from NIST CHRNS Recent SEC-SAXS data support that the pure POPC 19A1 NDs are more stable than those with mixed lipid composition so we have elected to prioritize their characterization by SANS In addition to buffer blanks we will collect 14 and 70 D2O contrasts for POPGPOPC empty NDs as well as a complete set of D2O contrasts 14 42 70 and 100 for empty POPC NDs Based on our previous experience empty NDs are very robust and produce excellent quality data out of the box and should be complete in less than one day of beam time The remaining two or more days of the requested beam time will dedicated to collecting a complete set of contrasts for 19A1 and 3A4 NDs Also based on our previous experience we expect the 100 70 and 42 contrasts to complete in 15 days Remaining beam time will be dedicated to the 14 contrast that will require extended data collection times due to the large incoherent scattering from H2O To minimize manipulations at NGB30 SANS separate CYP ND samples will be subject to size-exclusion chromatography in 100 D2O and 100 H2O buffers in the Hackett lab and the samples combined at NIST to achieve the desired contrast SEC-SAXS data show that aggregates formed during transport are well-separated from the mono-disperse ND peak and are of sufficient size to be removed with a 022 m filter immediately before data collection The power of SANS stems from the ability to manipulate the neutron contrast the difference between the scattering length densities of sample components and the solvent by varying the solvent HD concentration All particle components are visible in 100 D2O buffers however adjusting the D2O to 42 provides a background matching the protein contrast yielding only the bilayer scattering profile Contrasts above 70 and below 14 the protein match point will be added to increase the number of parameters that can be fitted and the rigor of the resulting structural models Data reduction and buffer subtraction will be performed using the NIST Center for Neutron Research SANS Reduction protocols and model-independent analyses Rg Dmax done with Sctter3 Anticipated Data Analysis Methods Small-angle scattering from a dilute solution of mono-disperse particles with negligible inter-particle interactions depends on its form factor which describes the intra-particle interference of scattered X-rays or neutrons22 The scattering behavior of empty NDs are readily described using the analytical form factors for a collection of elliptical cylinders representing the ND components lipid terminal methyl groups lipid tails head groups and MSP1D1- protein belt having different scattering lengths and partial specific volumes21 23With molecular restraints based on knowledge about the ND system ie approximate number of lipids MSP1D1- belt height and length fitting the combined scattering amplitudes to these remarkably simple shapes to experimental data has provided detailed structural information for empty NDs21 Furthermore this approach can be combined with bead-based modeling one amino acid  one bead of the membrane protein to fit a structural model of the entire complex using the SAXS and SANS data24Fig 1B inset Fitting parameters include but are not limited to the ratio of the long and short axes of the elliptical ND area per lipid head group number of lipids hydration waters per head group height of the membrane height of the MSP1D1- belt and the position of the membrane protein Combining these with the structure of the protein yields a three-dimensional model of the complete ND system Global fitting will be performed using the WillItFit software25 Parameters in turn will be used to construct models for visualization with our custom MATLAB code CYP structures from the MD simulations will be used to generate the initial bead models for fitting CYPs in simulations are identical to that used in the experiments and pre-adapted to the membrane environment whereas the available crystal structures maintain artifacts from lattice packing and the transmembrane domains are missing Safety Considerations The NDs in the proposed experiments will be prepared in 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 74 with 100 mM NaCl 05 mM EDTA 05 mM TCEP and varying concentrations of D2O as described above POPC and POPG are from Avanti Polar Lipids and the proteins are expressed in E coli and purified in the Hackett laboratory None of the samples are biohazardous or of human origin contain radioactive isotopes or require special handling precautions References 1 Ortiz de Montellano PR Cytochrome P450  structure mechanism and biochemistry New York Kluwer AcademicPlenum Publishers 2005 2
