Introduction and state of scienceSemiconductor nanowires are increasingly used in life science as nanometre probes and to manipulate living cells When interfacing high aspect ratio nanowires with cells the first point of contact is the cell membrane which forms a locally highly curved membrane around the nanowires  The mechanisms of the formation of this bilayer are not fully understood We have previously demonstrated the formation of a phospholipid bilayer on gallium phosphide GaP nanowires via vesicle fusion Based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching FRAP measurement the phospholipid bilayers were found to follow the contours of the nanowires as continuous and fluid locally curved bilayers  However that data did not reveal the coverage composition and the dimensions of the bilayer The proposed experiment aims to investigate this in detail by using Grazing Incidence SANS GISANSCurved cell membranes are important for the function of the cell both for compartmentalization in organelles within the cell and for cellular mitosis It has also been shown that the curvature of a lipid membrane can affect the concentration of membrane bound proteins particularly as regards separation between the inner and outer parts of the curved surface The phospholipid covered nanowires function as a curved model membrane and so can be used to study how the curvature affects a cell membrane and membrane bound proteins Results will be compared to previous and ongoing studies of flat interfaces using reflectometryPrevious resultsWe recently finished two GISANS experiments on phospholipid covered nanowires one at the VSANS beam line at NIST and on at the SANS2D beam line at ISIS In these two experiments we have used a lipid mixture consisting of DOPC with 20 DOPE covering Si nanowires in a single bilayer The GISANS experiment at VSANS fig 1 and at SANS2D have shown that we can resolve the nanowires and the lipid bilayer Figure 1 shows example data from VSANS in contrast matched Si ie 38 D2O and 62 H2O The scattering is focused in the minus q-range due to the set-up of the cell This set-up caused the neutron to scatter on the left detector panel which in this case is defined as the negative side Analysis of the data is ongoingFigure 1 GISANS data from VSANS Cut along Qx  0 Blue line is the bare nanowires in contrast matched Si and the green line is nanowires covered in a phospholipid bilayerAims and proposed experimentIn this study we propose to continue investigation of the previous mentioned system the phospholipid covered nanowires In this planned experiment we will study the curvature induced phase separation of a three-component lipid system consisting of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine DOPC brain spinghomyelin bSM and cholesterol chol at the molar ratio 331  The lipid composition of DOPC-bSM-Chol has a coexistence of the Ld and Lo phase below the Tm which forthe ratio of 331 occurs at 42C This is illustrated to the right in figure 2 At 20 C the Ld phase is mostly present at the top of the NWs while the Lo phase is preferably present at the bottom of the NWs which is less curved The DOPC component of this mixture will be deuterated to effectively study the phase separation Deuterated DOPC will be requested from the ISIS deuteration facility With the help of neutrons and different contrast we aim to reveal the coverage and structure of this phase separationFigure 2 Left Si nanowires in a hexagonal array The nanowires are 85 nm in diameter 800 nm long and spaced 500 nm apart Scale bare in 1 m Right 3D reconstruction

surface area of 41 m x 41 m at 20C Confocal image from We request time on VSANS or if unavailable NGB30m SANS to perform GISANS on our Si nanowire array fig 2 left Each sample will consist of Si nanowires in a hexagonal pattern on a 65 mm  65 mm  625 mm Si crystal fig 2 left covered with a phospholipid bilayer The area of the Si blocks ie 65  65 mm2 will allow us to take advantage of the tall beam of the VSANS instrument and will make an more efficient use of the beam time We will characterise the nanowire array in D2O After the characterisation of the substrate we will deposit the bilayers via vesicle fusion To make the full programme of measurements we require five days of beam time as the GISANS signal is weak One day is needed for alignment two days for measurements in different solvent contrasts and the last two days will be spent on measuring the bilayer These measurements will allow us to determine the composition coverage dimensions and phase separation of the lipid bilayer We will perform corresponding neutron reflectometry experiment and apply for beam time in a separate applicationData will be analysed with the BornAgain software This proposal is
