Importance Peptide nucleic acids PNAs are synthetic nucleic acid analogues with pseudo-peptide backbone which imparts resistance to nuclease enzymes PNAs consist of N-2-aminoethyl-glycine units-based backbone1 Further nucleobases Adenine A Guanine G Cytosine C and Thymine T are attached to the backbone by a methylene carbonyl linkage as depicted in Fig 1 PNAs charge-neutral property enables strong binding with DNA and RNA targets via Watson-Crick WC base pairing This binding could be further increased by introducing cationic functionalities to PNA oligomer12 It has been demonstrated that different designs of PNA can invade double stranded DNA dsDNA and activate DNA repair and recombination events in the mammalian cells to induce site specific gene editing In addition PNAs circumvent many of the aforementioned limitations associated with nuclease and other class of oligonucleotide-based gene editing reagents3-5 In addition PNAs has been extensively used for targeting cancer associated microRNAs for potential cancer therapy6 In prior studies we have demonstrated PNAs can be potentially used to target microRNA-155 for lymphoma therapy in comprehensive preclinical studies However the delivery of PNAs in the cells remains a challenge and on this front we established that poly-lactic-co-glycolic-acids PLGA can be used for delivery of PNAs7 PLGA is a commonly used biodegradable polymer for drug delivery systems and medical devices It has been approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration USFDA and European Medical Agency in a variety of clinical applications An appealing feature of PLGA is that it degrades by hydrolysis into endogenous non-toxic metabolites lactic acid and glycolic acid which enhances its biocompatibility for in vivo delivery The PNAPLGA nanoparticle NP can be synthesized by double emulsion solvent evaporation The efficacy of PNAPLGA depends significantly on their structural stability and release mechanism In past the Bahals research group has demonstrated promising results working at interface of PLGA based delivery of PNAs for diverse biomedical applications We are interested in expanding our understanding about how PNAs chemically interact with PLGA polymer during encapsulation process Though we noticed optimum loading of PNAs in PLGA can be achieved still chemical interactions between PLGA polymer and PNAs need to be revealed These mechanistic studies will expand the new opportunities as well as new BaseAGCorTFigure 1 The basic molecular structure of PNA research avenues to increase the payload of PNAs in PLGA NPs Small angle scattering is a powerful tool which allows in situ time-resolved and structural study However the SAXS data of several PNAPLGA NPs which were collected at the Brookhaven National Lab NSLS-II cannot be not analyzed because of strong absorption of the samples as shown in Fig 2a Here we simulated the SANS pattern of spherical particles with an average radius of 80 nm and a polydispersity of 02 in D2O Fig 2b based on the neutron scattering length density NSLD of 22 x 10-6 -2 calculated from the molecular structure The scattering is presumably sufficient for our data analysis and thus we propose the SANS measurements on the PNAPLGA NPs with different PNAs and correlate its structure with its in vitro efficacy We are also interested in the structural evolution of PNAPLGA during its releasing process The fundamental knowledge will advance our design of the NP platform advancing the research on drug delivery carriers Preliminary Work We have synthesized PNAPLGA and characterized the system using scanning electron microscopy SEM as shown in Fig 3a The NPs seem to be uniform Moreover Fig 3b shows the release mechanisms for different types of PNAs from the NPs indicative of rapid release of PNAs within 8 hours Several important factors may provide some insight to the release mechanism such as the water content in NP the location of PNA in the NP and detailed structure eg possible core-shell of the NP We propose to probe the aforementioned parameters and correlate them with the release mechanism Figure 3 a The size distribution of PNA-1PLGA NPs b

preferable or 30m SANS to characterize several series of PNAPLGA NPs which show distinct efficacies as shown in Fig 3b over a q-range from 0001 -1 to  05 -1 Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We proposed the following experimental activities on three different PNAPLGA NPs PNA-1PLGA PNA-2PLGA and PNA-3PLGA Three possible factors that may affect the efficacy of NPs structure water content and kinetics of structural transformation possibly related to release will be investigated here 1 Structure and water content The SANS will be performed on three types of PNA samples each with four various H2OD2O composition 0100 2575 5050 7525 at a PLGA concentration of 10 mgmL The data will be analyzed with the most appropriate model eg either sphere or core-shell sphere to resolve the structure and the average dimensions of the PNAPLGA NPs The water content can also be obtained in the NPs through simultaneous fitting There are 16 samples including empty PLGA NP in total 2 Structural evolution upon release The structures of the NPs likely change with time We will collect the time-resolved SANS data of each sample at the time intervals of 30 minutes 1 hour 3 hours 10 hours 24 hours and 48 hours respectively From the evolution of structure and water content we will be able to attain the insight to the release mechanism In total we propose 96 measurements 16 samples x 6 time frames Each measurement may take 05  075 hour depending on the NSLD contrast therefore we request 3 days of beamtime for the proposed activities Response to Previous Panel NA Safety Considerations All the samples will be prepared at the proposers home institute There is no hazardous issue with the compounds References 1 Nielsen P E Egholm M Berg R H  Buchardt O Sequenceselective
