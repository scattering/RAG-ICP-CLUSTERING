Probing the interactions of lipid membrane and adjuvants using neutron reflectometry Background In addition to the designated antigens a vaccine contains various additives to enhance the immune response to prevent microbial contamination and to stabilize the vaccine formulations Adjuvant refers to a class of substances that is added to vaccine formulations to enhance the immune responses through physical or chemical association with antigens In the past few decades hundreds of materials have been tried as adjuvant however only aluminum-based adjuvants continue to be used widely in the world ever since 1932 due to their long record of safety and efficacy1-2 There are two major forms of aluminum adjuvants in the market they are aluminum hydroxide AlOH3 and aluminum phosphate AlPO4 Both aluminum adjuvants appear to be colloidal suspensions in bulk however they have vastly different morphologies as seen under the microscope the hydroxide salts appear to be needle-like crystals with dimensions around 10  100 nm whereas the phosphate salts are round particles with sizes in the range of 20 to 40 nm Figure 13-4 Despite the long-standing use of aluminum-containing adjuvants the mechanism by which they selectively enhance the immune response is still poorly understood5-6 At the moment there are two major theories to explain the mechanism of action of aluminum adjuvants The first theory is known as the depot theory it is the oldest and most widely recognized mechanism of action for aluminum adjuvants It considers aluminum adjuvants as depots for antigens at the site of injection allowing sustained release of the antigens thus ensuring the constant stimulation of immune system for production of high antibody titers7-9 However this theory has been challenged recently since research has found that the depot effect does not significantly contributes to adjuvant activity6 10 The second theory proposes that the aluminum adjuvants can bind to plasma membranes causing the lipids to reorganize and form lipid rafts this in turn activates the dendritic cells and promotes the humoral immune response11-12 The experimental foundation for the second theory relies largely on microscopic imaging and immunological assays11 13-14 therefore a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between aluminum adjuvants and membrane lipids at the molecular level will help to better elucidate the mechanisms of adjuvant-induced lipid reorganization in cellular membranes Previously Dhar etal characterized the interactions of DPPCDOPC monolayer with two aluminum adjuvants AlOH3 and AlPO415 Results collected from surface pressure measurements and fluorescence images implied that both aluminum adjuvants lead to the reorganization of lipid domains Consider the distinctly different morphology of AlOH3 and AlPO4 it is hypothesized Figure 1 - Microscopic images of a aluminum hydroxide adjuvant and b aluminum phosphate adjuvant Scale bar  200 nm Images cited from reference3 that the orientation of the adjuvant and the resulting structure of the lipid monolayer could be different between the two aluminum salts15 Proposed Neutron Reflectometry Measurements Therefore in order to provide more details on the molecular interactions between aluminum adjuvants and the lipid membranes we propose to use neutron reflectometry to probe 1 the orientation of two different types of aluminum adjuvants when they get in contact with a model lipid bilayer and 2 any potential changes in the structure of the lipid bilayer as a result of adjuvant interactions Such molecular details will help us to better understand the way different aluminum adjuvants interact with the cell membrane allowing the rational design of novel adjuvants in the future We have performed small angle neutron scattering experiments previously to characterize the interactions between aluminum adjuvants and antigen proteins match points were found for both AlOH3 and AlPO4 In this study we propose to construct a tethered lipid bilayer membrane tBLMs with DPPC and DOPC on Au-coated surface The model tBLMs will be incubated with either AlOH3 crystals or AlPO4 colloidal particles at two concentrations to ensure high homogeneity of the adjuvant samples Neutron reflectivity measurements will then be performed under various buffer backgrounds The complete sample list is shown below Wafer 1 D2O Background H2O Background Contrast Matching Buffer for AlOH3 DPPCDOPC tBLMs Measurement 1 Measurement 2 Measurement 3 Incubate with 001 mgmL of AlOH3 crystals Measurement 4 Measurement 5 Measurement 6 Wafer 2 D2O Background H2O Background Contrast Matching Buffer for AlOH3 DPPCDOPC tBLMs Measurement 7 Measurement 8 Measurement 9 Incubate with 01 mgmL of AlOH3 crystals Measurement 10 Measurement 11 Measurement 12 Wafer 3 D2O Background H2O Background Contrast Matching Buffer for AlPO4 DPPCDOPC tBLMs Measurement 13 Measurement 14 Measurement 15 Incubate with 001 mgmL of AlPO4 colloids Measurement 16 Measurement 17 Measurement 18 Wafer 4 D2O Background H2O Background Contrast Matching Buffer for AlPO4 DPPCDOPC tBLMs Measurement 19 Measurement 20 Measurement 21 Incubate with 01 mgmL of AlPO4 colloids Measurement 22 Measurement 23 Measurement 24 It is assumed that each measurement will take 6 hours to complete also to include the time needed for surface incubation 2 hours each incubation we would like to ask for 24  6 hours  4  2 hours  7 days of beamtime on MAGIK References 1 He P Zou Y Hu Z Advances in aluminum hydroxide-based adjuvant research and its mechanism Hum Vaccin Immunother 2015 11 2 477-88 2 Glenny A T Pope C G Waddington H Wallace U Immunological notes XVII-XXIV The Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology 1926 29 1 31-40 3 HogenEsch H OHagan D T Fox C B Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines you might just get what you want Npj Vaccines 2018 3 4 Harris J R Soliakov A Lewis R J Depoix F Watkinson A Lakey J H AlhydrogelR adjuvant ultrasonic dispersion and protein binding a TEM and analytical study Micron 2012 43 2-3 192-200 5 Hogenesch H Mechanism of immunopotentiation and safety of aluminum adjuvants Front Immunol 2012 3 406 6 Marrack P McKee A S Munks M W Towards an understanding of the adjuvant action of aluminium Nat Rev Immunol 2009 9 4 287-93 7 Siskind G W Benacerraf B Cell selection by antigen in the immune response Adv Immunol 1969 10 1-50 8 Fox C B Kramer R M Barnes V L Dowling Q M Vedvick T S Working together interactions between vaccine antigens and adjuvants Ther Adv Vaccines 2013 1 1 7-20 9 Shardlow E Mold M Exley C From Stock Bottle to Vaccine Elucidating the Particle Size Distributions of Aluminum Adjuvants Using Dynamic Light Scattering Front Chem 2016 4 48 10 Hutchison S Benson R A Gibson V B Pollock A H Garside P Brewer J M Antigen depot is not required for alum adjuvanticity FASEB J 2012 26 3 1272-9 11 Flach T L Ng G Hari A Desrosiers M D Zhang P Ward S M Seamone M E Vilaysane A Mucsi A D Fong Y Prenner E Ling C C Tschopp J Muruve D A Amrein M W Shi Y Alum interaction with dendritic cell membrane lipids is essential for its adjuvanticity Nat Med 2011 17 4 479-87 12 Shi Y To forge a solid immune recognition Protein Cell 2012 3 8 564-70 13 Anderson H A Hiltbold E M Roche P A Concentration of MHC class II molecules in lipid rafts facilitates antigen presentation Nat Immunol 2000 1 2 156-62 14 Kwissa M Lindblad E B Schirmbeck R Reimann J Codelivery of a DNA vaccine and a protein vaccine with aluminum phosphate stimulates a potent and multivalent immune response J Mol Med Berl 2003 81 8 502-10 15 Antunez L R Livingston A Berkland C Dhar P Physiochemical Properties of Aluminum Adjuvants Elicit Differing Reorganization of Phospholipid Domains in Model Membranes Mol Pharm 2016 13 5 1731-7
