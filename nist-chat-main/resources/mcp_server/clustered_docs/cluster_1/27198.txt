 Page 1 of 3 Probing Lateral Lipid Diffusion in Selectively-Deuterated DMPCDSPC Membranes Background Cell membranes provide cell compartmentalization and protection while harboring vital peripheral and integral proteins These membranes are primarily formed of lipid bilayers of various lipid species which are delicately balanced to regulate vital cellular processes such as signaling biomaterial transport cell adhesion and cell division1 Until recently this complex functionality of membranes was attributed to membrane proteins and lipid bilayers were merely treated as a support matrix for proteins However recent studies have established the role of lipid bilayer composition structure and dynamics in determining membrane protein functions2 3 For instance lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions induce lateral membrane heterogeneity in the form of lipid rafts that dictate various membrane functions2 Protein-membrane interactions at the longer timescale micro-seconds to milli-seconds are easier to investigate and these slow dynamics have been linked to various biological functions However it is increasingly recognizable that these slow dynamics have their origins in faster molecular motions through solvent interactions4 or dynamical hierarchy where faster dynamic modes dictate the slower ones5 Faster dynamics in lipid bilayers are difficult to probe experimentally but with the advent of neutron spectroscopy techniques in combination with isotopic labelling of bilayer lipid components faster dynamic time and length scale regimes have been successfully accessed in numerous recent studies6-9 Given the complexity of the lipidome of biological cell membranes and the novelty of the techniques any meaningful investigation of fast membrane dynamics should be conducted on model singlemulti-component systems which while simple can represent select physical phenomena in biological membranes One such example is binary DMPCDSPC membranes which exhibit a rich phase behavior10 11 due to chain length mismatch and represent an ideal system to study dynamics of phase separated lipid domains see Figure 1 At any given DSPC mole fraction the bilayer exists in a mixed fluid phase above the upper transition temperature Tu upper arm in Fig 1A and transitions into a gel-fluid coexistence phase as the temperature is lowered below Tu - where DSPC molecules start to form transient gel nanoclusters and subsequently large thermodynamically-stable gel-domains11 As the temperature further decreases towards the lower transition temperature Tl lower arm in Fig 1A the system transitions into a fully phase-separated gel membrane The domains are rich in the minority component DSPC whereas the matrix is rich in the majority component DMPC The amount of DMPC in DSPC rich domains and DSPC in DMPC-rich matrix can be easily obtained by using the lever rule as shown in Figure 1A Using NSE spectroscopy we have previously9 demonstrated the effects of phase separated DSPC-rich gel domains on the collective dynamics of fluid DMPC-rich matrix Figure 2 discussed in the next section In this study we propose to utilize high-flux backscattering spectrometer HFBS and disk chopper spectrometer DCS at NCNR to explore how lateral diffusion of individual lipid components are affected by the presence of laterally phase separated lipid domains Lateral diffusive properties of lipids obtained through this study will complement our earlier results using the framework12 recently developed by Nagao et al which extracts membrane bending rigidity and viscosity through NSE measurements of collective dynamics Figure 1 A Phase diagram of DMPCDSPC membranes obtained by DSC adapted from ref 10 B Coarse-grained MD simulation of a binary lipid vesicle with relative bending rigidity mismatch of 17 our results manuscript in preparation Page 2 of 3 Previous Experiments In previous neutron spin-echo NSE and SANS experiments 23603 and 25336 - manuscript in preparation we used a selection of protiated tail-deuterated and perdeuterated DMPC and DSPC lipids to selectively probe membrane structure bending and thickness fluctuations in DMPC-rich matrix of 7030 DMPCDSPC molmol binary membrane at various temperatures spanning fluid to the gel-fluid coexistence phase of the mixture Differential Scanning calorimetry DSC measurements on these two systems DMPC DSPC-d83 for selectively measuring bending fluctuations of DMPC-rich matrix and DMPC-d54 DSPC-d83 for selectively measuring thickness fluctuations of DMPC-rich matrix show that the upper and lower transition temperatures occur at 359 C 253 C and 376 C 208 C respectively In comparison the transitions occur at 401 C 26 C see Figure 1A for fully protiated membranes Differences in the transition temperatures are caused by different deuteration levels of DMPC and DSPC used in respective samples Our studies showed that the bending rigidity modulus  of DMPC-rich matrix gradually increased as the temperature was lowered towards Tu suggesting the formation of transient DSPC nanoclusters and it increased further in the phase coexistence region with the growth of large DSPC gel-domains Figure 2A On the other hand pronounced thickness fluctuation dynamics were observed at 50 oC and 40 oC completely fluid but got drastically suppressed at 30C gel-fluid coexistence region Figure 2B According to recent experimental12 and theoretical13 developments in NSE data analysis the dampening of thickness fluctuations observed in the DMPC-rich fluid phase indicates an increase in the matrix viscosity Figure 2C Combined with matrix rigidification this could result from a small transient DSPC gel-nanoclusters11 present in the DMPC-rich fluid matrix eg 13 mol at 30 oC see Lever rule Figure 1A or b mechanical coupling between the DMPC-rich fluid matrix and large DSPC-rich gel domains While the NSE-based approach allows indirect extraction of viscous membrane parameters from slower thickness fluctuation analysis it cannot directly resolve faster lateral lipid diffusion sub nano-second which are necessary to discern the two mechanisms discussed above14 15 Choice of Instruments and Aim of Proposed Experiment A combination of DCS and HFBS spectrometer at NCNR can easily access the nano-second to pico-second dynamics needed to fully understand the lateral motion of individual lipids in these domain-forming bilayers This proposal aims at directly measuring the changes in the lipid lateral diffusion in the DMPC-rich matrix in response to a formation of DSPC gel-nanoclusters and b subsequent formation and growth of large DSPC-rich gel-domains from fluid to coexistence phase Decrease in matrix diffusive dynamics from current proposal

fluid DMPC-rich matrix with the formation and growth of gel DSPC domains Page 3 of 3 fluctuations from NSE will provide direct experimental evidence of hierarchical relations between fast individual lipid dynamics and slower collective membrane dynamics Proposed Experiments The list of samples proposed in Table 1 will allow selective measurements of lateral diffusive dynamics within the DMPC-rich matrix These results will be compared to average lateral dynamics in DMPCDSPC bilayers and in pure DMPC and DSPC bilayers At the two gel-fluid coexistence phase temperatures 35 oC and 30 oC for a 7030 molmol mixture proposed here we expect both large DSPC-rich gel domains and transient DSPC nanoclusters embedded within the DMPC-rich matrix To resolve the effects of the transient DSPC-d83 nanoclusters eg 20 mol  at 35 oC and 13 mol  at 30 oC it is essential to perform measurements on membranes that have the same lipid composition as the fluid matrix at those temperatures Thus vesicles with a composition 8020 and 8713 molmol DMPCDSPC-d83 will be additionally investigated Lipid vesicles will be prepared at 5 ww in D2O by freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion through 100 nm pore-size polycarbonate membrane using established protocols Samples will be loaded in annular sample holders specific to HFBS and DCS with 05 mm internal spacing designed to minimize multiple scattering from samples The HFBS will be configured to probe an energy range of  35 eV q-range of 025 to 176 -1 086 eV range to capture the lipid lateral dynamics that occurs in the 5-20 eV range Neutron wavelength of 64  on DCS will provide 54 eV resolution FWHM to capture faster local dynamics Intensities will be analyzed using DAVE software package and corrected for detector efficiency and background Dynamic structure factors would be Fourier transformed to intermediate scattering functions which will be modeled using a single or multiple stretched exponential to yield the lateral diffusion coefficients as discussed elsewhere16 With the above set of samples we are requesting 10 days on HFBS and 8 days on DCS includes 1 day of elastic scans for HFBS resolution background and temperature equilibration For complimentary structural characterization we have separately requested 1 day of SANS NGB 30m SANS with LENS configuration beamtime if this proposal is accepted References
