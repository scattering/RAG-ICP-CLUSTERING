Cholesterol Effects on Lipid Lateral Diffusion in Saturated and Unsaturated Lipid Membranes Background Lipid bilayers the main matrix of cellular membranes are primarily composed of lipids and sterols which are tightly regulated to enable critical membrane functions such as protein conformational changes and biomaterial transport to name a few To accommodate these different functions membranes constantly modulate their structural and mechanical properties to provide a suitable local environment for biological processes1 Cellular membranes thus dynamically alter their lipid compositions and the local concentrations of rigid inclusions such as cholesterol This pivotal role of cholesterol in modulating bilayer properties is established through controlling the fluidity2 packing density3 and lateral in-plane heterogeneity4 Given the biological relevance of cholesterol it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of how it affects membrane properties at various biologically relevant time and length scales Of particular interest are protein-cholesterol interactions which while manifested over many scales have their origins in fast molecular scale motions that ultimately dictate slower interaction modes5 Over these scales membrane dynamics range from slow collective motions in the form of bending and thickness fluctuation modes with typical relaxation times on the order of nanoseconds and lateral length scales of several hundred lipid molecules ie tens of nanometers to fast lateral lipid diffusion in the picosecond range and over nearest-neighbor length scales The effect of cholesterol on collective membrane fluctuations which dictate membrane mechanical properties such as bending rigidity  area compressibility KA and membrane viscosity  has been the topic of many recent studies using a variety of techniques6-8 However much less is known about faster cholesterol-mediated lipid dynamics Fortunately with the advent of inelastic neutron scattering techniques such as time-of-flight and back-scattering spectrometry in combination with isotopic labelling and contrast matching faster dynamic regimes can now be successfully studied9-12 Together with neutron spin-echo NSE these techniques offer a unique non-invasive probe that selectively accesses specific dynamic modes in lipid membranes enabling a more holistic picture of the hierarchy of dynamics that control biological function in lipid membranes Ultimately studies of this type are key to understanding the design elements of biological membranes and their utility in engineering synthetic cells They are also a requisite for refining force fields in molecular dynamics MD simulations that are progressively needed to comprehend the complexity of cell membranes In this proposal we aim to leverage on new exciting results that we recently obtained using NSE and solid-state 2H spectroscopy that revealed a long-debated universal effect of cholesterol on lipid membranes Unlike previous reports of a negligible effect of cholesterol in unsaturated lipid membranes13 we demonstrated that cholesterol exhibits a stiffening effect on all types of membranes but with varying degrees depending on the degree of unsaturation of the lipid acyl chains In this study we propose to utilize the High-Flux Backscattering Spectrometer HFBS and the Disc Chopper Spectrometer DCS at NCNR to explore how lateral diffusion of individual lipid components with various degrees of unsaturation are affected by various concentrations of cholesterol Lipid diffusive properties obtained from this study will complement our earlier results using NSE and solid-state NMR spectroscopy Previous Experiments and Results We recently used NSE with structural characterization using SANS and solid-state 2H NMR to probe collective fluctuations in cholesterol-enriched lipid membranes NSE measurements were run on fully-protiated and tail-perdeuterated vesicles of di-monounsaturated DOPC 181-181 and cholesterol in D2O to study membrane bending and thickness fluctuations respectively The former yielded direct measurements of the membrane bending rigidity  using the Zilman-Granek model14 with corrections by Watson and Brown15 Thickness fluctuations were analyzed using the framework proposed by Nagao et al16 which allows the extraction of membrane viscosity using the polymer brush model17 The results show a gradual increase in  with increasing cholesterol content Fig 1C These results are consistent with the universal condensing effect of cholesterol on lipid membranes where cholesterol causes lipid acyl chain ordering leading to increased lipid packing and bilayer thickness18-19 Thickness fluctuation analysis showed a significant increase in membrane viscosity with increasing cholesterol loading in DOPC membranes Figure 2 The caveat is that while the NSE-based approach allows indirect extraction of viscous membrane parameters from slower thickness fluctuation analysis it cannot directly resolve faster lateral lipid diffusion sub-ns20-21 Furthermore we recently obtained similar bending rigidity results from solid-state 2H-NMR spectroscopy Fig 1 The model-free functional dependence of spin lattice relaxation rates R1Z on segmental order parameters SCD8 unambiguously indicated increased membrane bending rigidity with cholesterol These results were contextualized within the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which connects relaxations from thermal fluctuations in liquid-crystalline membranes to quasi-elastic deformation on mesoscopic length scales Parallel studies on membranes with different lipid unsaturation indicated that cholesterol-induced stiffening is present in all membranes What is more the extent of stiffening was shown to be dependent on the degree of unsaturation in the acyl chains DMPC22  POPC  DOPC These results along with supporting MD simulations emphasize the importance of understanding membrane dynamics over the lengthtime scales of biological processes However as can be seen in Fig 1B the spin lattice relaxations show deviations from the expected square-law dependence which could be explained in terms of additional dynamic modes that are yet to be determined To investigate these additional contributions we propose to understand how cholesterol affects local and diffusive lipid motions in relation to its hierarchical effect on membrane dynamics Choice of Instruments and Aim of Proposed Experiment The complete range of dynamics in the ps-ns scale in cholesterol-containing bilayers can be easily accessed through quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS experiments using a combination of High-flux Backscattering HFBS Spectrometer and the Disc-Chopper Spectrometer DCS at NCNR This proposal aims at directly measuring how cholesterol affects lipid lateral diffusion in membranes where lipids have Figure 2 A NSE relaxation rates measured on tail-deuterated DOPC membranes in deuterated buffer

studies different degrees of unsaturation Changes in diffusive dynamics current proposal coupled with bending and thickness fluctuations from previous NSE experiments and elastic relaxations from NMR experiments will provide direct experimental evidence of hierarchical relations between fast individual lipid dynamics and slower collective membrane dynamics The obtained results will be used to contextualize the biological role of cholesterol on the nanoscale Proposed Experiments Here we will focus on three different lipids with varying degrees of unsaturation 1 saturated DMPC 140-140 2 POPC 160-181 with one mono-unsaturated tail and 3 DOPC 181-181 with two mono-unsaturated tails Vesicle samples will be prepared by thin-film hydration at 5 ww in D2O followed by freeze-thaw cycles and subsequent extrusion through 50 nm pore-size polycarbonate membrane All vesicles will contain 4 mol of the analogous PS lipid phosphoserine eg DMPS in DMPC POPS in POPC DOPS in DOPC to avoid formation of multilamellar vesicles23 Samples will be loaded in annular sample holders specific to HFBS and DCS with 05 mm internal spacing designed to minimize multiple scattering from samples The HFBS will be operated at  17 eV range resolution  09 eV q-range of 025 to 176 -1 to capture the lipid lateral dynamics that occurs in the 5-20 eV range DCS will use incident neutrons of wavelength 64  providing 54 eV resolution FWHM Intensities will be analyzed using DAVE software package and corrected for detector efficiency and background Dynamic structure factors would be Fourier transformed to intermediate scattering functions which will be modeled using a single or multiple stretched exponential to yield the lateral diffusion coefficients as discussed elsewhere24 The results will then be combined and interpreted with the results of our solid-state 2H-NMR and NSE experiments With the above set of samples we are requesting 9 days on HFBS and 6 days on DCS including 2 days for elastic scans on HFBS resolution background and temperature equilibration For complimentary structural characterization we have separately requested 1 day of SANS NGB 30m SANS with LENS configuration 1-15 hours per sample beamtime if this proposal is accepted References 1 Cherry R J Brkli A Busslinger M Schneider G In Rotational Diffusion of Proteins in Membranes Biochemistry of Membrane Transport Berlin Heidelberg
