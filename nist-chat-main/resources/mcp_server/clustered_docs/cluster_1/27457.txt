Determining lipid domain stability in the presence of long chain alcohols Scientific Background Plasma membranes are in constant contact with their environment This proximity potentiates interactions with external factors Such examples include a diversity of aliphatic alcohols For instances cells come into contact with ethanol after alcohol consumption and longer chain alcohols have been used as anesthetics and surfactants This contact can often elicit changes in membrane properties which can have biological and physiological consequences eg bilayer thickness changes influence protein function and partitioning  As a result there has been an increasing number of studies looking into the interplay between alcohols and lipid bilayers In general lipid-alcohol interactions are understood to be a cornerstone of n-alcohol biological activity with their specific interactions with proteins being another Owing to their aliphatic tail n-alcohols can penetrate and remain within membranes changing the local lipid properties In this way the anesthetic potency of alcohols generally increases with increasing chain length which coincides with their ability to partition into bilayers  Interestingly at chain lengths of greater than C13 n-alcohols become non-anesthatic often called a cut-off All in all these factors have fueled an increasing interest in the membrane-perturbing role of these aliphatic alcohols Recently several groups have published studies that examine n-alcohol localization in the bilayer transverse normal to the bilayer plane and their effects on the transversal bilayer structure 1- For example small angle neutron scattering and diffraction SANS and SAND respectively showed that increasing n-alcohol chain length resulted in thickness increases in bilayers composed of Di181 PC  We aim to compliment this picture with investigating the role these aliphatic alcohols have on lipid dynamics  and another manuscript in preparation and in the present proposal on the lateral organization of lipids Lateral organization of lipids into domains are necessary scaffolds for lipid rafts and have been shown to influence protein activity and localization Little is known about the role aliphatic alcohols may have on such an important bilayer property Lipid-only domains are well-established mimetic systems for membrane rafts to allow their study under strictly controlled conditions We propose to apply SANS in a different manner to study the influence and partitioning of n-alcohols into coexisting liquid-ordered Lo and liquid- disordered Ld phases Specifically we will investigate alcohols with chain-lengths of C12-20 with emphasis on the C2n tails which coincides with n-alcohols activity and supposed cut-off These investigations will broaden the understanding of the behavior of n-alcohols in domains and Figure 1 Iq scattering curves of DMPC scrambling between protiated and deuterated liposomes left Normalized intensity decay curves show that increasing volume percentage of methanol promotes DMPC mixing right Figure is from reference  potentially propose a mode-of-action for n-alcohols in cellular pathways Previous Results On aliphatic alcohols we have previously employed time-resolved SANS to measure the lipid exchange between bilayer leaflets and between vesicles under methanolic conditions as seen in Fig 1  We have extended this to include longer-chain alcohols C2-14 and the manuscript is in preparation Through these studies we have uncovered a cut-off corresponding to the chain length of n-alcohols and their ability to influence lipid dynamics Furthermore this cut-off was found to closely resemble the alkyl chain length of the studied lipid bilayer instead of a universal n  13 seen in anesthetic ability We are curious to see if this holds true for lipid domain formation as well Our group has also successfully studied lipid rafts using SANS by incorporating well-defined contrast-matching strategies  In brief by matching the aqueous solvent to the average bilayer composition the transverse bilayer scattering contribution that typically dominates the scattering signal is suppressed such that scattering can be correlated to segregation of chain-deuterated lipids from protiated lipids SANS is capable of probing transitions that are on a more precise scale than bulk order transitions as detectable by differential scanning calorimetry making it a highly complementary and compatible technique to lipid vesicles systems We have collected preliminary SANS data showing the effect of tocopherol on the model phase-separating mixture DPPCDOPCChol 37537525 with 10 mol of each tocopherol species Fig 2 We will extend this expertise towards n-alcohols Choice of Instrument The typical SANS q window covers only a relatively small part of the region where the scattering form factor is most sensitive to differences in domain size VSANS can extend this window to larger length scales and potentially allow us to realize domains which are not detectable in a standard SANS experiment C B A Figure 2 SANS reveals domain stability in lipid vesicles SANS intensity vs q for 100nm vesicles composted of DPPCDOPCChol 37537525 at various temperatures as indicated by the legends Grey plots represent the vesicle domains melting in the absence of tocopherol Blue plots represent the system melting in the presence of 10 mol A -tocopherol B -tocopherylquinone C -tocopherol A decrease in coherent scattering correlates to the destabilization of domains by a decrease in domain area fraction or homogeneity Aims of Proposed Experiments and Estimate of Beamtime We will collect SANS data for 100nm diameter lipid vesicles prepared at a concentration of 20mgml A well characterized and known domain-forming monounsaturated system DPPCDOPCChol 37537525 will be used  This system will be prepared with varying concentrations of n-alcohols 0 2 5 10 mol of varying chain lengths C12 C14 C16 and C18 to define phase perturbations and due to their biological relevance according to their anesthetic ability as well as their matching carbon lengths to the model phospholipids used The n-alcohols chosen are also based upon their similar phase-state at room temperature The lipid vesicles will be prepared with 345 vv D2O such that the average bilayer composition is contrast-matched to the solvent and thus phase-separation into domains will be proportional to scattering intensity These samples will be measured twice at five temperature points within the range of 15-45C to account for hysteresis effects of domain melting and formation The ability to collect data in a single configuration of VSANS is ideal since it reduces detector movement while still allowing high quality large structural domain data to be collected We will be able to collect sufficient data for each sample condition in about 30 minutes using the standard wavelength spread of 10  complemented by a single detector configuration to collect within the range 0004q02
