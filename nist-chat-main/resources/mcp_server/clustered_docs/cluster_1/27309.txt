November 14 2019 1Enhanced dynamics near the phase transition for lysolipid incorporated lipid bilayersBackgroundDrug delivery systems have long attracted researchers with the goal of specifically targeting thera-peutics to the disease sites of action The encapsulation of drugs in the transport vehicle and theircontrolled release at the target sites are a key design features of these delivery systems One promis-ing class of systems that are being investigated are lipid vesicles containing lysolipids single tail lipidmolecules that increase the drug permeability at the gel-fluid transition of the main componentdouble tail lipid 1  The idea is control the temperature below the transition during the trans-portation and increasing temperature above the transition when the vehicle arrives at the target siteto release the drugLysolipids are single tail lipid molecules easily dissolve into water and have relatively low criticalmicellar concentration cmc 3  When lysolipids are mixed with double chain lipids three typesof structure form 1 the lysolipids partition into the double chain lipid vesicles at low lysolipidconcentration 2 mixed micelles coexist with double chain lipid vesicles above a threshold lysolipidconcentration and 3 only micelles form above a second threshold of higher lysolipid concentra-tion In the low concentration regime where the lysolipid partitions in the bilayer the lipid bilayerpermeability increases at temperatures corresponding to the gel-fluid transition The mechanism ofincreased permeability is explained using the bilayer lipid heterogeneity model where the interfacialregions between coexisting gel and fluid phases are thought to be leaky  The maximum drug re-lease rates were obtained approximately 1 C below the melting transition temperature of the maincomponent lipid which led to a postulated release mechanism based on pre-melting of grain bound-aries in gel phase phospholipid memranes It was speculated that lysolipids leave the membrane fromgrain boundaries upon heating to temperature 1 C below the melting transition which enables theencapsulated drugs permeate Lysolipids also induces shape changes from the unilamellar vesicles Cryo-TEM transmissionelectron microscopy images show that when extruded unilamellar vesicles are subject of cycling aboveand below the melting transition temperature formation of disks and open liposomes are induced The disks and open liposomes form after five temperature cycles when the main component lipidis mixed with lysolipid and polyethylene glycol derivatized phosphatidyl ethanolamine lipids PEG-lipid On the other hand the disk formation was upon suppressed without added PEG-lipidTherefore that PEG-lipid is needed to sterically stabilize open liposome structures and prevent theirclosure or fusion with other membranes The drug release capability at the transition however didnot change with or without PEG-lipid This result suggests that the disk or open liposome structuresare not responsible for the drug release Instead literature suggests that lateral segregation betweensingle and double tail lipids are sufficient for the membrane permeation and we speculate that thereare likely pores forming at the transition that are stabilized by the lysolipidPore formation near the phase transition would be associated with an increase in the membranedynamics and fluctuations In particular membrane thickness fluctuations are known to controlstochastic pore formation  Such pore formations can be dynamic - meaning they will open andclose in a finite time scale - and therefore we would like to measure corresponding bilayer dynamicsat temperatures near the phase transition where the pores are formingPreliminary resultWe have performed a preliminary small-angle neutron scattering SANS and neutron spin echo2NSE experiment for large unilamellar vesicles LUVs composed of dimyristoyl glycero phospho-choline DMPC and myristoyl hydroxy glycero phosphocholine 140 Lyso which have the samehead group chemistry with either diacyl or single acyl tails LUVs with 100 nm diameter wereprepared in D2O The SANS profiles did not show a signature of mixed micelles coexisting withLUVs in our concentration range up to a mole fraction of 10  lysolipid in the lipid mixtures32s33s34s35s36s37s32s33s34s34s35s38s39s40s41s42s43s44s36s45s36s34s46s45s46s34s35s45s35s34s33s45s43s39s40s47s48s44s39s49s50s51s48s52s34s53s45s54s33s36s55s34s56s57s58s59s39s49s50s51s48s52s33s34s54s33s36s55s34s56s57s58s59Figure 1 Temperature dependence of the bending mod-ulus of DMPC bilayers incorporated with 140 Lyso lipidWhen increasing the amount of Lysolipid loading the bend-ing modulus became smaller especially in the vicinity of themelting transition temperature shown by the dashed line10 loaded DMPC bilayer shows clear softeningIn the low concentration regime where thelysolipid partitions in the bilayer the changesin bending modulus  measured with NSE areshown in Figure 1 At low loading the bendingmodulus in the fluid phase gradually increased astemperature decreased toward the melting tran-sition temperature Tm of the DMPC bilayersshown as a dashed line in the figure and in-creased by approximately an order of magnitudebelow Tm Meanwhile a clear softening is ob-served right above Tm for the DMPC  10 140Lyso sample Also  is smaller in the gel phasecomparing to the low loading condition Theseresults indicate that the membrane dynamics areenhanced near the phase transition point at highloading conditions which supports our hypothesis that pores are forming in the membraneProposed experimentWe would like to measure the temperature variation of the bending modulus with 10 lysolipidwith better temperature steps We would like to scan the sample with a step of 1 C near Tm withtemperatures of 15 20 22 23 24 25 26 28 30 and 35 C In this way we will be able to betterunderstand the dynamic changes near the transition due to the presence of lyoslipid We also wantto measure one more loading condition say 5 for 3 temperatures at 15 25 and 35 CWe also want to measure thickness fluctuations with high loading condition around Tm We knowthat the transition temperature will be decreased about 4 C when tail-deuterated DMPC is usedSo we will scan temperatures of T  Tm  -4 -2 -1 1 2 and 4 CIn order to minimize the counting time we will use 100mgmL lipid solutions In this case thebending measurement will be finished in 6 h per condition while 1 day is needed for the thicknessfluctuations Bending measurement will thus take about 4 days including background and thethickness fluctuation measurements will need 8 days including background and resolution Thereforewe request total 12 days of NSE time for these experiment We will follow the same procedures forthe data reductionanalysis to the paper published before  MC Sandstrom LM Ickenstein LD Mayer and K Edwards J Contr Release 107 131 2005 JK Mills and D Needham Biochim Biophys Acta 1716 77 2005 RE Stafford T Fanni and EA Dennis Biochemistry 28 5113 1989 JR Henriksen TL Andresen LN Feldborg L Duelund and JH Ipsen Biophys J 98 2199 2010 D Needham and MW Dewhirst Adv Drug Deliv Rev 53 285 2001 LM Ickenstein MC Arfvidsson D Needham LD Mayer and K Edwards Biochim Biophys Acta1614 135 2003 L Movileanu and D Popescu Recent Res Devel Biophys 3 61 2004 M Nagao EG Kelley R Ashkar R Bradbury and PD Butler J Phys Chem Lett 8 4679 2017
