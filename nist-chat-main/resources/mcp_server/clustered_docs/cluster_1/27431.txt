Mitochondrial lipid packing in healthy and cancerous cell lines Scientific Background Apoptosis is programmed cell death that is essential for physiological development and tissue homeostasis From a biochemical standpoint this process can be exploited to target and eliminate specific cell types such as cancer cells Pancratistatin PST is an antiviral alkaloid metabolite that has demonstrated directed apoptotic action on various human cancer cell lines while having minimalno toxic effect on normal cells Figure 1  Conversely PST has been hindered from clinical trial usage due to its low availability in nature Recently multiple PST synthesis schemes were published making PST accessible  Multiple human cancer cell lines were successfully treated with synthetically derived PST including testicular breast liver pancreatic and neuroblastoma cancer cells 1 However the exact nature of how PST operates and eliminates cancer cells remains unknown This obstructs PSTs perception as an effective cancer treatment as a lack of mechanistic comprehension leaves a large gap in the advancement of PST based therapy Figure 1 - The chemical structure of Pancratistatin and its hypothesized interaction with the membranes Previous Results - Model Systems The inner mitochondrial membrane IMM depends heavily on cardiolipin CL as a proton trap and protein stabilizing agent More specifically CL helps maintain the functionally active forms of the proteins in the electron transport chain ETC such as complex 1 2 and 3 In literature the idea of transient cardiolipin micro domains as a functional platform for the ETC proteins is rather popular These CL rafts help localize the ETC proteins into a supercomplex allowing for more efficient electron transfer It is quite possible that PST inhibits the formation of these rafts thus altering the lipid packing by preventing or disassembling them leading the ETC to be less effective and eventually causing cell death Recent neutron spin-echo results indicate that PST softens the membrane thus it is likely this action occurs in the cell and induces disorder in the IMM Aims of Proposed Experiments and Estimate of Beamtime - Transition into living systems Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of small angle neutron scattering can yield the inner membrane ordering and structure  The inner membrane ordering of heart mitochondria is higher than that of liver mitochondria which is determined by the lamellar packing of the membranes Here we propose to use vSANS to compare the mitochondrial membrane structure and lipid packing order of healthy and cancerous mitochondria from multiple cell types in the presence and absence of the mitochondria targeting agent PST The results of the proposed experiments have a two-fold impact i the results will shed light on the mechanism of PSTs action and ii why PST only acts on cancerous cells Cell lines that will be used in this experiment include normal human fibroblasts NHF A375 and G361 human melanoma cell lines HT-29 and HCT 116 human colorectal cancer cell lines normal-derived colon mucosa NCM460 cell line All cells mentioned above will be cultured according to a previously published protocol  PST will be delivered from a stock containing PTS dissolved in ddH2O to the cells directly via their culture medium Mitochondria will be isolated through centrifugation followed by buffer exchange to exchange H2O for D2O Small angle neutron scattering SANS can be applied for structural studies of live membrane systems Compared to other biophysical techniques SANS offers many advantages for the study of biological systems Neutron scattering is sensitive to light elements eg H C N O etc commonly found in biological systems and more specifically lipids in biological membranes The CHRNS VSANS instrument is ideal for the proposed experiments as it provides the desired q-range in one instrumental configuration Past reports demonstrate that the lipid packing of healthy mitochondria yield the first broad Bragg peak centered at q0026 - 0029 -1  Using a neutron wavelength  of 53  will be used with two detector carriages with sample-to-detector distances of 4 m and 19 m to accesses yielded a q-range of 0003 -1 to 012 -1 Data will be collected in 1- 2 hour acquisition times at 37 C We wish to measure 3 cell lines and their respective cancer lines in the presence and absence of PST Corresponding chemically scrambled analogues will be measured We anticipate 24 samples 1 background and the necessary measurements for data reduction we request 2 days of VSANS beamtime References  McLachlan et al 2005 Pancratistatin A Natural Anti-Cancer Compound that Targets Mitochondria Specifically in Cancer Cells to Induce Apoptosis Apoptosis 10 619-630  Rinner U and Hudlicky T 2005 Synthesis of Amaryllidaceae Constituents -
