Structural investigation of binding of curcumin to -Lactoglobulin and pectin complexes using SANS and USANS Scientific background and aim Functional food is defined as foods or ingredients of foods that provide an additional physiological benefit beyond their basic nutrition1 There has been an increase in the demands of consumption of functional foods due to various reasons such as increase in aging population increase in lifestyle related problems such as obesity heart diseases and also the increase in awareness towards healthy eating23 Incorporating bioactives directly in the food system is challenging as they are unstable at food processing and storage conditions like high temperature pressure oxygen stability etc Designing appropriate encapsulation systems for the bioactives is one approach to protect these compounds which would increase their shelf life and aid in targeted release Most bioactives eg genistein resveratrol are hydrophobic molecules and do not dissolve in aqueous solutions4 Curcumin solubility in water is  6 gml5 has been chosen as a model bioactive as it can represent the hydrophobic bioactive molecules to see if this complex is ideal for encapsulating such compounds Curcumin has various beneficial properties anti-cancerous anti-oxidant anti-microbial anti-inflammatory6 It is chemically unstable non-bioavailable has poor solubility in aqueous media and is degradable in environment stress conditions7 Hence in spite of having a range of health benefits it cannot be utilized by the body For effective curcumin delivery in the gut a biopolymer based colloidal delivery system incorporating protein and polysaccharide coacervate as an encapsulation system is being investigated When two liquid phases separate out in a colloidal system it is known as coacervation The coacervate phase is the one which is more concentrated in components7 They are mostly formed by the electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged compounds proteins and polysaccharides in this case In this proposed experiment we chose -Lactoglobulin Blg variant A and pectin as model protein and polysaccharide respectively Aim To investigate whether the presence of hydrophobic bioactive molecules curcumin either interrupts or enhances the formation of the self-assembly of the coacervates in solution as the structure formation is important to encapsulate the components effectively The change in the structures will then be compared at different pH of the gastrointestinal GI tract this will help to determine if this system can be used to carry the bioactives through the GI tract On this basis small-angle neutron scattering is a useful tool to measure the changes in terms of the coacervate shape composition and the internal organization A wide q range is required to study these multi length scale protein-polysaccharide complexes of 6-8 micron size by combining SANS and USANS Preliminary experiments Blg and pectin coacervates at various protein to polysaccharide molar concentrations has been elaborately studied using SAXS and SANS8 Fig 1 The optimum molar ratios for coacervate formation has been screened through this study UV-Vis spectroscopy showed that the encapsulation efficiency of these coacervates with curcumin was quite high  95  SANS has been used for studying the complex formed with Blg and curcumin Fig 2 Blg showed a globular structure the radius of gyration calculated for Blg was 2094  indicated its dimeric at the conditions used and also after addition of curcumin to Blg radius of gyration was found to be 2172  which is in accordance to literature where the radius of gyration for dimeric Blg was reported to be 2176  03 and 2246  03  9 This shows binding of curcumin to Blg does not change the structure of curcumin Experiment conditions and Data Analysis The experiments will be performed at three pH conditions pH 2 4 and 7 pH 4 The samples will be prepared and studied at pH 4 as pectin is negatively charged and protein is positively charged leading to coacervate formation due to electrostatic interactions All the samples will be prepared in 20 mM citrate buffer having 20 mM sodium chloride pH 7 The bioactives are generally known to be absorbed in the colon which has a pH of around 7 Here the complex should dissociate to release the bioactives The pH of the samples will be brought up to pH 7 by using NaOH to observe how the structure changes compared to the initial formation at pH 4 pH 2 Before reaching the colon they pass through the stomach which has a pH of around 2 there should be little or no release of the bioactives at this condition The change in the coacervate structure needs to be studied at this pH to understand how the complexes behave at around pH 2 So the coacervates formed at pH 4 will be brought down to pH 2 Two sets of samples need to be prepared for SANS and USANS experiments one with hydrogenated Blg and the other with deuterated Blg both in D2O buffers We have screened the concentrations based on the previous experiment8 to gain good scattering intensities in SANS and USANS region Serial No Sample Molar ratios pH 1 Blg Apectin 151 2 representing pH of

deuterated Blg A so 12 x 2 24 samples in total The data will be analysed by ATSAS software package PRIMUS will be used to calculate the structural parameters of individual components while CRYSON will be used to compare scattering data with PDB data IRENA software package will be used to generate Kratky plots as previously done8 SANS will be done to selectively observe the scattering of each component In order to study the effect of pectin inside the coacervate complex we will need to contrast match the protein by deuterating Blg to get SLD of Blg A 6x10-6 -2 similar to that of D2O This will allow the precise determination of the location internal organisation and conformational changes of BlgA inside of the BlgApectin complex The contrast between BlgA and pectin is also enhanced this way allowing better selectivity and cleaner data interpretation  The X-ray and neutron SLDs are listed in Table 2 The q range selected for SANS 0004-05 -1 8 which was also in accordance to the calculation of SAXS and SANS profiles using the program CRYSON from the ATSAS package from the Protein Data Bank PDB structure 1BEB We will measure three background conditions 100 D2O and empty cell 2  3 h  6 h 5 controls Buffer HBlg dBlg Pectin curcumin and 24 samples which is 29 samples in total Assuming 3 hr measurement time for each sample sample changing we need approximately 96 hours  4 days USANS The size of the coacervates formed were around 6 microns range studied from light scattering Therefore we propose to also use USANS to study this coacervates The wavelength to be used is 24 -1 over a q-range from 35x10-5 to 0001 -1 After processing the two datasets from SANS and USANS will be fit using models smeared to the corresponding experimental resolutions Judging from our previous scattering in the SANS regime we expect average measurement times of 5-6h per sample for a USANS measurement Taking into consideration an empty cell measurement and the time required to set up the instrument we estimate 55h x 24  55h x Empty  2-3h alignment  6 days of USANS beamtime Part of the PhD Thesis of Sunandita Ghosh University of Auckland New Zealand and thesis submission date is 310121
