AnalysisofBRAFinteractionontetheredbi-layerlipidmembranesusingneutronreflec-tivityIntroductionRas genes are well established as the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer  RAS exists as three isoforms H N and K-RAS These RAS isoforms have different mutational frequencies in human cancers with KRAS being the most frequent The RAS proteins function as a molecular switch that transmit mitogenic signals across the cell membrane When RAS is active in the GTP state and binds to a series of effector proteins with RAF kinase being one of the best characterized The hydrolysis of GTP to GDP results in a conformational change such that RAS no longer interacts with effector proteins RAS only activates RAF kinase when bound to a membrane  so defining how KRAS interacts with RAF on a membrane is fundamental to understanding this process There are three RAF isoforms with highly similar domain architecture Figure 1 The Ras-binding domain RBD binds with high affinity to KRAS KD 50-150 nM The Cysteine Rich Domain CRD of CRAF is required for targeting to the membrane  and enhancing the interaction with RAS  Once RAF dimerizes and is activated the kinase domain phosphorylates its substrate MEK kinase Over the several years we have made a con-certed effort to producing domains and full-length version of RAF proteins Previously we have meas-ure the orientation of RBD-CRD with the membrane using NR see Figure 2 We have also been successful in producing full length BRAF and RAF1 from insect cells Preparations of BRAF are more homogeneous and purify as a heterodimer of 2 protomers of BRAF and 2 protomers of the chaperone protein 14-3-3 Recently a cryo-EM structure of BRAF in complex with a chaperone protein 14-3-3 and its substrate MEK was solved  In this complex the binding of 14-3-3 to BRAF resulted in a conformation where the CRD was occluded However preliminary SPR experiments we have con-ducted demonstrated full length BRAF in complex with 14-3-3 bind to nanodiscs containing anionic lipids Our objective is to determine the structural arrangement of KRAS bound with full length RAF but an important step along that path is defining the orientation of BRAF in the absence of KRAS Figure 1 Structural domains in the RAF family of proteins RBD RAS binding domain CRD Cysteine rich domain SerThr-rich sequences BRS BRAF-specific region adapted from PreviousExperimentsWe are able to produce RAF1 RBD-CRD with a yield of 3 mgL and is sufficient for biophysical measurements Using surface plasmon resonance experiments have shown that this RBD-CRD con-struct binds to lipid membrane in a phosphatidyl-serine dependent manner We have solved the struc-ture of RBD-CRD using NMR Our current efforts are focused solving the structure of RBD-CRD bound to bicelles Previous neutron reflectivity NR experiments indicate that RBD-CRD lies about 20A adjacent from the lipid headgroup The protein appears to be monomeric at the membrane inter-face Fig 3 Initial fits of the NR profile using our solution structure of RBD-CRD indicate that the structure appears too narrow to fit within the protein density profile This result might indicate that either the solution structure is not 100 valid for the membrane-bound protein or that proteins in different orientations at different membrane penetration depths coexist Repeat NR experiments com-plimentary experimental techniques and MD simulations will be used to refine and interpret this struc-tural result Figure 2 Volume occupancy profile of 5M Raf1-RBD-CRD at a 7030 POPCPS membrane measured during

x-ray structure is not valid for the membrane-bound state of the protein ProposedExperimentsExperiment1OrientationofBRAFontetheredbilayersPrevious NR experiments were done with Raf1 and BRaf RBD-CRD We now wish to extend those studies to include full length BRaf in complex with 14-3-3 We therefore propose the following two initial sets of measurements The measurement of the complex will be done at a later time if the initial measurements yield a positive result and warrant efforts for deuteration of one of the binding partners 1 Prepare two separate tethered bilayer lipid membranes composed of 7030 mol POPC POPS and characterize them using NR 2 Bind either BRAF or 14-3-3 to the anionic membrane and determine the structure as a refer-ence Measurement during protein incubation 3 Measurement after buffer rinse to discriminate against non-specific membrane binding Each step we will be measures using three distinct bulk solvent contrasts for each 6hrs of measurement time is required for good counting statistics at NG-D Magik Therefore we request 2 protein variants  3 conditions  3 contrasts  7 h  126 h In total this is 6 days including time for instrument setup and sample changes In total we request 6 days of beam time on NGD-Magik References 1 Stephen AG et al Dragging ras back in the ring Cancer Cell 2014 253 p 272-81 2 Stokoe D and F McCormick Activation of
