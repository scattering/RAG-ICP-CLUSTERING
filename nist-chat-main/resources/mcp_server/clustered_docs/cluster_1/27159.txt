Investigating cell-cell adhesion and alignment in engineered biofilms Priya Chittur Rachel R Ford and Julia A Kornfield Background A biofilm is a cohesive material entirely formed from microbes and their extracellular sticky polymeric substances Biofilms are unique materials in that the properties of the whole are entirely generated by the individual units the cells whose genetics determine cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion signaling pathways to respond to the environment motility and expression of matrix componentsall of which work together to build a bulk-scale material with certain desired measurable physical properties The process by which a single cell replicates to form a bulk material is a relatively unexplored area of microbiology Recent studies123 have begun addressing this question and have shown that cellular order is indeed present varying with location in the biofilm age of the film and cell-cell interaction strength These studies were performed on V cholerae biofilms from 0-18 hours of the life cycle using high magnification spinning disk confocal microscopy and tracking up to 10000 individual cells It was discovered that the expression of RbmA the main protein that mediates cell-cell adhesion in V cholerae biofilms is inversely related to cell-cell spacing Further there is a strong structural difference between the outer biofilm edge and the central region where cells at the periphery are aligned radially throughout growth while cells at the center of the mature biofilm are aligned parallel to one another along the vertical direction This ordering also depends on RbmA expression and age of the biofilm These recent studies suggest that investigating cellular ordering and packing in a biofilm is a valid question and is closely tied to cell-cell interaction strength However biofilms are strongly optically scattering these studies were performed on biofilms in the first 18 hours of growth with less than 30 m thickness As the biofilms approach hundreds of microns in thickness only fluorescence signal from the top 30-50 m can be detected both due to scattering as well as the short working distance of the high magnification lenses With neutrons able to overcome such limitations of light microscopy we propose to further explore cell packing and adhesion and the possible correlations between bulk scale features such as mechanical behavior and microscopic biofilm architecture eg cell orientation packing and potential long range order Connecting the two scales would not only shed light on a poorly understood area of microbiology but also enable the design of better engineered biofilm-based protective materials Preliminary Results In collaboration with the Tirrell group at Caltech we study the adhesive effects of different associative peptides and proteins on the surface of E coli DH10B unpublished an otherwise poor biofilm former The surface-expressed proteins include complementary peptide-protein pair SpyTag and SpyCatcher that can spontaneously form isopeptide bonds4 and long elastin-like-polypeptide ELP 25 residues disordered sequences with varying repeat lengths E3 and E6 for three and six repeats of ELP respectively By tuning the cell-cell interaction strength the bulk biofilm properties can be tuned as well In Figure 1 a fluorescence micrograph of a region of a SpyTag-only biofilm shows pockets spanning 6-8 m devoid of cells as well as cell arrangements that suggest hexagonal close packing However fluorescence microscopy cannot probe a the strength of order b the size distribution of these features or c the bulk film beyond 50 m depth due to opacity of the films We need a method that can overcome these limitations in order to fully understand how bulk properties precipitate from cell-cell ordering and surface protein association Proposed Experiment We propose to probe the extent and characteristics of cellular ordering in mature E coli biofilms with varying cell-cell interaction strength using ultra-small angle neutron scattering The biofilms are 100-250 m thick 1 cm diameter and supported on polycarbonate filters with track-etched 02 m pores We will create a series of homologous pairs of samples grown on either D2O-based media or H2O-based media and use demountable titanium cells with a 4 mm spacer We will examine six different surface protein combinations E3 E6 SpyTag alone SpyCatcher alone SpyTagSpyCatcher and a control with no associative surface proteins We will also study two different ages of biofilms 7 days and 21 days Based on previous USANS studies by the Kornfield Group we anticipate an acquisition time of around one hour for the q-range 3x10-5 - 1x10- -1 leading to a total of 24 hours of beam time needed References 1 Drescher K et al Architectural transitions in Vibrio cholerae biofilms at single-cell resolution Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113 E2066-E2072 2016 2 Yan J Sharo A Stone H Wingreen N  Bassler B Vibrio cholerae biofilm growth program and architecture revealed by single-cell live imaging Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113 E5337-E5343 2016 3Hartmann R et al Emergence of three-dimensional order and structure in growing biofilms Nature Physics 15 251-256 2018 4 Sun F Zhang W Mahdavi A Arnold F  Tirrell D Synthesis of bioactive protein hydrogels by genetically encoded SpyTag-SpyCatcher chemistry Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111 11269-11274 2014 Figure 1 E coli SpyTag-only biofilm Green fluorescence indicates regions of SpyTag expression on cell surface Hanwei Liu Tirrell group Caltech
