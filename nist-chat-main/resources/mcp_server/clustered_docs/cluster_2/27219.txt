Macromolecular Studies Group Louisiana State University Baton Rouge Louisiana 70803 United States Background and Significance The self-assembly of polymeric materials into one-dimensional 1D nanorods nanoribbons two-dimensional 2D nanosheets or platelets or more complex structures has attracted growing interests due to its potential for biotechnological applications eg drug delivery and biomineralization as well as fundamental polymer physics AB-type diblock copolymers comprised of solvophilic corona-forming segments and crystallizable core-forming segments are the most commonly used structural motif to induce the formation of anisotropic nanostructures in solution by the crystallization-driven self-assembly process CDSA and the morphology of resulting nanostructures strongly depends on the specific polymer composition and the self-assembly pathway With these solvophobic crystalline blocks the molecular exchange is often restricted due to high free energy penalty resulting in kinetically trapped molecular assemblies in an out-of-equilibrium state with a very long lifetime As a result one can access anisotropic polymeric nanostructures with varying morphology by altering the solvent length of the solvophobic crystallizable block and annealing condition Polypeptoids featuring N-substituted polyglycine backbones are structural mimics of polypeptides In contrast to polypeptides polypeptoids exhibit thermal processability enhanced protease stability and good solubility in water and common organic solvents due to the absence of hydrogen bonding and stereogenic centers along the backbone in sharp contrast to polypeptides The cytocompatibility and biodegradability also make polypeptoids an attractive class of peptidomimetic polymers for biomedical and biotechnological applications eg antifouling coatings druggene delivery and biosensor In our recent work we studied the CDSA of coil-comb shaped diblock copolypeptoids namely polyN-methyl glycine-b-polyN-decyl glycine PNMG-b-PNDG in dilute methanol solution by a combination of X-rayneutron scattering and cryo-TEM techniques The effects of chemical composition molecular arrangement and self-assembly pathways on the solution morphology of these coil-comb shaped diblock copolypeptoids have been elucidated Considering the combination of desirable properties of polypeptoids CDSA of coil-comb shaped block copolypeptoids can be used for the further development of new biomaterials and bio-devices with tunable polymer structures and functionalities As an extension of our recent work we now focus on the effect of sidechain chemistry which directly affects the molecular packing and the nature of crystallization on the self-assembly of coil-comb shaped diblock copolypeptoids Two types of diblock copolypeptoids namely polyN-methyl glycine-b-polyN-octyl glycine PNMG-b-PNOG and polyN-methyl glycine-b-polyN-2-ethyl-1-hexyl glycine PNMG-b-PNEHG with varying composition ie NPNMG NPNOGNPNEHG Scheme 1 were synthesized by primary amine-initiated ring-opening polymerization of the corresponding N-substituted glycine derived N-carboxyanhydride monomers Our previous study has demonstrated that the PNEHG homopolymers in the solid state preferentially form a liquid-crystalline LC phase with reduced long-range molecular ordering relative to the crystalline PNOG homopolymer with cis-amide backbone conformation2  The main goal of this proposal is to investigate the structural difference of PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG micelles in dilute methanol or aqueous solution using vSANS By combine with other techniques such as SAXSWAXS and cryo-TEM we aim to investigate the role of sidechain chemistry and crystalline packing on the self-assembled diblock copolypeptoid nanostructures in solution We believe the proposed investigation would shed new light on the rational design and synthesis of non-spherical polymeric self-assemblies with controlled sizes shapes and morphologies in dilute solution The proposed research is also part of the DOE-EPSCoR program DE-SC0012432 aimed at building neutron scattering infrastructure in Louisiana for advanced materials Scheme 1 Chemical structures of PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG Preliminary Work In our preliminary investigation methanol solutions of 5 mgml PNMG107-b-PNOG44 and PNMG109-b-PNEHG47 have been characterized by small-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering SAXSWAXS at room temperature using capillary cells For PNMG116-b-PNOG94 the SAXS profile exhibited different power-law dependence on q with Iq  q-4 at q  0003 -1 and Iq  q-2 at 0003 -1  q  0015 -1 Figure 1 a indicating the presence of hierarchically assembled nanostructures ie 2D building blocks at a smaller length scale that contribute to three-dimensional aggregates at a larger scale The AFM result of PNMG116-b-PNOG94 also show the presence of anisotropic 2D nanosheets that aggregate into giant micron-sized particles Figure 2 By contrast SAXS profile of PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 in the methanol solution exhibited a q-2 behavior at q  001 -1 suggesting the formation of simple 2D nanostructures in the solution Figure 1 a AFM analysis confirmed the formation of large hexagonal-shaped nanosheets Figure 2 The difference in the molecular packing inside of the assembled PNMG116-b-PNOG94 and PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 nanostructures was further revealed by WAXS analysis As shown in Figure 1 b the PNMG116-b-PNOG94 solution shows notable 001 002 and 003 as well as 100 101 and higher order peaks in the WAXS regime which are attributed to the packing of the core-forming PNOG blocks into a previously reported board-like crystalline structure where the backbones are fully extended in an all cis-amide conformation and nearly coplanar with the N-alkyl sidechains splaying on either side of the backbone1- These results suggest that the formation of anisotropic nanosheets is accompanied by the crystallization in the micellar core these nanosheets further assemble into giant 3D aggregates By contrast the WAXS spectra of PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 solution only shows a single scattering peak near q  05 -1 without any higher order peaks indicating the lack of long-range ordering in the molecular packing This single peak corresponds to a characteristic distance of 126  d  2q which is consistent with the separation of adjacent PNEHG backbones by the N-2-ethyl-1-hexyl sidechains We postulated that the PNEHG blocks are packed into a liquid-crystalline LC phase in the methanol solution which is consistent with earlier WAXS and DSC study on PNEHG homopolymer in the solid state These preliminary results clearly indicate that the sidechain chemistry and crystalline packing have significant impact on the hierarchical self-assembly of coil-comb shaped diblock copolypeptoids in solution Considering the nano- to micro-meter size of these hierarchical assemblies we propose to investigate self-assembly of PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG in methanol and water using vSANS which can provide a lower accessible q compared to regular SANS or SAXS Noted that both solutions were first heated to high temperature until the solution become visually clear Figure 3 then slowly cooled to RT to induced self-assembly Yet it is presently unclear what the association state of polymer is at high temperature This cannot be easily investigated by SAXS due to the limitation in conducting high-temperature experiment using the flow-cell setup Thus we would like to conduct high-temperature vSANS measurements to investigate the structural change upon heating and cooling In addition the formation of 1D or 2D nanostructures in water is of significant interests due to the potential uses in biomedical applications We aim to also explore the effects of relative block length polymer concentration and the choice of solvent on the hierarchical self-assembly of PNMG-b-PNOGs and PNMG-b-PNEHGs in dilute solution which can provide useful information on how these parameters affect the solution self-assembly of diblock copolypeptoids Figure 2 AFM height images of the a PNMG116-b-PNOG94 and b PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 methanol solution 1

cooling to RT and b heating to  70 C The self-assembly is fast and can be completed within  20 min after cooling Figure 1 a SAXS and b WAXS profiles of PNMG116-b-PNOG94 blue and PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 red in methanol 5 mgmL-1 measured at room temperature Both solutions were first heated to high temperature until the solution become clear then slowly cooled to RT to induced self-assembly abFurthermore as shown in Table 1 both PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG involve two different blocks with very different SLD contrast towards deuterated methanol d-methanol or D2O under neutron The structural information of the core-forming PNOGPNDG blocks can be highlighted near mid-q regime under vSANS due to a larger SLD contrast between PNOGPNDG and solvent which is very different from SAXS For example the relatively small difference of SLDs between PNOGPNEHG and water under X-ray would lead to a nearly core-contrast-matched condition We believe the combination use of SAXS and vSANS techniques can not only provide additional structural information from lower accessible q and feasible high temperature experiments but also help us to overcome the mathematical difficulty in solving real space structures from reciprocal space measurements The use of neutron scattering can also avoid possible radiation damage of polypeptoids which has been observed under long-time exposure under X-ray Table

Proposed experiments at NCNR We propose to conduct small-angle neutron scattering vSANS experiments at the CHRNS VSANS beamline at NCNR to study the hierarchical structure of PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG self-assemblies in dilute methanol and aqueous solutions with different block lengths and at different temperatures Prior to proposed vSANS experiments all the polymer synthesis sample preparations and initial structural characterizations NMR GPC AFM TEMcryo-TEM will be conducted at Louisiana State University We have already completed the synthesis of eight different polymers with different chemical compositions via the established ring-opening polymerization methods and samples are tabulated in Table 2 All the PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG diblock copolypeptoids in dilute ie 5 mgmL d-methanol and D2O solutions will be first subjected to vSANS measurements at room temperature For PNMG116-b-PNOG94 and PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 in methanol we would like to perform vSANS measurements at 4 different temperature stages below and above the melting point of PNOG and PNEHG in methanol during the heating process plus 1 measurement after cooled back to room temperature We will then select another two PNMG-b-PNOG and PNMG-b-PNEHG samples with similar block ratios in both methanol and D2O for high temperature measurements to investigate the solvent effect The choice of samples will be based the initial data analysis of the vSANS data collected at room temperature In the end we would like to perform vSANS on PNMG116-b-PNOG94 and PNMG121-b-PNEHG101 methanol solutions within a concentration range of 1 - 30 mgmL to investigate the effect of polymer concentration on the hierarchical assembly of diblock copolypeptoids For 5 mgmL solutions each sample measurement will take about 15 hours with a typical q range of  00003 -1 q  06  -1 For samples at T  Tm where the nanostructures may disassemble into unimers or small micelles each sample measurement will be extended to about 25 hours to ensure good statistics Therefore we would like to request a total of 3 days vSANS beamtime in the upcoming cycle We would also like to use the temperature-controlled multi-sample holder and quartz Banjo cells available at the CHRNS VSANS beamline at NCNR if possible All measurements will be conducted according to the standard safety protocol established at NCNR Table 2
