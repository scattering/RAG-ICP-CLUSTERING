Structure Formation in Dense Gels of Cellulose and Ionic Liquid Doug Henderson1 Xin Zhang1 Yimin Mao12 Robert M Briber1 Howard Wang1 1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Maryland College Park MD 2 NCNR NIST Gaithersburg MD Background Molecular cellulose solutions MCS are fabricated by dissolving cellulose in a binary solvent mixture of ionic liquid EMIMAc and dimethylsulfoxide DMSO based on work done in Rein et al1 To create neat cellulose films from solution DMSO is removed with a vacuum oven leaving a dense gel of cellulose and ionic liquid with unique multi-scale ordering EMIMAc is removed by soaking with acetone followed by ethanol and as the cellulose composition increases the structural ordering in the gel changes These solvents have been shown to have different effects on the structure of the gels throughout the soaking process Extensive small and wide angle x-ray scattering SAXS WAXS has been conducted to characterize this structure Figure 1 shows the SAXS data obtained for these gels with increasing cellulose content as EMIMAc is removed A prominent peak is observed at about Q  002 -1 As EMIMAc is removed during acetone washing Figure 1A the peak shifts to a higher Q During ethanol washing Figure 1B the peak shifts slightly to higher Q and intensity increases Figure 1 SAXS data of celluloseEMIMAc gels throughout A acetone soaking process and B ethanol soaking process This peak corresponds to a periodic distance between scattering objects During EMIMAc removal this distance decreases and changes with concentration following a 57  5612 dependence indicating 1-dimensional or rod-like objects These gels are ordered at the local scale with a large peak at 8 degrees d-spacing of about 11 nm As the gel is washed with acetone the peak increases in intensity then as its washed with ethanol the peak collapses These peaks indicate multiscale ordering in these gels The local ordering peak with D  11 nm indicates a potential crystal complex with cellulose and EMIMAc since ordering collapses as EMIMAc is removed The long range ordering 30 nm corresponds to the periodic distance between dense regions containing crystal clusters of the 11 nm scale ordering Acetone likely cannot penetrate the ordered regions so preferentially removes EMIMAc from the amorphous region between clusters resulting in a decrease in periodic distance and a shift to higher Q Ethanol will remove the remaining EMIMAc largely present in ordered regions causing the local ordering to collapse In SAXS the periodic distance does not change significantly however intensity increases This could indicate void formation as the EMIMAc is A B removed however further investigation is required Using small angle neutron scattering SANS and contrast matching we can investigate the presence of voids and probe the structure within the ordered regions by more accurately estimating the composition in each phase Figure 2 below is a schematic illustrating this multi-scale ordering Figure 2 Schematic of multiscale structure in celluloseEMIMAc gel Experiment and Analysis Plan A large cellulose film will be prepared according to the following procedure MSC with 6 cellulose 11 EMIMAc and 83 DMSO Solution will be cast in a large dish and placed in a vacuum oven for 1 week to evaporate DMSO The remaining gel of cellulose and EMIMAc will be soaked repeatedly with Acetone for a total of 5 soakings each 24 hours in length with controlled drying between soaks to limit wrinkling in the film Mass will be monitored throughout soaking and when no change in mass is measured after soaking acetone is no longer an effective solvent Half the film will be removed for contrast matching measurements with acetone The remaining film will then be soaked in ethanol to remove the remaining EMIMAc for a total of 10 soaks each lasting 24 hours with controlled drying between soaks Mass will be monitored throughout the soaking process in order to assert that the final film contains minimal EMIMAc This will be supported by using FTIR measurements The remaining film will be used for contrast matching measurements with ethanol For each of the two samples there are two phases- the amorphous domains and the dense ordered domains Each phase will contain a different composition of EMIMAc and cellulose and thus will have different scattering length densities SLD that can be matched The scattering length densities SLD of the experiment materials are listed in Table 1 When properly matched at the correct ratio of hydrogenated to deuterated solvent fraction HD fraction minimum overall scattering will be observed This can yield information about the compositions of each phase for each film which are unknown Based on previous experiments the cellulose composition of the amorphous phase after full acetone soaking is estimated to be roughly 92 and in the ordered phase roughly 55 Different HD fractions of acetone will be used to match the SLD of this composition as shown in Figure 3 assuming all available protons in the cellulose and EMIMAc are exchanged for deuterium Table 1 Cellulose EMIMAc Ethanol d-Ethanol Acetone d-AcetoneCoh SLD 10-6  176 129 -035 610 027 1642I coh SLD 10-6  2123 1558 1966 306 539 257The gel after ethanol soaking should contain minimal ionic liquid so contrast matching of ethanol will be useful for verifying how much ionic liquid is remaining and where it is located The cellulose composition after full ethanol soaking is likely 95 in the amorphous and 85 in the ordered phase Different HD fractions of ethanol will be used to match this SLD range as shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 Plot of HD fractions vs scattering length densities corresponding to cellulose compositions contained in the phases of the gel 1 Amorphous phase after acetone soak 2 Ordered phase after acetone soak 3 Amorphous phases after ethanol soak 4 Ordered phase after ethanol soak Each of the 4 phase regions will be matched using a range of different HD ratios around the estimated SLD roughly 6 measurements per sample Additionally it is not known how temperature effects the behavior of these solvents during the soaking process Both films will be soaked in pure deuterated acetone or ethanol and will be measured at temperatures up to 55 C for acetone and 75 C for ethanol and monitored for changes in structure during this process The long-range ordering peak will appear between 001 -1Q004 -1 so 13 m configuration will be needed The decay of the peak will be measurable in the 4 m and 1 m configurations Beam Time Request With 4 phase regions and 6 HD ratios measured per sample thats 24 total measurements Additionally each gel soaked in deuterated solvent will undergo a temperature variation measurement Each sample will be measured with 3 configurations The low-Q region contains the structural ordering peak and the high-Q region contains the decay of that peak and a prominent local ordering peak 2 hours will be needed for each measurement with 24 total measurements as well as background solvent measurements Temperature variation measurements will take roughly 12 hours each to measure 5-6 different temperatures to account for equilibration times We request 3 days of beam time on SANS to conduct the proposed experiment Reference 1 Rein Dmitry M et al True molecular solutions of natural cellulose
