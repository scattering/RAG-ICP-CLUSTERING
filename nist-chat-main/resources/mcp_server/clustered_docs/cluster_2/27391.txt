 Polarized neutron scattering has been shown to be a powerful technique for probing the magnetic configurations within and between ferrite nanoparticles12345 Experiments are typically performed on static configurations of particles where the center-to-center spacing is held constant during measurements However advanced biomedical applications of magnetic nanoparticles MNPs often exploit of the nonlinear response in magnetization of particles as they cluster or dynamically change their center-to-center spacing Advanced contrast agents for monitoring neural activity678 and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer therapy9 use this nonlinearity to enhance signal-to-noise and heating effects We propose performing polarized VSANS using a novel sample a soft MNP-polymer composite in order to study the magnetic correlation between particles as their average spacing is varied continuously Soft polymer composites are useful because their low Youngs modulus enables their shape to be reconfigured easily under applied stress The macroscopic change in shape is accompanied by deformation on the nanoscale where polymer chains stretch and translate to accommodate a new equilibrium configuration Magnetic nanoparticles embedded in such a polymer matrix will also change their configuration as a function of applied stress providing a means to continuously adjust the average center-to-center spacing of an ensemble of nanoparticles MNP-polymer composites can be easily prepared with engineered magnetic and mechanical properties In particular we propose study of a polyethylene glycoliron oxide based composite prepared using in-situ coprecipitation of nanoparticles10 During this process the PEG gel is first crosslinked and then used as a reaction matrix for the nucleation and growth of magnetic nanoparticles Figure 1a This synthetic approach offers control over several experimental parameters of interest - gel stiffness density of magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticle diameter Gel stiffness can be changed by nearly an order of magnitude 10-70 kPa by adjusting the initial molecular weight or concentration of the PEG monomer1112 The density of magnetic nanoparticles can be changed by adjusting the concentration of iron salt precursor used at the beginning of the reaction Figure 1b Diameter of magnetic nanoparticles can be tuned by adjusting the molecular weight of PEG monomer used for the gel since the growth stage of nanoparticles is sterically limited by the pore size of the hydrogel This can be seen in the peaks of ZFC-FC measurements performed on composites made with different molecular weights Figure 2a The particles embedded in the polymer matrix are superparamagnetic showing a characteristic Langevin function in the hysteresis loop at room temperature Figure 2b Particle sizes can be easily tuned from 5-15 nm and particle concentration from 1-5 by volume Focusing on samples containing 50 mg of iron oxide nanoparticles each we propose using VSANS with full neutron spin polarization analysis to study two composites containing 8 nm and 15 nm nanoparticles Each will be measured in their native unstretched configurations at 0005 T and 15 T to detect nanoparticle-to-nanoparticle correlations and the degree of spin canting in the presence of a nearly saturating magnetic field The two samples will then be stretched by factors of  15 and then 30 along the applied magnetic field direction Measurements at 0005 T and 15 T will again be performed focusing on the higher field regime if time runs short A counting time of 75 hours 2 hours non spin-flip 5 hours spin-flip 05 hours of related polarization characterizing transmissions per condition x 12  375 days allowing 6 hours for beam line set-up samples changes and alignments in a 4 day experiment These measurements can be carried out in a single shot at 55  with 4 guides and front  middle detector distances of 4 m and 17 m in order to cover the Q-range of 0003 to 013 inverse angstroms at VSANS In conclusion the proposed SANS investigation of a sample with reconfigurable MNP spacing would enable fundamental understanding of the magnetic configurations of continuous spatial variation in MNP ensembles Moreover polarized neutron scattering is an ideal candidate for probing this experimental system because it can simultaneously probe magnetic and structural changes in a stressed MNP-polymer composite Figure 1 a Schematic of in-situ coprecipitation process The hydrogel network is first soaked in iron II III salt solution Then the network is immersed in an alkaline solution Ferrous Fe2 and ferric Fe3 are not soluble at high pH reaction performed at pH 13 The iron cations precipitate out of solution causing nucleation and growth of iron oxide nanoparticles throughout the gel b Gels show at different stages of reaction top and gels with varying density of iron oxide nanoparticles Figure 2 Magnetic measurements a Zero field cooled and field cooled measurements performed on MNP-polymer composites with two different molecular weights 1000 and 8000 The change in molecular weight can be used to change particle size from 5 to 10 nm b
