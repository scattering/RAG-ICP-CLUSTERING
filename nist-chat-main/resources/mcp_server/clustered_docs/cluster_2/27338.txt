Background I Biologically relevant interfacial system Lung surfactants are essential to increase lung compliance for the ease of breathing These lung surfactants which consist of a complex mixture of lipids and surfactant associated proteins form a monolayer at the air-water interface of the alveoli to stabilize lung functions1 2 On the one hand neonatal respiratory distress syndrome NRDS a common disease in premature infants arises when infants have not reached the developed stage of producing lung surfactants Consequently NRDS causes breathing problems in these infants and is currently resolved by the administration of synthetic and natural lung surfactants as temporary therapeutic aids During the instillation process of synthetic lung surfactants the spreading occurs within minutes3 which suggests a low interfacial viscosity is needed for this ease of spreading On the other hand acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS which occurs in adults due to injuries to the lung tissue causes collapse of the alveoli and is influenced by stress factors such as inhaling toxic substances Minimal advancement has been made to improve these therapeutic surfactant treatments due to a lack of fundamental understanding of natural lung surfactant mechanisms Therefore it is critical to understand the function of lung surfactants and their collapse mechanism for the stabilization of the fluid layers in the alveoli The main compound in lung surfactants is 12-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine DPPC It is established that upon compression the phase behavior of DPPC at the air-water interface goes through a gaseous phase and then a coexisting liquid expanded and chiral liquid condensed phase where the rheological responses in these phases are primarily viscous However high discrepancies in results have been reported for highly compressed regions of DPPC often described as the solid phase Discrepancies have been reported as to whether DPPC behaves as a viscoelastic gel4 or a purely viscous fluid under similar conditions5 Recently Hermans et al studied DPPC under physiological conditions including a larger range of surface pressures and temperatures to create a reproducible monolayer at the air-water interface They discovered that increasing the surface pressure would increase the elasticity of the monolayer and indirectly showed that this monolayer had a shear sensitive microstructure through various pre-shear protocols using a Langmuir trough and stress-controlled rheometer hybrid6 Kim et al corroborated these results through interfacial microrheology where high compressions indicated higher interfacial viscosity and higher elasticity7 Due to the shear sensitivity of these interfaces we hypothesize that structures at high compression which are susceptible to over compressing to multilayers can reach a metastable state due to monolayer preparation and processing In turn these non-equilibrium states can result in vastly different rheological behaviors of the interface A better understanding of the structure of DPPC at high interfacial compression region can elucidate these structure-property relationships This is a first step in further understanding the effect of stress factors on these phospholipid layers Structural information under relevant conditions is completely missing and this work could open a new route for studying the fundamentals behind NRDS and ARDS which both have important implications II Type of interfacial compressions to understand dilatational behavior Mixed flow and deformation fields in traditional Langmuir troughs due to anisotropic compression tend to convolute the data interpretation of dilatational rheology at the interface in the presence of interfacial systems with both finite surface shear and dilatational elasticity or G and K respectively Petkov et al proposed a method to resolve the surface shear and dilatational elasticity through orienting the Wilhelmy plate perpendicular and parallel to the moving barriers of the trough which result in different surface pressure extractions that are orthogonal  and parallel  to barrier compression Eq 1a-c 8 1a 1b 1c is defined as the static surface tension which is a thermodynamic response as a function of surface concentration  is the relative area change with respect to a shear stress free area  usually defined as the beginning of an onset in surface pressure This analysis by Petkov is limited to very small strains Additionally the anisotropic state is not as easily deconvoluted in the deformation field due to coupling of shear and dilatational flows and to the difficulty of accurate plate orientation Furthermore for viscoelastic interfaces fluids which can be improperly labeled as inviscid it is unclear how these deform structurally under these mixed flows A new analysis introduced by Pepicelli et al has the capability of dealing with large deformations and are discussed elsewhere9 With the combination of this new analysis and a homogeneous compression which are capabilities of the radial trough and Quadrotrough we eliminate this mixed flow behavior and a pure dilatational elasticity can be determined Aim We aim to probe the structural states of DPPC at the air-water interface under pure compression and under shear influence using rheo-MAGIK which is a modified Langmuir trough sample environment Quadrotrough on a horizontally modified MAGIK neutron reflectometer For comparison purposes we also propose to probe the structural states of DPPC at the air-water interface under uniaxial compression with mixed deformation flows using the traditional Langmuir trough setup on the NG7 neutron reflectometer The combination of these two experiments will elucidate how processing of the interface affects the out-of-plane structures at the air-water interface Furthermore we can explore the path dependent phase behavior of DPPC by systematically alternating pure compression and pure shear protocols via rheo-MAGIK Preliminary Work Figure 1 shows a surface pressure area compression curve of DPPC at 25 C measured in a rectangular Langmuir trough with two Wilhelmy plates in different orientations with respect to the moving barriers This experiment resulted in equal surface pressure isotherms between the two Wilhelmy plate orientation over the whole compression range which seems to suggest no shear elasticity of DPPC Eq 18 While this experiment suggests that the DPPC interface is purely viscous throughout all compressions we suspect that the instrument resolution of the Wilhelmy plate and Langmuir trough is not able to detect the low shear moduli such as that reported by Hermans et al6 However with any form of viscoelastic interface we should still be able to detect structural differences under isotropic and anisotropic compression with the Quadrotrough and Langmuir trough respectively Second we intend to investigate the transient regime observed at high compression ratios which as yet is largely unexplored Figure 1 Left Surface pressure p as function of mean molecular area MMA of DPPC at the water-air interface measured with two Wilhelmy plates parallel and orthogonal to the barrier at 25 C The interface is prepared as described in 6 and compression speed is 10 mmmin 92 2molecule per min Right Setup of the two Wilhelmy plates in the Langmuir trough Experimental Plan rheo-MAGIK We propose to study deuterated DPPC SLD -2 at the air-water interface at two compressions in each region of the isotherm gaseous liquid condensed and liquid expanded and solid region We also propose to shear at two different strains in the solid region This totals to nine experiments including one control The experiment will be done at 25  C in the Quadrotrough Each compression needs roughly one hour to equilibrate the interface post-relaxation Each compression will also require eight hours of beamtime to access a Q-range of 001 to 02 A-1 Because rheo-MAGIK is still in beta testing a full day is necessary for alignment and sample environment set up We request a total of five days for beamtime to complete the experiment This work is of importance to the doctoral thesis of Damian Renggli and anticipate the results will be published in a high-impact journal due to its relevance pertaining to a novel structure-property relationship findings Experimental Plan NG7 with Langmuir trough setup This experimental plan is similar to that of rheo-MAGIK but no pure shearing is performed Therefore it totals to seven experiments including one control We request a total of four days necessary to complete this experiment References 1 O Blorgey P Tchoreloff J J Benattar J E Proust J Colloid Interface Sci 146 373-381 1991 2 E Hermans M
