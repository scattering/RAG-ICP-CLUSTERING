New insights into colloidal phase transitions using VSANS 1 New insights into colloidal phase transitions using VSANS Significance Despite enormous progress in recent years in understanding phase transition in colloidal suspensions key elements are still missing from our understanding of metastability supercooling and the glass transition In particular there is still no clear understanding of the effects of polydispersity although studies of both polydisperse and binary mixtures of hard sphere colloids have been performed a systematic study of the effects of polydispersity on structure crystallisation kinetics and particle dynamics is still lacking Such a study has the potential to reveal quantitative information about the causes of metastability and inform our attempts to model it This lack is partly because it is difficult to control polydispersity and partly because experimental techniques needed to measure the partial structures are lacking Long term aims To conduct a systematic study of the kinetics of solidification both crystallization and glass formation in marginal binary mixtures of colloidal hard sphere suspensions using VSANS This will include using appropriate mixtures of deuteratednon-deuterated particles and solvent to measure both the total and partial structure factors of binary mixtures as functions of time during crystallization and glass formation to obtain detailed kinetics of each of the components Aim for this experiment our previous SANS studies have shown that the q resolution is not good enough to reliably extract quantitative data about crystallization especially at short times following the quench In this experiment we will test the resolution limits of the new VSANS instrument which will enable us to plan a future a comprehensive study of these effects Scientific Background Recent advances in our understanding of the dynamics of solidification into both the crystalline and glassy states in colloidal systems are cause for optimism that a full understanding of metastability supercooling and solidification processes is within reach These advances include  Application of mode coupling theory MCT to the supercooled liquid state leading to a quantitative description of structural arrest in hard-sphere glasses   Prediction of the exponents of stretched exponential decays for structural relaxation in supercooled liquids and glasses   Increasing understanding of the role of dynamic heterogeneity in supercooled fluids and characterization of dynamic heterogeneity in terms of dynamic correlation lengths   Refinement of classical nucleation theory clarification of the role of each of its parameters and an improved understanding of its limitations   Proof of the existence of residual stress in inherent structures which is held responsible for the slow viscous relaxation of supercooled liquids and glasses   High precision measurements of the crystallization kinetics of hard sphere colloidal dispersions at different levels of polydispersity revealing the strong dependence of the crystallization induction time on polydispersity   The discovery of new non-diffusive relaxation mechanisms in the intermediate scattering function of hard sphere colloidal fluids that change qualitatively as the freezing line is crossed and also at the approach to the glass transition  Despite these advances each new development raises additional questions We have conducted an extensive study of particle dynamics in hard sphere systems using Dynamic Light Scattering DLS techniques with a focus on the metastable and glassy phases eg 7-1 In parallel we have conducted visible light Bragg scattering measurements of crystallisation eg  However light scattering requires compromises to reduce multiple scattering Modern neutron scattering techniques have the potential to be a powerful tool for fundamental investigations of phase transition kinetics and particle dynamics in concentrated colloidal suspensions While some pioneering work in this area was carried out using neutron scattering 12-1 there has been relatively little work in this area over the past 2 decades Deuterated MMA and decalin the solvent of choice for these studies are available commercially and the methods for making New insights into colloidal phase transitions using VSANS 2 the deuterated particles are established 1 The proposed research takes advantage of the unique nature of neutrons to answer important questions about the nature of metastability crystallization and the glass transition and will provide a significant advance on our current understanding of these processes Previous work Figure 1 shows typical crystallization data observed using SANS Quokka ANSTO Sydney Samples are initially in the fluid metastable state following the quench yielding a fluid structure factor blue line Crystallization occurs over long times determined by the level of polydispersity the main crystallization peak around q  3x10-3 -1 The growth of the crystal peaks is extracted by subtracting each successive data set from the initial fluid scattering curve and the results are shown in the inset which shows the peak growing with time As can be seen the peak is essentially defined by 4 points limited by the pixel and wavelength resolution of the instrument Figure 1 shows the scattering curves for SMU39 at a volume fraction of 054 over a period of 250 minutes following the quench The inset highlights the growth of the main crystalline peak with Gaussian fits In principle the crystallinity  the fraction of the sample which is crystalline is determined by integrating over the area of the main Bragg reflection 1- where c is obtained after normalizing to the value obtained from the equilibrium phase diagram This quantity is shown in figure 2 left which exhibits an almost linear growth in the amount of crystal until the entire sample is crystalline when there is a slight slowdown on the last point measured At early times there is a hint of a deviation from linear however the small number of points in the peak means we cannot measure the short time behavior We also calculate the average crystal size as a function of time from where K10747 is the Scherrer constant for a spherical crystal is shown in units of the particle radius in figure 2 right The growth in crystal size can only be determine for later times with too much noise at early times due to the small number of points defining the crystal peaks Figure 2 left the fraction of crystal in the sample as a function of time

insights into colloidal phase transitions using VSANS 3 Description of the experiments to be carried out In this initial study we will repeat the experiments carried out on QUOKKA to determine the resolution limits of the new VSANS instruments using the high resolution option Q resolution  2 These samples scatter very strongly and the reduced flux at high resolution should not be an issue for these experiments On Quokka the average measurement time was 3 minutes for this data - clearly this will be longer in the high resolution mode so we sacrifice some time resolution in order to gain spatial resolution Each experiment will take  6 hours Note that we will only need to use one camera length around the main structure factor peak for most measurements We plan to run 16 samples volume fractions in the range 050-056 with different polydispersities With setup changeover and troubleshooting we request 4 days of instrument time This work will form a critical component of the PhD of
