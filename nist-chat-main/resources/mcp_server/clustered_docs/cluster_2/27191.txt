 Shear Alignment and Relaxation Behavior of Amphiphilic Block CopolymerOilWater Mesophases 1 Shear Alignment and Relaxation Behavior of Amphiphilic Block CopolymerOilWater Mesophases PI Reza Foudazi Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering New Mexico State University Las Cruces NM 88003 USA Introduction Amphiphilic block copolymers self-assemble at the wateroil interface to form different mesomorphic structures also known as mesophases or lyotropic liquid crystals LLCs such as lamellar micellar cubic normal hexagonal and reverse hexagonal structures1 The mesophases have the length scale in the range of 2-50 nm Recently we have shown that ultrafiltration membranes for water treatment with pore size on the order of 5 nm can be obtained through mesophase templating method2 In mesophase templating a monomer is incorporated in the oil phase and is polymerized after coating the mesophase on a substrate2 We have also studied the polymerization of mesophase templates by using chemorheology3 Our goal is to enhance the performance of mesophase-templated membranes through alignment Our rheological studies show that the viscoelastic behavior of mesophases changes under high deformations However in situ structural analysis such as rheo-SANS is required to investigate the evolution of structure structure-processability relationship and orientation of mesophases under shear Preliminary Results The flow behavior of mesophases is dependent on the rearrangement of micelles and grains The decrease of elastic modulus by strain has been observed in lamellar and hexagonal mesophases4 We propose that different factors including the presence of defects such as vacancies dislocations and grain boundaries see Fig 1a their elimination as a result of shear flow and their re-formation at rest over a long period contribute to the behavior of the system under shear deformation In 1 Alexandridis P Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci 1 490-501 1996 2 Qavi S Lindsay A Firestone

elastic modulus does not relax back to its original state However the presence of defects with very long relaxation times can be misleading in the interpretation of the decrease in elastic modulus of systems with alignment5 In order to evaluate the stability and relaxation behavior of aligned mesophases we have done a series of experiments We have reported6 that applying large amplitude oscillatory shear LAOS strains on the mesophases decreases the storage modulus in the whole frequency range and decreases the loss modulus in small-frequency regime with negligible effect at high frequencies Fig 1b The observed behavior can be attributed to the alignment of mesophases One may argue that alignment is thermodynamically favorable so it should remain after being induced However the rheological analysis shows that the decrease in moduli after applying high strains is reversible and the system relaxes back to its original elastic modulus at rest Fig 1c The rheo-SANS studies will reveal the structural evolution not only during the high shear deformation but also during the relaxation process We have studied self-assembled lamellar mesostructures of Pluronic P84 in the presence of deuterated water D2O and p-xylene by rheo-SANS at NIST Simple shear measurements were done in radial direction using a detector at 25 m distance mid q-range with a 28 mm titanium bob and cup geometry This preliminary rheo-SANS results suggest that lamellar mesophases orient in the direction of flow and form a perfectly oriented structure6 Fig 2a shows the SANS data obtained for lamellar mesophases of Pluronic P84D2Op-xylene 40175425 composition in steady state simple shear test at different shear rates Fig 2b suggests that the mesophase structure becomes strongly aligned at shear rates higher than 01 s-1 Research Gap Current data shows that lamellar mesophases align by shear and form a highly aligned structure This finding can be utilized for making ordered structures using sufficiently high shear strains However preliminary results Fig 1 suggest that mesophases relax to their original state over 5 Doi M Harden JL Ohta T Macromolecules 26 4935-4944 1993 Hahn H Joon

Therefore further investigations are required to analyze the structure during relaxation and the driving force for this relaxation process Additionally shear alignment and relaxation behavior of normal and reverse hexagonal and cubic mesophases of Pluronic block copolymeroilwater can reveal how the mesostructure influences the alignmentformation of single crystal upon shear deformation and consequent relaxation If we want to exploit the alignment in membrane fabrication the mesophases should be polymerized after high deformations Our chemorheological studies on mesophases show that the induction period of polymerization is about 10 min and the polymerization is complete in about 25 min at 60 C3 Increasing the temperature to 70 C will almost halve these durations The relaxation experiments after LAOS deformation shows that samples only slightly relax after 10 min and the complete relaxation requires over 600 min Therefore we suggest that the structure of samples can be retained to a great extent by polymerization after high deformation However we also need to investigate if the polymerization changes the structure Research Methodology The objectives of this work are 1 to study the structural evolution of mesophases during rest after applying different shear histories to shed light on the alignmentrelaxation behavior and 2 to determine how the polymerization affect the aligned structure In this work we will use Pluronic P84 as reference block copolymer in D2Omonomer mixtures We will study two systems with composition of PluronicD2Omonomer wt 601525 and 403525 which have lamellar and reverse hexagonal structures as confirmed with lab scale small-angle X-ray scattering SAXS instrument respectively3 Monomer phase contain butyl acrylate ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and azobisisobutyronitrile initiator Samples will be prepared at New Mexico State University NMSU Two sets of experiment will be done with simultaneous SANS measurements i alignment and relaxation of mesophases after applying LAOS deformations and ii polymerization of mesophases with different degrees of alignment To have a complete picture of underlying microstructural changes during shear deformation and relaxation we will use very small-angle neutron scattering VSANS with the rheometer to provide 2 orders of magnitude in q-range 0004 to 04 -1 for resolving the mesostructural changes during deformation stress relaxation and polymerization at different length scales We will only make measurements through the radial flow-vorticity plane in this work As the sample has a very high H versus D content we expect the transmission through the tangential direction will be very low long path length 10 mm to have feasible scattering through this plane For alignment and relaxation experiments we will apply LAOS deformations at two different strains of 5 and 50 for 300 min followed by 300 min relaxation time A total of 40 hours is required to measure structural evolution during deformation and relaxation Measurements will be done at room temperature and the initiator will be excluded to avoid any polymerization We will make these long measurements using event mode and split the resulting file into appropriate time bins 3 min to study the evolution of structures as they align and relax For the alignment and polymerization experiments each sample will be aligned for different durations of time tentatively 10 30 60 and 180 min at room temperature before the temperature is quickly increased to 70 C for polymerization and tracked over a period of 1-2 hours The unaligned sample will also be studied as control Additional control experiments will be performed on samples without the initiator to track possible effect of temperature rise on the relaxation We will use event mode and split the resulting file into appropriate time bins to study the evolution of structures during polymerization We request 3 days on the VSANS instrument to complete the experiment as described
