Tuning self-assembly of block copolymers BCPs via low strength magnetic fields Scientific Significance BCPs are promising materials for many applications as material functionality symmetry of the self-assembled structure and characteristic dimension can be tuned via individual block properties However practical methods for BCP processing with controlled grain size and orientation are still challenging Orientation control can be achieved by shear and electric fields but these methods challenge the stability of polymer matrix or limit uniform orientation to only a few periodicities in thickness1 Additionally perpendicular or vertical alignment of BCP domains in thin films is extremely difficult to achieve on larger length scales2 The space-pervasive nature and non-contact application of magnetic fields makes magnetic field-induced directed self-assembly MDSA a promising method to overcome these challenges The driving force for magnetic field alignment is the angle dependent magnetization energy of the system which originates from the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy  of the self-assembled BCP structure all polymers have magnetic anisotropy in chain segments shorter than the persistence length3 MDSA has been demonstrated in BCPs however previous work has required large field strengths B5 T the addition of liquid-crystalline LC blocks rod-like blocks or aromatic rings to facilitate ordering substantial chain anisotropy or combinations therein to achieve field-induced orientation4-7 BCP ordering upon application of low-strength fields B05 T has only been reported in systems of over 60 wt LC mesogen by mass8 We recently discovered anomalous behavior upon application of low-strength magnetic fields in commercially available triblock poloxamers also known as Pluronics Here a transition from liquid to soft solid state is observed upon field application The triblocks contain hydrophilic polyethylene oxide PEO end blocks and hydrophobic polypropylene oxide PPO midblocks and self-assemble in aqueous conditions into micelles cubic hexagonal and lamellar phases among others These anomalous structural and rheological responses are seen at field strengths B03T over an order of magnitude below previously observed responses and the predicted behavior based on  of the blocks or the self-assembled structure Further elemental analysis has confirmed the Pluronics are free from para- or ferromagnetic traces Accordingly understanding this novel directed-assembly mechanism is of significant scientific interest for its potential to enhance assembly with minimal input from external fields and the potential to discover new structures not accessible through traditional self-assembly routes The goal of this proposal is to characterize the formed domain structures and structure formation kinetics during MDSA providing a microstructural basis for the observed rheological behavior System characterization MDSA characterization has focused on 20 aqueous solutions of six poloxamers L64 P84 P104 L101 P123 F127 to elucidate the impact of molecular weight block length of PPO and PEO and block ratio The field-inducted transition is measured via the magneto-rheometry MR attachment from Anton Paar Structural transitions are reversible at long times when G104 Pa Fig 1a only partial or slow relaxation is observed when G104 Pa confirmed via SAXS Rheology is reproducible between sample preparations polymer batch and supplier Field-induced responses were also verified for BCPs in D2O Fig 1b Representative frequency sweeps of P104 with and without applied field are shown in Fig 1c where the elastic modulus G at 20C increases by four to six orders with field application across the measured frequencies As seen in Fig 1 ab  d the response is not instantaneous and requires an induction time similar in length to that observed in LCs These effects are unlikely caused by the ionic environment as Fig 1d confirms that substantial salt addition does not eliminate the transition We have recently shown that adding 2M brine to P104 solutions induces structural changes including micellar growth and a wormlike transition near 60 C which may explain the delayed onset of the transition in the presence of salt shown in Fig 1d As such the ionic effect on the response is likely primarily due to changes in the polymer self-assembly induced by salt Previous SANSSAXS Benchtop experiments of F127 and P123 on magnets of various strengths confirm that gelation occurs in the presence of magnetic field MR benchtop and preliminary in situ SAXS and SANS measurements Fig 2e-f indicate that the induction time and resulting structure depend on field strength and confirm that the magnetic response is not an artifact of the MR device geometrical confinement or sample drying Benchtop experiments were reproduced and gels were measured via in-house SAXS following magnet removal Fig 2a-d Significant anisotropy in F127 Fig 2d and substantially different structures in both P123 and F127 Fig 2bd respectively were observed vs the control samples Fig 2ac However due to the long acquisition times for in-house SAXS the sample structure may substantially relax during measurement In situ SANS on F127 shows that orientation can be controlled with field direction using different custom SANS cells Fig 2 Field with strong x-components cell C3 C3 is C2 with only one Nd ring magnet leads to maximum intensity in the x-direction field containing strong x- and z-components C2 Fig2 leads to maximum q intensity at 110o These results suggest at least two distinct types of field-induced structure formation motivating the current proposal In the first as in F127 the sample is near a temperature or concentration phase boundary when the magnetic transition is observed In this case field application may induce the phase 05k10k101103 G GB03 T B00 T G G Pat s20 wt L10110-210-110010110-3101105 G GB03 T B00 T G G Pa rads-20 wt P10402k4k10-2101104

following magnet exposure F127 orientation can be controlled by cell type C2e C3f transition and increase ordering in a particular direction similar to shear-induced phase transitions in BCPs However in the second as in P123 P84 and P104 the anomalous behavior is seen far from the phase boundaries reported in literature and confirmed by our rheology and SANS measurements our preliminary SANS measurements suggest micellar growth may be induced by field application Block length and molecular weight effects also appear substantial While self-assembled structures form in all samples initial results indicate that a minimum molecular weight and PPO block length are required for a large field-induced transition to result Such increased ordering under magnetic fields with increasing molecular weight has been previously observed in BCPs of similar size9 Proposed experiments Insitu SANS experiments will be performed on the six Pluronics 20 in D2O using the four custom cells described below and in Fig 2 at 20 C unless noted Transmission measurements will be taken during multiple time points during each experiment to help determine the orientation of the plane or other structure zero-orientation transmission and scattering will be taken during the induction time to provide a baseline Only one configuration 2m6A3 guides 001q025 A-1 is needed for kinetic measurements 20k countss based on prior SANS A high-q configuration will be used for select experiments 1m offset6A8 guides when significant anisotropy may change the number of scatterers per unit volume and hence the incoherent background In-house Matlab algorithms that increase data fitting speeds for core-shell form factors with complex structure factors will be used to fit the data While SAXS does not provide the necessary contrast and may damage samples during long kinetic measurements SANS paired with these fitting methods will allow us to determine changes in micelle dimension core shell length aggregation number solvent penetration and chain extension among other parameters during magnetization As the 20 samples form spherical micelles in the absence of field at 20 C providing little magnetic anisotropy by which to explain this behavior this fitting approach will help elucidate the structural mechanisms leading to the anomalous response In cell 1 C1 Fig 2 Nd magnets are attached

performed for the 6 samples for slightly longer times due to the weaker field 16h As our time estimates incorporate time to change configuration we request 4 days of SANS time References  J Phys
