Page 1 of 3 Shape-Controlled Nanostructures in Templated Polymerization Chung-Hao Liu Kuo-Chih Shih and Mu-Ping Nieh Polymer Program Institute of Materials Science University of Connecticut Storrs CT 06269 USA Scientific Importance Emulsion polymerization was first used for the synthesis of rubbers from 13-butadiene and styrene in order to achieve high molecular weight for the fast reaction 1  With advanced knowledge about self-assembly researchers have been using surfactants to stabilize microemulsion yielding different morphology Since the oil phase of microemulsion can entrap monomers and confine the polymerization in such nano-reactors it is anticipated that polymer nanostructures with well-defined dimensions are attainable using microemulsion as template 3  However several challenges of this approach remain to be overcome Firstly the final morphology of the microemulsion is very sensitive to the ratio of wateroilsurfactant due to the variation of spontaneous curvature at the minimum energy The addition of monomers and crosslinkers can significantly change the energy landscape of the pristine microemulsion resulting in ill-control of the final morphology Secondly the heat release from polymerization likely affects the structure of microemulsion causing unexpected outcome Thirdly complete removal of the residual of oilsurfactant templates without affecting the polymer nanostructures cannot be dismissed We have many years of research experience in controlling uniform lipid self-assemblies One example is the discoidal bicellar system which is composed of long-chain L and short-chain S lipids with a range of molar ratios 2  Lon Shor  52 5  The formation mechanism of nanodiscs is attributed to the hydrophobic interaction segregation of S from L lipid and appropriate molecular spontaneous curvatures of the two one planar and the other rim Tekobo et al used styrene and divinylbenzene as monomers and crosslinkers respectively to conduct polymerization of styrene inside bicelles  With a styrene-to-lipid ratio of 046 polystyrene PS discs can be obtained after the templated polymerization A molecular dynamic simulation indicates energy-favorable encapsulation of hydrophobic Au-clusters into the bicelles rim which is mostly composed of the fluidic S lipids  The same is expected for styrene monomers We hypothesize that by tuning the monomer-to-lipid it is possible to control the morphology of the polymer nanoparticles NPs from disc to ring Due to the high uniformity of lipid nanodiscs reported previously  polymer discs or rings of well-defined sizes are presumably achievable The knowledge will advance our fundamental understanding about templated polymerization which can be further applied to designing shape-controllable polymers at nanoscale Note that PS is only used as a model polymer for the templated polymerization which is anticipated to be a generalized platform for other hydrophobic polymers SANS is a powerful tool to characterize the PS structure and relative location in lipid membrane if the contrast of neutron scattering length densities NSLDs between PS and lipid is sufficient The high contrast can be easily achieved using deuterated styrene in proteated lipids in a well-defined core-shell discoidal model Preliminary Work 1 Structure of styrene encapsulated Bicelles and PS before and after Polymerization Bicelles were prepared in a mixture of long-chain 12-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine DPPC 12-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-1-rac-glycerol DPPG and short-chain 12-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine DHPC with a Q defined as 55555F55_5a  575C5C5575C5C55755C5 value of 3 and R defined as 575C5C5575C5C5575C5C5 value of 005 The monomer-to-lipid ratio was 150 Small angel X-ray scattering SAXS data of pristine bicelles styrene-contained bicelles prior to and after UV-polymerization are shown in Fig 1a revealing almost identical scattering patterns where three high q  01  -1 broad peaks corresponding to the bilayer internal structure are observed This outcome reflects the invariant structure after styrene encapsulation and polymerization The low-q peak located at q  0012  -1 presumably originates from the structure factor ie the interaction between bicelles due to the fact that high lipid concertation is required to yield sufficient intensity in SAXS measurement because of low contrast Moreover the electron density of styrene 915  10-6  -2 is very close to the lipids 92  10-6  -2 resulting in low contrast between the two Therefore SAXS cannot resolve the structure and location of PS in the nanodiscs Transmission electron microscopy TEM is a complementary tool to characterize the nanostructures As many published reports nanodiscs of a uniform radius around 10  15 nm are observed in the pristine bicelles Fig 1 b Fig 1 c and 1d also show similar discoidal morphology of styrene-encapsulated bicelles before and after polymerization consistent with the invariant SAXS data among these samples Sonication in methanol bath followed by centrifugation was performed on the polymerized styrenebicelle system to dissociate the phospholipid from PS The TEM of the solution Fig 1e shows the intriguing outcome of dark circles implicative of PS rings However the ring-like structure is a projected 2-D image from 3-D and might be misinterpreted Moreover it is not certain whether the few NPs in the TEM Page 2 of 3 Figure 3 Simulated scattering data of pristine bicelles red bicelles with deuterated styrene at the bilayer core blue or at the rim green respectively based on with a core shell discoidal model q  -1 Intensity cm-1 image are representative for the whole system As a result formation of nano-rings is likely but not conclusive at this point SANS experiment for deuterated PS in proteated lipids will definitely provide unambiguous answer Figure 1 a The SAXS data for pristine bicelles before and after polymerization The TEM images for b pristine bicelles c before and d after polymerization e After sonication in methanol bath and centrifuged 2 Controlling the ring size The size of bicelles can be controlled by annealing the samples at different temperature over a period of time Fig 2 shows the hydrodynamic radius RH of samples with 10 wt of lipid concentration annealed at 4 and 25 oC respectively measured by dynamic light scattering DLS as a function of time It is clear that bicelles grow faster and larger at higher temperature However it takes  100 hours for the disc to double the size at 25 oC More experiment at high temperature is needed to accelerate the growth rate Another possible way of increasing the size of bicelles is through the enhancement of salinity1 Choice of Instrument We proposed to use either NGB 30m SANS or vSANS to probe the morphology of PS The scattering profile can be simulated based on a core-shell discoidal model where rim and shell are approximated to be identical in thickness and NSLD1 For pristine bicelles in the absence of styrene the core radius shellrim thickness and core thickness has been reported to be 130 10 and 35   respectively and the reported NSLDs of core is -43 x 10-7  -21 It should be noted that the shell and rim NSLD strongly depend on the NSLD of water due to the hydration of the headgroup Here we choose contrast matched CM water ie 12 D2O 88 H2O as the solvent for two reasons greater enhancement in intensity and elimination of structure factor The rim NSLD is then estimated to be 9 x 10-7  -2 The simulated SANS pattern of the pristine bicelle is shown in Fig 3 After encapsulation of deuterated styrene two possible scenarios are considered 1 the styrene monomers located at the rim of the discs or 2 the styrene homogeneously dispersed in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer The former will lead to NSLD difference between the shell and the rim resulting in an enhanced rim NSLD of 98 x 10-7  -2 In scenario 2 the NSLD of bilayer core is expected to increase to -37 x 10-7  -2 The simulated SANS curves of both scenarios are distinct enough for us to resolve the location of PS in the nanodiscs shown in Fig 3 It should also be noted that the simulated outcomes using D2O are not differentiable for the three cases Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We proposed the following experiments After

after polymerization We will prepare the samples with different styrened8-to-lipid ratios of 0 1100 150 120 110 and 15 respectively at a lipid concentration of 100 wt with Q  3 and R  005 The CM water with D2OH2O  1288 will be used as the solvent SANS will be performed on individual samples before and after polymerization in D2O solution except for the sample of styrene-to-lipid ratio  1 There are 11 samples in total The measurement of each sample is expected to take 45  5 hours because of the CM condition and thinner path length to minimize the multiple scattering due to high hydrogen content We estimate the total data collection time will be 50  60 hours Core-shell discoidal model will be used for data analysis as shown in Fig 3 The structure factor will not affect the scattering outcome because the samples are at CM condition 2 Confirmation of the ring structures The sample of styreneh8-to-lipid ratio  150 will be prepared in a 01 wt of lipids concentration condition in D2O The samples will be incubated at 25 C for 0 24 50 and 150 hours at home institute and polymerized at 4 C yielding the PS entrapped bicelles of different sizes SANS measurements will be conducted on all samples Each will take 1 hour 4 hours in total The samples will then undergo the lipid dissociation treatment completely dried followed by re-dispersion in deuterated methanol through sonication The data collection time for the four samples in deuterated methanol is estimated to be 8 hours It would be 12 hours in total for this session The data will be analyzed by the same core-shell discoidal model To complete the proposed experiment we request 3 days of SANS beamtime Response to Previous Panel NA Safety Considerations All the samples will be prepared at the proposers home institute The styrene-d8 are classified as flammable liquids but with high boiling point 145 C Besides the methanol samples are classified as flammable and toxic lipids with boiling point 65 C We will keep the bicelles with styrene and methanol samples at 4 C and all the samples are measured under 35 C Furthermore we will use the proper Personal Protective Equipment PPE when running experiments References 1
