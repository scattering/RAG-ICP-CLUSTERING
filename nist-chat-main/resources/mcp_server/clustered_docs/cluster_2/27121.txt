 Page 1 of 3 Protein-Zwitterionic Polymer Interactions Dynamics and Structure Amir Erfani Javen Weston Katie Weigandt Josh Ramsey and Clint P Aichele Background and Scientific Importance Advancement of therapeutic protein therapies has been hindered by the poor stability and short half-life of proteins in vivo Protein stability depends on interactions between solvents and proteins interactions between excipients and proteins and proteins interacting with other proteins in a given solution  There is emerging evidence that biocompatible zwitterionic polymersmoieties polymers with equal numbers of opposite charges on each monomer can prevent non-specific interactions within proteins systems 1- For instance recently our work has shown how these interactions can be tuned to prevent protein aggregation  While emerging evidence indicates that the zwitterionized polymers have biocompatibility properties that can have applications in protein stability and protein delivery there is little empirical information available on their mechanism of action More specifically the polyzwitterions dynamics interactions and structure in protein solution and their effect on the protein hydrationsolvation is fairly unknown Currently we are synthesizing three types of zwitterionic polymers alongside with hydrogels prepared from these polymers We have macroscopic experimental evidence that indicates that the hydration of protein molecules has been improved in solutions containing these polymers SANS has been used to evaluate the hydration structure and dynamics of a variety of proteins However to our knowledge the interactions of zwitterionic polymers and proteins in solution have not been studied using this technique SANS offers the unique ability to use contrast matching to isolate scattering in multi-component systems Prior work has indicated that the scattering length densities of the polymers and proteins of interest to us are sufficiently different for contrast matching experiments to be a realistic option No technique beyond SANS allows for this level of contrast matching without altering the solution chemistry Preliminary Work Currently we are studying three types of zwitterionic polymers synthesized in our lab in addition to hydrogels prepared by chemical crosslinking of these polymers These polymers are poly-sulfobetaine PSB  poly-carboxy betaine PCB  and poly-phosphobetaine PMPC  and have been studied for their interaction with biologics We have carried out different bio-physical characterization studies on the effects of these zwitterionic polymers on protein hydration and stability We have carried out 1H NMR and diffusion NMR experiments to characterize these polymers Fig 1 illustrates some of the experimental characterizations and Fig 2 shows preliminary SANS measurements measured at the NIST Center for Neutron Researchs NGB-10m SANS instrument for the protein and polymer studied here Figure 1 Left schematic of the poly-zwitterion Middle SEM of PSB zwitterionic hydrogel crosslinked polymer beads Right hydrogels loaded with fluorescently labelled albumin Experimental Plan Page 2 of 3 The structures and interactions our experiments intend to probe are perfectly within the range of those probed by the SANS instrument 1-100 nm Also contrast matching technique will give us the ability to study the structure and dynamics of the protein and the polymer molecules separately in a mixture We plan to contrast match the protein and the excipients separately This would allow us to explore the structure and dynamics of the polymers in the presence of the biomacromolecules Before studying the protein-polyzwitterion complexes we must measure the scattering length density of the various components The scattering length density is well established in the literature and a single measurement will be made to verify the expected value The SLD for each of the three polyzwitterions must be measured via contrast variation Contrast variation experiments will require approximately three hours per polymer for a total of nine hours After the scattering length densities of the polyzwitterions have been determined we can begin to probe protein-polymer interactions We will use Bovine Serum Albumin BSA a as a model protein for our studies BSA match point is known in the literature The protein concentrations are set 20 mgml to minimize multiple scattering and limit the effect of a structure factor on the measured scattering Well-defined narrowly poly-dispersed polymers will be synthesized in our lab and will be studied at two concentrations between 10 and 50 mgml based on our preliminary results The experiments are summarized in Table II Table II Proteinpolymer interactions experiments Sample Number of tests Notes BSA  PSB buffered 4 2 concentrations x 2 contrasts BSA  PCB buffered 4 2 concentrations x 2 contrasts BSA  PMPC buffered 4 2 concentrations x 2 contrasts BSA  Urea negative control 2 1 concentration x 2 contrasts BSA PEG polyethylene glycol 4 2 concentrations x 2 contrasts A total of 9 samples will be run at the contrast match conditions for the protein and the polyzwitterion for a total of 18 samples We expect each measurement to take 2 hours for a total of 36 hours Factoring in the contrast variation series 9 hours instrument set up and background measurements we request 2 days of 30 m SANS time to complete these experiments Data Analysis and Scientific Outcomes The protein hydration and length of hydration layer amount of bound water will be deduced using the methods described by Bendedouch and Svergun 8  Scattering will also be interpreted using the SasView program to fit the data with models appropriate for proteins and dissolved polymers The results of this study will help the PhD student involved in this project to complete his researchthesis on the interactions of zwitterionic moieties with proteins Results will be published in top peer-reviewed journals such as Langmuir Biomacromolecules and ACS Biomaterials The results of this study will help provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms by which zwitterionic moieties can help increase protein stability prevent non-specific binding and decrease immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins This better understanding can later translate to designing functional protein-polymer complexes for protein delivery and protein formulations that can address deterrents in advancements of biopharmaceuticals Figure 2 Scattering intensity curves for buffered BSA in H2O left and of a buffered PSB solution in D2O right A model fit indicates that the PSB studied here has a radius of gyration of 14 nm and porod exponent of -18 which indicates that PSBMA is very well-solubilized in the buffer
