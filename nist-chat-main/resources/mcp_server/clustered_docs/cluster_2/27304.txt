and Preliminary Data Phytoglycogen is a highly branched natural polysaccharide produced in the form of compact nanoparticles Fig 1 in the kernels of sweet corn The unique properties of phytoglycogen nanoparticles including their softness porosity mechanical integrity biodegradability and nontoxicity make them ideal functional ingredients for applications involving the human body This technology is being commercialized by our industrial partner Mirexus Biotechnologies We have used SANS and QENS to study the structure and hydration properties of aqueous dispersions of phytoglycogen nanoparticles 3 Our most recent SANS data on high purity particles revealed the presence of hairy chains decorating the outer surface of the 22 nm radius particles as described by a core-coil model  Fig 2a Contrast series SANS measurements revealed that the particles contain 250 of their own mass in water 3 and infrared absorption measurements revealed that the hydration water is very highly ordered  Our rheology measurements on concentrated aqueous dispersions of phytoglycogen nanoparticles revealed the soft nature of the particles and allowed us to identify an additional relaxation process that was consistent with a hairy colloid particle geometry  Stimuli-responsive particles that dynamically change their size shape or structure in response to external stimuli such as temperature and pH are attractive materials for a wide variety of applications It is possible to introduce a stimuli-responsive behavior to phytoglycogen nanoparticles by modifying them with octenyl succinic anhydride OSA a food grade modification of starch For OSA-phytoglycogen there are competing effects due to the presence of a negatively charged carboxylic acid group pKa  4 which promotes electrostatic repulsion between particles at neutral pH and a hydrophobic chain which produces an effective attractive interaction between particles in aqueous dispersions The importance of these effects can be tuned by varying the degree of substitution DS and the relative strengths of the two effects can be tuned by adjusting the pH of the solution The effect of OSA modification of phytoglycogen is visually striking At rest concentrated dispersions at neutral pH form gels that do not flow Application of shear eg by shaking the dispersion immediately liquifies the sample when shear is removed the liquid quickly re-gels These reversible dramatic changes in the mechanical properties upon the application and removal of shear indicates weakly attractive interactions due to the hydrophobic modification In Fig 3 we show the zeta potential of aqueous dispersions of native low DS and high DS OSA-phytoglycogen nanoparticles as a function of pH Although the zeta potential of native phytoglycogen is only weakly-dependent on pH there are significant decreases in the magnitude Figure 1 a Molecular dynamics simulation of a phytoglycogen nanoparticle  illustrating their hairy colloid particle geometry b Atomic force microscopy image of phytoglycogen nanoparticles in water at small upper and large lower applied forces  b 2 of the zeta potential of OSA-phytoglycogen as the pH is reduced below the pKa of the acidic group of OSA with a more significant decrease for the larger DS The weakened electrostatic repulsion with pH reduction leads to significant changes in the rheological properties of aqueous dispersions of OSA-phytoglycogen Fig 4 A 20 ww aqueous dispersion of low DS OSA-phytoglycogen at neutral pH forms a viscous shear-sensitive gel that exhibits shear-thinning over the entire range of shear rates red symbols In contrast a 20 ww aqueous dispersion of native phytoglycogen behaves as a low viscosity Newtonian fluid black symbols Upon reducing the pH to 49 the viscosity of the low DS OSA-phytoglycogen sample decreases dramatically becoming comparable to that of native phytoglycogen at all shear rates green symbols This is unexpected since reducing the electrostatic repulsion should increase the attraction between particles producing a larger viscosity Perhaps there is a change in the arrangement of the OSA molecules that could be revealed by SANS After increasing the pH to 7 and dialyzing the sample to remove salts produced by the pH adjustment the low DS OSA-phytoglycogen sample partially recovers to its original rheological state purple symbols We propose to combine rheology with SANS Rheo-SANS to study the structure of concentrated dispersions under different flow and pH conditions Recently we performed SANS measurements of OSA-phytoglycogen with small and large values of DS  A distinctive additional peak was observed in the high-q regime of the SANS curve measured for high DS OSA-phytoglycogen that could be attributed to collapsed OSA-modified chains on the outer surface of the particles resulting in an excellent fit to the raspberry model particle geometry 4 Fig 2b In the low-q regime a structure factor is apparent illustrating particle interactions that are critical to understanding the rheological behavior These data indicate the power of using neutrons to reveal the detailed structure of the particle geometry Aims of the Proposed Experiments and Estimate of Beamtime We will build on the success of our previous SANS experiments as follows We propose to study the effects of decreasing the pH to acidic values and subsequently increasing the pH back to 7 on OSA-phytoglycogen dispersions which should provide insight into the pH-responsive behaviour observed in Figs 3 and 4 As shown in Fig 2b the non-exchangeable hydrocarbons in the OSA tails provide sufficient contrast when dispersed in 100 D2O to characterize the OSA modification of the particles with a distinctive scattering feature at high corresponding to collapsed chains of OSA-modified glucose Simultaneous rheology measurements in the Rheo-SANS environment will provide insight into the effects of OSA modification on particle-particle interactions at high concentrations under shear and allow us to understand the interplay between the electrostatic and hydrophobic aspects of the OSA modification We will measure low and high DS OSA-phytoglycogen in D2O at 20 ww with three samples at each DS value prepared at pH  7 prepared at pH  4 and prepared at pH  4 and then Figure 2 SANS scattering intensity spectra for 1 ww

SANS To accomplish our objectives we request 3 days of access to the NGB 30m SANS instrument equipped with the Anton Paar MCRXX1 rheometer listed as available for the Rheo-SANS environment Previous SANS experiments have shown that the samples scatter strongly Our request of 3 days is based on the following estimates  Baseline structure measurements of 7 samples one 20 ww concentration 2 DS values 3 pH preparations and the unmodified native particl background and controls 12 h  Sweep through shear rates 1 h collections for 7 samples at 8 strain rates in the range 001 to 1000 s-1 to identify structural changes at the onset of shear thinning and the apparent yield stress 60 h Publications and Impact The proposed work will provide unique insight into the structure-flow relationship for shear-sensitive thixotropic concentrated dispersions of OSA-phytoglycogen We will obtain new fundamental knowledge of the delicate balance between electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic attraction in this tunable soft colloid system which we expect will lead to publication in a high impact journal In addition this work will help to identify new applications for OSA-phytoglycogen
