Understanding processes in freeze-drying of biologic materials USANS BT-5 NIST 1 Background and Context The freeze-drying process was extensively developed as a commercial technique to render blood plasma and penicillin to be stable under long transportation during World War II although the basic principles of freeze-drying were known previously This process has since become a multi-purpose tool for both pharmaceuticals and food processing Our goal is to understand and to optimise the process of drying and rehydrating probiotic bacteria that is non-destructive to the material and that creates a uniform dry cake with very long shelf-life This work is a collaboration between scientists at BioGaia Uppsala University and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden The project is part of a scheme that is intended to bring new users to neutron facilities and to support work of industrial and practical relevance Although a study will be performed on samples with which we have particular familiarity the results are likely to be of widespread interest in academia as well as in industry This work forms part of an ongoing study of viability 1 2 Proposed experiment In-depth understanding of material structure properties and degradation during actual use is crucial for manufacturers and an understanding of such details is essential in order to optimize the freeze-drying process We aim in this initial study to identify the amount and possibly main location of residual water during the final stages of the freeze-drying process first stages of rehydration and during ageing of the dry material We also want to look at the spatial distribution of the material in the maximally freeze-concentrated matrix and how this can be altered for example by the nature of the lyoprotectants used that is substances such as simple sugars that are added to the formulation in order to protect the bacteria from the harsh freeze-drying conditions and over time when drying and ageing Neutrons have the advantage that we can exploit isotope labelling easily with eg heavy waterlight water exchange to identify where specific components occur in our samples Specifically we intend to study the freeze-drying processes at different stages of de- and re-hydration of probiotic lactobacilli using USANS This would give an insight into the process that is simply not possible using other techniques Our goal is an optimized product through increased understanding of the process It is apparent that previous studies of freeze-drying using neutrons have primarily exploited spectroscopy to look at for example changes in glass transition with various additives  although there have been some studies of interfaces  There have also been some investigations of specific interactions of lyoprotectants with eg lipids  The presence and main location of water is central in this project Structural changes can be probed and enable studies of clustering or aggregation fractures or shape change of bacterial products The present study will investigate bulk behaviour at relatively large length scales by exploiting USANS to investigate the changes as water content is reduced followed by a rehydration The planned measurements will exploit standard sample vials although one can envisage using a custom-built freeze-drying apparatus that can be used with boron-free glass vials commonly used in conventional laboratory tests to study the process in-situ This initial USANS study will seek to clarify a changes in size and shape on freezing and on drying b distribution of lyoprotectant by looking at deuterated lyoprotectant with everything else hydrogenous and c changes on rehydration This could be done with a couple of concentrations of lyoprotectant 3 Summary of previous characterisation The material has been characterised using other techniques for example scanning electron microscopy Figure 1 contact angle often low surface potential about -10 mV and size determination using light scattering methods Figure 1 indicate rods 12 m to 15 m depending on growth conditions BioGaia develops produces and markets products based on probiotic lactobacilli of the species Lactobacillus reuteri Gram-positive bacteria a b Figure 1 a Scanning electron micrograph and b size distribution 4 Justification of beamtime request A controlled drying experiment will be investigated in such a way as to put samples from different stages of dryingrehydration and selected samples after time in sample vials in the beam By doing experiments with isotopic contrasts different regionscomponents of the sample can be highlighted It is of high interest to clarify if the water within the cells are lost Preparation of samples will be done in both H2O and D2O and with deuterated and non-deuterated lyoprotectants in this experiment we will use sucrose sld 110-6 -2 and 4810-6 -2 In order to obtain good information about the sample USANS data in the momentum transfer range 2  10-5 to 2  10-3 -1 will be measured This should enable us to determine the shape of bacteria and how that is affected by the change in water content of its surroundings The overall measurements will be for bacteria in both heavy and light water one sample with hydrogenous and one sample with deuterated lyoprotectant wet frozen and during drying and then wet again This would allow one to see where the lyoprotectant is but the measuring time for this may depend on the amount of lyoprotectant Along with appropriate background measurements this is expected to amount to up to 20 samples and take 25 days on BT-5 References 1 Garcia Armando  Herrmann Anke  Hkansson Sebastian 2017 Isothermal microcalorimetry for rapid viability assessment of freeze-dried Lactobacillus reuteri
