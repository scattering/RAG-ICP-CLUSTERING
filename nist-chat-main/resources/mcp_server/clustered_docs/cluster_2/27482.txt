1 Impact of amphiphile on shear banding in self-assembled polymers Scientific significance Shear banding is common in complex fluids including wormlike micelles WLMs12 This instability occurs when the flow becomes inhomogeneous and separates into bands of distinct viscosity and structure marked by discontinuities in the velocity profile across the rheometer gap Fig 1 Despite reported shear banding in polymer WLMs pWLMs current research has focused on surfactant WLMs sWLMs or linear polymers Shear banding in linear polymers is typically transient unstable or an artifact of slip fracture or geometry3 conversely sWLMs dynamically rearrange and break enabling steady state shear banding2 As breakage in pWLMs is limited due to unfavorable solvent-polymer interactions4 the shear banding characteristics likely fall between these limiting cases though this behavior5-7 and the microstructural basis remain largely unexplored Most reported pWLM solutions are formed from amphiphilic triblock poloxamers a class of commercial polyethylene oxide-block-polypropylene oxide-block-polyethylene oxide PEO-PPO- PEO polymers Wormlike structures grow at elevated temperatures in the presence of salt or alcohols that dehydrate the micelle core and corona56 In the limited work on pWLM shear banding wall-slip and elastic instabilities have been reported5-7 however a mechanistic understanding of shear banding and the role of amphiphile size and limited breakage is lacking Understanding pWLM shear banding thus has the potential to bridge the knowledge gap between the two limiting cases of breakage and reformation-dominated sWLM shear banding and polymer shear banding which may only be observed with significant edge effects Methodology We will systematically evaluate pWLM shear banding using flow-small angle neutron scattering SANS in a series of poloxamers Flow-gradient 1-2 plane SANS flow-SANS with spatial resolution can confirm shear banding at conditions identified by nonlinear rheology measurements as previously done for sWLMs8910 Discontinuities in the orientation parameter Af and the orientation angle along the flow gap indicate shear banding8911 Using flow-SANS with temporal resolution the structural mechanisms leading to shear band formation will then be identified from shear startup11 Flow-SANS will be complemented with particle tracking velocimetry PTV which is currently being developed in the Calabrese lab Poloxamer characteristics solution conditions and micelle features already measured via linear rheology and static SANS will be paired with flow-SANS results to identify important parameters relevant to shear banding Preliminary results suggest that amphiphile molecular weight pWLM cross-sectional area and the relative core vs shell dimensions are important factors in determining shear banding further motivating flow-SANS measurements System Poloxamers identified as forming pWLMs in the presence of salt5-71213 have been selected for larger study L64 P84 P104 P105 P123 where the role of molecular weight Mn PEO weight fraction xPEO and PPO molecular weight MnPPO on pWLM formation and shear banding can be systematically examined Here we focus on 4 L64 P84 and P104 in 2M D2O brine which have the same xPEO but different Mn These three poloxamers have been previously shown to form entangled pWLMs671213 we confirmed pWLM formation in the presence of salt with increasing temperature via static SANS for each shown in Fig 1 for P104 While poloxamers with equal PEO fraction should have similar packing parameters poloxamer size limits the achievable pWLM cross-sectional area1314 among other features Our static SANS results suggest that the role of PEO weight fraction may be more important in smaller amphiphiles like L64 which have fewer possible configurations once dehydrated than higher molecular weight analogues and that different poloxamers can assemble into pWLMs of similar cross-sectional area 2 and length but may have different aggregation numbers or chain densities in the micelle shell Preliminary results The pWLM-forming phase space has been mapped for the three poloxamers with added salt as a function of temperature Fig 1 for P104 using static SANS and linear oscillatory rheology where thermally- induced micellar growth manifests as a large increase in the dynamic moduli Fig 1 2a6 Temperature ramps were used to elucidate a transition temperature Ttrans where the dynamic moduli cross Static SANS intensities were fit in the high-q region using the core-shell cylinder form factor to determine the cross-sectional micelle parameters and degree of solvent penetration in the core and shell using known values of the scattering length densities SLDs Initially both 4 and 15 aqueous solutions were investigated using linear rheology to determine the micellar growth region Fig 2a and nonlinear rheology to determine potential shear banding regions Fig 2b Temperature sweeps measuring the dynamic moduli show transitions indicative of micellar growth that are similar for all three poloxamers Fig 2a as expected at elevated temperatures67 Normalized temperature sweeps superimpose for P84 and P104 at both concentrations suggesting similar microstructures and solution properties Interestingly L64 exhibits growth in G before Ttrans and has lower post-transition moduli than the other formulations suggesting shorter andor less entangled pWLMs As shear banding was previously identified in 4 P84 within a specific temperature window the T -Ttrans comparison allowed similar conditions to be identified at higher concentrations and for the other poloxamers Signatures of shear banding in WLMs include a near-zero slope in the flow curve stress vs shear rate Fig 2b flow sweep hysteresis long transients and oscillating stress responses among others167 Flow sweeps Fig 2b at equivalent normalized temperatures T -Ttrans suggest shear banding in P84 and P104 N006 consistent with previous results in 4 P84568 Though P104 Fig 1 Rheology signatures of micellar growth are confirmed via SANS shown for 4 P104 in 2M D2O brine Fig 2 Normalized poloxamer rheology for xPEO04 a Temperature ramps superimpose for P84 and P104 regardless of concentration shear banding is likely based on the flow curves b L64 is nearly Newtonian and exhibits distinct transition behavior and a lower post-transition modulus 3 shear banding has not been reported previously near-zero slopes in the flow curves and long transients 1 h and oscillations in startup measurements indicate shear banding Despite the Maxwellian relaxation spectrum in 15 L64 indicating entangled pWLMs only mild shear thinning is seen Fig 2b SANS data fitting reveals that the total micelle radius in L64 is substantially smaller 60 than P84 and P104 at both 4 and 15 P104 and P84 have similar core and shell radii Rc Ts at both concentrations where Rc16Ts In L64 the core and shell are closer in size where Rc12Ts These results suggest that both micelle radius and relative core vs shell dimension may play an important role in determining shear banding Proposed experiments We propose steady shear startup measurements using the 1-2 shear cell on 4 P84 and 4 P104 to detect the transient structural phenomena leading to pWLM shear banding As a control startup measurements at two shear rates will be performed on the non-banding 4 L64 Startup rheology indicates that on average steady state is reached after 2h due to the long-time dynamic rearrangement in pWLMs minimal breakage After each measurement samples will be rejuvenated by a thermal cycling protocol to erase residual structure verified by our preliminary experiments Here a valve-controlled two-circulator system at the NCNR will be used where one circulator is held at temperature and the other is held at 10  C This setup allows thermal cycling to be done in less than 30 minutes for a total time of 25h per startup measurement For both samples three shear rates within and one outside of the shear banding region at equivalent Weissenberg numbers will be probed Due to slow dynamics measuring the complete evolution of the banded state at several gap positions would take prohibitively long Instead using a narrow 01 mm translating slit the 1-2 shear cell gap will be scanned repeatedly at seven positions to obtain precise spatial resolution at various time points as the flow evolves toward steady state This spatio-temporal information will help to identify the number of shear bands and to elucidate the mechanism of shear band formation The acquisition time will be determined based on count rate using many guides our previous experiments indicate 2-4 minposition is needed giving 4-8 gap scans during the startup test Two additional replicates at each shear rate will be performed to determine reproducibility with respect to velocity and structure oscillations and to focus on gap positions that yield the most mechanistic information ie near the walls or near the band interface At the most promising Wi for both samples startup measurements at one gap position in each band 03 mm slit will be performed to directly track the microstructural evolution 1 replicate Time-dependent scattering files will be processed with our in-house algorithms that greatly improve the SANS temporal resolution by allowing for overlapping temporal bins15 creating a continuous signal The time-dependent alignment paired with the startup rheology can then be used to determine a structural mechanism as previously done915 From preliminary experiments one configuration covering 002  q  015 -1 is sufficient for these measurements Based on 25 hours per measurement for P104 and P84 3 shear banding rates  1 non-banding 3x each and 2 single position runs and L64 2 shear rates 3x each we request 4 days of SANS on the 1-2 shear cell including set-up and alignment References  Olmsted P D Rheol Acta 2008 473 283-300
