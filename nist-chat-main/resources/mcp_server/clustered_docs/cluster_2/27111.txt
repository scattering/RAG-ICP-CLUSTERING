 E-Chocolate In recent years neutron science is effectively being used in new material research in a less expected area such as the food industry SANSUSANS capabilities give researchers the ability to study the dynamics of food particles since their particle size is suitable to the wavelengths used in USANS the shape and size of these particles can be studied The results of these studies benefit industrial production not only economically but also for the production of healthier and tastier foods Thus the impact of this kind of research is two -fold as the new material research which is a gain for physical sciences and as for the health sciences which is a gain for the general public Here we are applying to study the shape and size of chocolate particles Our study will focus on structural changes of the chocolate particles as they are subjected to an applied electric field In the pioneering study of this subject the electric filed E field is applied in the flow direction of the chocolate  The flow is maintained by gravity and the applied external gas pressure The observed change in the flow rate of the chocolate when an E field is applied is compared to the values when there is not any which is related to a viscosity decrease in the molten chocolate liquid A change in the maximally random jammed MRJ sphere packing of chocolate is claimed to be in effect as such an E field application produces elongated spheroids of chocolate particles which in turn decreases the viscosity of the liquid chocolate In this first study a capillary tube is used to calculate the change in the viscosity before and after the E field application We repeated these measurements using a uniquely designed homemade experimental setup and observed more or less the same amount of flow rate increase under the applied E field case Even though we managed to increase the flow rate under several different E field strengths we still do not know the real effect of E field on the shape and the size of the chocolate particles -macro-molecules of chocolate mixture- The chocolate used was in fact a mixture of several ingredients including cocoa liquor cocoa butter milk powder sugar and lecithin along with several chocolate emulsifiers forming spherical particles in the order of tens of m in size This size of spherical colloidal suspension of chocolate particles were measured to be  20 30 m in diameter using scanning probe and confocal laser scanning microscopy techniques 23 However this size is measured to be  2m in the E field study analysis  This corresponds to almost one order discrepancy in the particle size and therefore the change in the shape of these particles become an open question In other words the real effect of the E field in the structure of chocolate is a subject to be investigated in more detail way Here we apply for a SANS measurement in order to increase our knowledge about this delicious food chocolate We plan to investigate the chocolate particles in situ of the E field using the setup given in the sketched Fig1 We are eager to see and to map out the size and shape of chocolate particles as a function of E field Neutron scattering from the chocolate will give a contrast change and we would correlate this information to measure the size and the shape of the particles We do not think that we need to deuterated the samples This would hopefully shed more light on the size argument of chocolate particles and the effect of E field We also plan to study time and temperature effects on the structure of chocolate We believe the elongated particle shape will stay elongated for a certain amount of time depending on the strength of the field temperature and size of the particle The E field processed chocolate samples would be put into sample holders which would be held at a constant temperature for a certain amount of time After this the samples would be put into the beam and the USANS data would be collected This way we aim to study the dynamics and memory effects of the chocolate particles and how and how long they stay as aligned and elongated The crystallization temperature of chocolate can be given by  36 C which is actually the cocoa butter polymorph triclinic crystallization temperature  We plan to use different temperatures from this value up to 45 C during these experiments To complete this proposed study we are requesting for 2 days of beam time The interested q range is expected in the 0003 to 02 -1 which can be traced by USANS beamline  R Tao H Tang K Tawhid-Al-Islam E Du J Kim PNAS Vol 113 No 27 P
