Analysis of the Magnetic and Colloidal Structure of Magnetic Nanoflowers The use of functionalized magnetic nanostructures in biology and medicine has increased dramatically during the past two decades Many applications such as imaging cell sorting therapeutic heating hyperthermia or drug delivery exploit the unique physical and magnetic properties inherent in magnetic materials that possess characteristic dimensions smaller than 150 nm Here we focus on hyperthermia  and magnetic particle imaging MPI  Hyperthermia works by applying an alternating magnetic field AMF to magnetic nanoparticles inside a tumor This AMF raises the local tumor temperature to 42 C - 45 C causing necrosis in the tumor without overheating and damaging the surrounding normal tissues While a simple concept its widespread clinical application has yet to be realized despite the knowledge of its biological effectiveness because a simple prescription formula for doctors does not yet exist due to the complexity of optimizing the nanoparticles for high heat output at low applied magnetic fields while maintaining colloidal stability in the blood low toxicity high targeting specificity to the tumors and uniform distribution within a tumor MPI in contrast uses a lower frequency AMF to access the non-linear response of the magnetization to an applied magnetic field thereby generating the image signal MPI shows tremendous promise as an imaging modality but development of effective contrast agents has lagged behind the development of the instrumentation The nanoparticles we will use were developed by Micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH The system has been characterized thermally and demonstrates the highest heat production at the lowest fields for any system that we have studied We are currently working on the physical and magnetic characterization including magnetometry transmission electron microscopy TEM Mossbauer spectroscopy dynamic light scattering and x-ray diffraction To get a complete understanding of the origin of their enhanced heating behavior we want to use polarization analyzed SANS to focus exclusively on the magnetic structure of the magnetic nanoflowers both internal to a nanoparticle and as an interacting colloid and how it changes as a function of applied magnetic field We will work with one representative core an approx 50 nm iron oxide nanoflower so called because it resembles a flower in TEM images - see the schematic in Figure 1 but with two distinct coatings starch or dextran to control the interactions between nanoflowers From our magnetic field work on related systems  we know that the magnetic structure contributes to the scattering in both the pure H2O and pure D2O samples Figure 2 In H2O samples the structural scattering from the iron oxide is dominant and it is difficult to separate out the magnetic structure D2O is contrast matched to the iron oxide structural scattering length and previous D2O data can be fit using a model in which several magnetic domains reside within each nanoparticle The model is not unique however because dextran scattering is still evident We are therefore requesting polarized beam SANS time to examine solely the magnetic structure as a function of applied magnetic field as the colloidal structure has been demonstrated  to have a profound impact on the magnetic properties To perform complete polarization analysis we will use a FeSi supermirror array to polarize the incident neutrons a polarized 3He cell in transmission geometry as a spin analyzer and a standard spin flipper and an in situ NMR flipper for the incident and scattered neutrons respectively We will measure all four polarization spin scattering cross-sections ie up-up down-down up-down down-up and correct for polarization efficiencies using an algorithm which also explicitly accounts for the time dependence of the analyzer  Using this approach we will be able to extract all three vector components of the magnetization and thus isolate the inter- and intra-particle magnetic structure We are requesting seven days of beamtime for unpolarized and polarized beam SANS to fully characterize the field evolution of the intra- and inter-particle magnetic structure From our previous experience the unpolarized measurements provide essential details regarding the interparticle correlations and their sensitivity to applied field Polarization analysis PASANS is essential for the separation of the magnetism and structure within each nanoparticle We will work on two samples Nanoflower core with a dextran layer and nanoflower core with a starch layer in 100 H2O and 100 D2O at the same concentration of 25 mgml The change in coating will significantly influence the magnetic interactions and therefore both the colloidal structure as well as the internal magnetic domain structure Both contrast matches are requested as we need to isolate the magnetic scattering contributions for all components In addition we are requesting six 6 fields for each sample zero field 100 Oe 250 Oe 500 Oe 750 Oe and 15000 Oe This will allow us to study the change in the internal magnetic structure as well as the colloidal structure at the applied magnetic fields with large changes in magnetic behavior The results from this experiment should provide quantitative details about the nature of the magnetic and colloidal structure and will eliminate any artifacts in our model originating from incomplete contrast of either the dextran or nuclear scattering Approximately a half day will be involved in the polarized beam set-up and installation of the magnet Full characterization of both samples will be performed at room temperature with an unpolarized beam at all six fields The normal time to complete a full Q range for our samples with unpolarized beam is 3 hours on VSANS for a total of 3 days Based upon these results we will perform full PASANS at three select fields of interest on both samples There are four neutron spin cross sections so each condition will take at least 12 hours and there are 6 conditions 2 samples x 3 magnetic fields We then have to measure an empty cell in the non-spin flip and spin flip configurations Again using the same times as before this will require 12 hours resulting 35 additional days for polarized beam analysis Our total beamtime request is seven days  CL Dennis and R Ivkov International Journal of Hyperthermia 29 2013 715  B Gleich and J Weizenecker Nature 435 2005 1214  CL Dennis et al Advanced Functional Materials 25 2015 4300  CL Dennis et al Nanotechnology 29 2018 215705  KL Krycka et al Journal of Applied Physics 109 2011 07B513  M Wetegrove et al Crystal Engineering Communications 21 2019 1956 Figure 1 -
