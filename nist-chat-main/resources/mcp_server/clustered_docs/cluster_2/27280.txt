Significance Understanding the complex rheology of high solid suspensions has technological relevance for numerous industrial products such as coatings cement and abrasives  These suspensions are often processed at high shear rate or shear stress in high solid content where shear thickening occurs The enhancement of viscosity can arise from lubrication friction  or direct contact friction  In both cases lubrication hydrodynamics drives the formation of hydroclusters  which have been measured experimentally using Rheo-USANS  and Rheo and Flow-SANS  While it is not possible to simply distinguish the mechanism that gives rise to the strong increase in viscosity from the bulk viscosity measurements important microstructural differences exist between these two mechanisms Flow-SANS measurements in 1-2planesof flow by Gurnon and Wagner  indicate particles for which lubrication friction dominates have a flow-induced anisotropy Fig 1athat is quantitatively consistent with Stokesian Dynamics simulations Fig 1b  Meanwhile simulations of suspensions for which strong contact friction dominates the rheology  show a distinctly different anisotropy in the nearest neighbor distribution Fig 1c which has not been measured experimentally Importantly the rheological property of the first normal stress difference is particularly sensitive to this nearest neighbor anisotropy and changes sign between mechanisms 8 The purpose of this research is to measure the structure in flowing suspensions with varying levels of contact friction for the first time We demonstrated rheological properties for model suspensions that are consistent with predictions of simulations that include contact friction 1 Furthermore by controlling the colloidal particle composition and surface coating the rheology could be tuned between these two behaviors A key parameter is the strength of the van der Waals interactions between particles where attraction between particles can induce frictional contact Thus we propose to test the hypothesis that contact friction is controlling shear thickening in concentrated suspensions by measuring the change in microstructure under flow using Rheo-USANS and 1-2 plane Flow-SANS Our model colloidal suspension consists of a TiO2 core with a variable silica coating in an index matching suspending medium PEG which is an optical match for the SiO2 that provides a method to tune the van der Waals attraction This can be directly compared against Flow-SANS and Rheo-USANS measurements on pure SiO2 colloidal suspensions with similar surface coatings As shown in Fig 2a an estimate of the van der Waals potential calculation via Lifshitz theory reveals that the Hamaker constant of pure TiO2 is approximately 50 times larger than that of a pair of pure SiO2 By tuning the RheoFlow-SANS and Rheo-USANS of Suspensions with Controllable Contact Friction thickness of SiO2 layer for example with 10 nm coating thickness the attraction of titania core will drop to a comparable scale as that of pure silica and transition from contact friction to hydrodynamic friction can be expected 1 Rheo-USANS and 1-2 plane Flow-SANS can provide a unique opportunity to observe the microstructure for testing the current theories and simulations prevalent in the literature Rheo-USANS allows high resolution characterization of the mesoscale multi-particle level to monitor structure progression hydrocluster growth under shear in these systems  1-2 plane Flow-SANS provides critical information about the microstructure in the plane of shear for critically testing whether friction is important The resulting observations will help resolve the boundary between contact and hydrodynamic friction for mechanism of shear thickening Figure 1 a Structure in the 1-2

Preliminary work Flow curves of SiO2-coated TiO2 ScT and bare silica suspensions are shown in Fig 2b and 2c where ScT suspension shows positive first normal stress around shear thickened state

thickness Systems The system consists of concentrated suspensions of SiO2 d  350 nm and ScT nanoparticles d  200-300 nm dispersed in PEG200 Different thicknesses of silica coating will be applied by re-growing silica layer on ScT particles via Stober process to tune the van der Waals interaction The bare RheoFlow-SANS and Rheo-USANS of Suspensions with Controllable Contact Friction silica and ScT particles used in this study will take up 45-55 vol to ensure shear-thickening Proposed experiment The objective of this proposal is to measure the microstructure and shear thickening rheology for three systems bare silica spheres and ScT particles with thin and thick silica coating Among these particles the surface properties are presumably the same but titania core imparts strong short range attraction which facilitates frictional contact as particles are close to proximity under shear Thin SiO2-coated titania performs strongest shear thickening behavior where frictional contact dominates rheology With thicker silica coating on titania reduced shear thickening will be expected due to weaker van der Waals attraction where particles still remain lubricated 1-2 plane Flow-SANS measurement enables us to examine the difference of microstructure at shear thickened state from frictional contact system to lubricated system by tuning the short range attraction Rheo-USANS will prove the existence of hydroclusters and their extent for comparison to simulations and models Microstructure evolution from low to high shear rate as well as at rest will be measured to see how structure grows in three systems This will enable critically testing simulations and models for examining how different levels of contact affect suspensions rheology The USANS experiment will be performed using the Anton Paar Rheometer with the Couette geometry Prior experience suggests 6 hours per experiment The anticipated run time will be approximately 6 days to enable seven shear rates and three samples A complementary 1-2 plane Flow-SANS and Rheo-SANS proposal is submitted aiming to characterize the 2D anisotropic structure under high solids and shear to overlap with the Rheo-USANS but expose anisotropy in the 1-2 and 1-3 plane This work is an important component of the doctoral research of Yu-Fan Lee and these experiments cannot be performed with x-ray or light scattering References  J
