Rheol 42 1095 1998 Experimental validation of closure approximations for constitutive models of rod-like suspensions with rheo-SANS Patrick T Corona Zvonimir Dogic L Gary Leal and Matthew E Helgeson UC Santa Barbara M Pavlik Lettinga Forschungszentrum Jlich and KU Leuven Motivation A grand challenge in the field of complex fluids is the formulation of constitutive models that describe the relationship between flow and stress beyond the simple linear relationship afforded by Newtonian approximations In the case of suspensions of non-spherical particles the constitutive models that have been developed rely on determining moments of the orientation distribution function OPDF ie the probability that a particle is aligned in a certain direction under flowing conditions Typically such constitutive models are derived using an empirically specified closure approximation relating the second moment and fourth moment tensors and the choice of a valid closure approximation remains an open question Recently we have developed a novel method for extracting moments of the OPDF from SANS measurements of rod-like suspensions which can now be used to test the accuracy of closure approximations experimentally regardless of the details of the underlying physical model and provide a stronger foundation for the development of new models We propose rheo-SANS experiments to measure the nonequilibrium OPDF of a model rod-like particle suspension under simple shear flow and experimentally validate closure approximations for use in constitutive modeling of complex fluids Background Complex fluids represent a class of materials whose microstructure can be modified through an imposed external flow field This change in microstructure configuration can in turn change the bulk stress in the flowing system leading to modifications to the overall flow field As a starting point for exploring this complex coupling between microstructure deformation and flow non-spherical particle suspensions represent an attractive system to study due to dominating contribution from single degree of freedom the orientation of the particles and the wide range of applications where this class of fluids is found The classical theory for non-spherical particle suspensions in flow has been developed for the case of dilute non-interacting particles but solving this theory requires determining the full OPDF while the expression for the fluid stress only requires knowledge of the moments of the OPDF 1 In principle one may reformulate the dynamical equations to solve for the moments of the OPDF and therefore the stress but these equations always depend on higher order moments of the OPDF A similar problem is encountered when the theory is extended to include other physical phenomena including excluded volume interactions mean-field external potentials or flow-induced breakagereformation 3- A common approach to solve this problem is to specify a closure approximation between the second and fourth moments of the OPDF Such a closure approximation greatly simplifies the calculation of stress enabling the use of these theories for flow simulation in complex geometries but the problem of when or if a certain closure approximation is valid for describing non-idealized fluids remains an open question Recently we have developed a new method for extracting the full OPDF of a model rod-like system of fd-virus particles from flow-SANS measurements in simple shear flow In brief the method utilizes Bayesian estimation and knowledge of the anisotropic particle form factor to determine the most likely OPDF that reproduces the measured scattering pattern 6 The method makes no assumptions about the form of the OPDF and such knowledge enables an unbiased measurement of moments under arbitrary conditions with small-angle scattering This proposal seeks to utilize this novel method and flow-SANS measurements to experimentally test moment closure approximations for a wide range of shear rates and particle concentrations  S Dutta and M D Graham J Non-Newton Fluid Mech 251 97 2018  K S Silmore X Gong M S Strano and J W Swan ACS Nano 13 3940 2019  G Alina P D Butler J Cho M Doucet and P Kienzle 2017  C Lang J Kohlbrecher L Porcar and M P Lettinga Polymers 8 1 2016 Preliminary data Our proposal focuses on dispersions of fd-virus which are model rod-like particle dispersions The fd-virus is a monodisperse particle with high aspect ratio R  33 nm L  920 nm and the particles are dispersed in a buffer solution that screens charge interactions The concentrations of particles we consider range from the overlap concentration where direct particle interactions begin to contribute to the particle dynamics to the isotropic-nematic transition where interparticle interactions dominate the dynamics of the particles This range of concentrations is the most relevant for applications We are interested in probing the structure of these dispersions in simple shear flow because it represents a special type of flow where the OPDF becomes biaxial and thus represents the most rigorous test of closure approximations Furthermore advances in SANS sample environments enable one to probe the material response in rheometric flows from different detector planes relative to the flow field As will be demonstrated this consideration proves crucial for the proposed study To date we have made flow-SANS measurements in the flow flow-gradient plane 1-2 and the flow vorticity plane 1-3 for concentrated dispersions near the isotropic-nematic transition  Figure 1 includes the components of the fourth moment tensor extracted using the previously described method and utilizing different data sets only measurements from the 1-3 plane only measurements from the 1-2 plane and measurements from both planes While for brevity we do not include the supporting information here but we note that the result utilizing measurements from both the 1-2 and 1-3 detector planes provides an accurate result Crucially resolving all the components of the fourth moment tensor requires simultaneous measurement of the structure in two orthogonal detector planes For example the moments in the right column 1112 1222 and 1233 predict a value of zero from only utilizing the 1-3 measurement while utilizing the 1-2 measurement reveals that this component has a value Alternatively utilizing only the 1-2 measurement leads to an under-prediction of the 1111 component By utilizing measured scattering in two detector planes one may experimentally measure the OPDF and subsequently the moments of the OPDF In this way we will test moment closure approximations through direct comparison of the measured moments A critical question that was not answered in this previous study is whether the measured moments are in agreement with theoretical predictions Unfortunately strategies for numerically calculating the fourth moments are limited to the dilute limit where interparticle interactions can be neglected whereas previous measurements were made at higher concentrations Therefore measurements of a dilute fd-virus dispersion where we know what the OPDF should be are crucial for quantitatively validating the OPDF extraction procedure so that it can be used with confidence This will enable the methods utilization for non-dilute and more complex systems Figure 1 The unique non-zero fourth moments of the OPDF for a concentrated dispersion of fd-virus as a function of shear rate The shape of the point corresponds to the information included in the fitting method either measurements with only 1-3 rheo-SANS only 1-2 shear cell or both 1-2  1-3 measurements  E Barry D Beller and Z Dogic Soft Matter 5 2563 2009 1 Y C Kim A Bnard and C A Petty Ind Eng Chem Res 54 4497 2015 where no theoretical prediction of the OPDF exists At the same time the comparison with dilute theory will provide validation of the fd-virus dispersion as a model system for testing moment closure approximations in such non-dilute situations Detailed experimental plan Y21M fd-virus the monodisperse rod-like particle will be dispersed at a concentration of 191 mgmL in D2O with a 100 mM tris buffer to screen electrostatic interactions  This concentration lies below the overlap concentration of particles where direct interactions are assumed to be negligible SANS measurements will then be made on VSANS using the rheo-SANS and 1-2 shear cell sample environments Measurements in these two sample environments allow us to probe the small-angle scattering in the 1-3 and 1-2 planes respectively ensuring that we can resolve all components of the fourth moment and second moment tensors Previous measurements found that a q-range from 001 to 02 -1 was necessary to extract the OPDF which is the range we plan to use We will measure the equilibrium structure and the steady-state structure at 10 shear rates ranging from 1 to 512 s-1 in a logarithmic increment for each sample environment which enables us to completely span the range of flow strength from weak microstructural alignment to a nearly completely aligned microstructure  Use of the VSANS instrument will be beneficial for this study given the option for white beam and the two at least detector banks will minimize the count time required for these dilute particle dispersions These measurements could also be run using any of the 30m SANS instruments at NCNR but the number of shear rates tested would have to be reduced Based upon initial equilibrium measurements of the fd-virus dispersions and calculations accounting for the changing beam size between sample environments we anticipate that measurements in the rheo-SANS sample environment will take approximately 1 hour per condition while measurements in the 1-2 shear cell will take approximately 3 hour per condition with the VSANS instrument This ensures that we can achieve sufficient statistics for utilizing the OPDF extraction method Our request also includes time for instrumentsample environment calibration background measurement and absolute intensity measurement In total we request 3 days of beam time on the VSANS instrument one day with the rheo-SANS sample environment and two days with the 1-2 shear cell sample environment Analysis and impact The methodology used to extract the OPDF and moments will be applied to the measured small-angle scattering From this methodology we will extract the same moment information as included in Figure 1 for the concentrated dispersion From the fourth moments the second moments can be calculated using the relation 555W5X   55555W5X5V5V5V because  555V5V5V  1 We will then compare these moments to numerical predictions from dilute rod theory to assess the applicability of this fd-virus system as a model rod-like particle dispersion With the fourth and second moments calculated and the fd-virus dispersion validated as a model system we will test equalities given by various closure approximations The closure approximations that are of particular interest to test are reviewed in Kim et al and range from the classical HL composite closures to modern fully symmetric quadratic FSQ mapping closures 1 Beyond the dilute concentrations that we will measure in these proposed experiments we will expand the test of closure approximations to the concentrated regime using previously-made SANS measurements The result will be a complete experimental assessment of the validity of moment closure approximations for a wide range of concentrations and shear rates The study proposed here will have implications beyond constitutive modeling and the data sets collected can be used to test prescribed forms of the OPDF to expedite SANS fitting of orientable particle dispersions under non-equilibrium conditions
