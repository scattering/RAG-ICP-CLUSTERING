The adsorption of starch particles to interfaces BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION Oil in water OW emulsions can be stabilized by adsorbing particles at the oilwater interfaces ie the so-called Pickering type emulsions1 Starch particles have been used to stabilize OW food emulsions2 This is because starch is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is safe to use in foods and because it is abundant biodegradable and inexpensive Native non-modified starch however has limitations in its applications due to its hydrophilic surface properties which makes it less suitable as a stabilizer Starch particles modified by esterification with dicarboxylic acids to give octenyl succinic anhydride OSA starch is an approved food additive that can be used to stabilize oil in water emulsions used in foods and drinks3 However the effects of the OSA modification of the starch particle on the interfacial interactions are not fully understood In a previous study we have directly measured the packing of films of OSA modified rice starch granules at airaqueous interfaces and the interaction forces in that system as a function of the particle hydrophobicity and ionic strength4 This was achieved by using a combined Langmuir trough and optical microscope system and the Monolayer Interaction Particle Apparatus Increasing the degree of OSA modification improved the particle packing within the film of particles at the airwater interface due to the introduction of inter-particle electrostatic interactions within the film typical results are shown in figure 1 In the proposed stu Figure 1 Example approach force curves between a starch particle probe in the water phase and a bare airwater interface or a starch film at an airwater interface where the same particle type used to prepare the films

attraction to repulsion more clearly Figure 2 The simulated reflectometry curve when starch particles form a 6 m thick film on hydrophobized silicon and a 50  thick bilayer of 12 -dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane DOTAP with an SLD of 2x10-6 -2 The SLD of starch partcles was assumed to be 2x10-6 -2 and the coverage 50 for both substrates Under these conditions we can separate between silicon substrate the starch layer on silicon and starch on DOTAP bilayer The aim with the present study is to reveal and quantify starch particle adsorption with different hydrophobicity and charge at the solid-liquid interface For this purpose we will use a hydrophobic 0204002040-400 -200 0 200 400020400 100 200 300-505100 100 200 300-505100 100 200 300-50510Force nNA

allow for a higher particle density on the surface EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Sample preparation The rice starch particles will be modified with octenyl succinic anhydride OSA as described earlier3 This is expected to give surface hydrophobized starches with a modification level of 046001 and 236002 OSA by mass in relation to starch dry matter These values correspond to degrees of substitution DS of 00036 and 00186 respectively In this study we refer to these particles as 06RS and 30RS respectively Native rice starch particles NRS will be used as reference The diameter of the native rice particles was determined in earlier studies to be 692017 m3 The zeta potential for NRS 06RS and 30RS was -19812 -27810 and -35118 mV respectively4 The hydrophobized silicon blocks will be prepared by placing plasma cleaned blocks in a desiccator under vacuum with 1 ml of dimethyloctylchlorosilane DMOCS overnight After that hydrophobized the blocks will be sonicated for 20 min first in tetrahydrofuran and then in ethanol The DOTAP bilayers on supporting silica will be prepared by vesicle fusion with clean bare silicon blocks from a 5 mg lipidml dispersion in 150 mM NaCl followed by rinsing with low ionic strength buffer The vesicle dispersion was prepared by sonication to obtain vesicles with diameter of 100-200 nm Reflectometry data collection We intend to used the MAGIK reflectometer at NCNR-NIST as this also allows for revealing off-specular reflection which can be significant considering the size of the particles We intend to use D2O and H2O buffer for characterize the adsorption of the three types of particles on two types of surfaces This will take about 36 h per particle type on the hydrophobized silica and th cate We think that the characterization of the blocks and the cationic DOTAP bilayers will take about 36 h This means that we want to request 6 days of beamtime The data will be evaluated using Motofit and as shown by the modelling in figure 2 we clearly will be able to separate between silicon substrate the starch layer on silicon and starch on DOTAP bilayer REFERENCES  Pickering S U 1907 Emulsions J Chem Soc 91 2001 -2021  Song X Pei Y Zhu W
