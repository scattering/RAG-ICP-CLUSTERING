Title Studying the pH-sensitive assembly of Azo-QPS-C16 using VSANS Scientific Background On-site targeted microbial treatment represents new strategies to prevent infection and circumvent drug accumulation in the environment Stimuli-responsive materials generate AM activity locally on-demand thus avoid systemic antibiotics and overdose potentially reduce AM resistance However in all pioneering works an external trigger either light or chemicals was required and only nonspecific broad-spectrum AM activities were delivered We propose to use VSANS to evaluate pH-sensitive assembly of Azo-QPS-C16 and chlorhexidine These pH-sensitive assemblies may detect and response to metabolic activities of acid-producing bacteria by adjusting the assembly and consequently enhancing antimicrobial efficacy responding to the acid production of cariogenic bacteriabiofilms Impact Successful completion of the proposed project will provide new approaches to make stimuli-responsive materials for drug delivery and generate materialstools for understanding the ecological role of acid-producing bacteria within a multispecies community eventually advance preventiontreatment of polymicrobial diseases such as dental caries and industrial bio-corrosion Experimental details Materials Azo-QPS-C16 C19H22BrN3O2 with different molar ratios of chlorhexidine CHX C22H30Cl2N10 in CDCl3 Molar ratio of Azo-QPS0C16 to CHX are 41 21 and 11 Samples to be evaluated empty cell CDCl3 Azo-QPS-C16 in CDCl3 CHX in CDCl3 different molar ratio of Azo-QPS0C16 to CHX in CDCl3 Temperature 25 degree C Desired Q-ranges 05 -1 to 210-3 -1 Anticipated run times one measurement per sample total ten samples 2 hours per sample total 16 hours Expected outcomes Base induced assembly structure Guinier Plot and radios of gyration  Y Yang V Reipa G Liu Y Meng XH Wang KP Mineart VM Prabhu WY Shi NJ Ling XS He JR Sun pH-Sensitive Compounds for Selective Inhibition of Acid-Producing Bacteria ACS Appl Mater Interfaces 1010 2018 8566-8573
