 1 Chain Alignment in Fused Deposition Modelling Impact on Interfilament Entanglement and Residual Stress Scientific Importance 3D printing has become an effective method to create prototypes and customized consumer goods Fused deposition modeling FDM is a common form of 3D printing where polymer filament is extruded at high temperature and laid down to cool and solidify forming structures in a layer by layer fashion The technology has been readily implemented to fabricate prototyping tools molds for industrial processes and tailored parts across many industrial fields1-3 While its use in industry has expanded the anisotropic mechanical properties observed in the final structure remain a hurdle to the production of mechanically robust printed parts14 In the FDM process a polymeric filament is passed through a heated nozzle and deposited in a layer by layer fashion Due to the deposition method and the complex thermal history experienced by the filaments poor diffusion and entanglement of chains in adjacent layers is observed5 This results in anisotropic properties where the printed structure is weaker perpendicular to the print direction than along the print direction Additionally the poor thermal conductivity of polymers usually results in residual stress warping and further delamination of layers Moreover recent work by Olmsted et al have reported that the unique geometry of the FDM process where the melted filament must make a 90 turn as it deposited on the surface results in alignment of the polymer chains along the deposited filament and significantly disentangles the melt6 Concurrently Peterson and coworkers7 and work in our lab have characterized the residual stresses in the printed sample by monitoring the change in structure size with annealing after printing The samples expand perpendicular to the print direction and collapse along the print direction with post-deposition annealing which is consistent with chain alignment With these results in mind it becomes important to develop methods to quantify the extent of chain alignment and understand the relationship between processing parameters materials design and polymer chain alignment interfilament diffusion and structural anisotropy to provide molecular level insight that can improve the 3D printing process Preliminary Work Our group has focused on material design as a pathway to improve the isotropy of FDM fabricated structures which remains a key aspect in advancing the FDM process In these studies we have found that the introduction of low molecular weight polymeric species that surface segregate results in drastic improvements to the layer adhesion bonding of adjacent filaments and mechanical isotropy8-11 These low molecular weight surface segregating additives deemed LMW-SuSAs function two-fold First LMW-SuSAs preferentially segregate to the interface where increased entanglement between adjacent printed layers is afforded by the better diffusion of the LMW species compared to their bulky and slow counterparts Secondly LMW-SuSAs act as a plasticizer where-in interfilamentous voids are minimized Importantly the molecular characteristics of the additive including molecular  05 cm sample top sample bottom Fig 1 Sample geometry and scattering environment that allows control of beam on a single filament top bottom 2 weight and architecture have a large impact on the ability of the additive to improve the bonding and adhesion of printed layers Thus a balance between the plasticization and entanglement of the additive is vitally important to producing robust and more isotropic printed objects At the same time our group has begun to examine the impact of the presence of these LMW-SuSAs on the residual stress found in the printed objects finding that the presence of the LMW-SuSAs modifies the amount of residual stress which would imply that the extent of chain alignment is altered by the presence of the LMW-SuSAs This has led us to attempt to use small angle neutron scattering to monitor the chain alignment where deuteration of the chain provides a unique mechanism to monitor the chain orientation in the bulk Working with Liz Kelley at NIST a sample holder was devised on a precisely moveable x y sample stage that holds a rectangular 3D printed sample such that each layer is perpendicular to the beam as shown in Figure 1 The scattering of a single layer  03 mm thick in the printed sample is then captured with the use of a 01 mm slit as aperture These preliminary experiments were completed on the 10 m NGB SANS for a printed sample that is 90 PMMA and 10 dPMMA as well as a 90 PMMA10 dPMMA blend with 3 LMW PMMA 30000 Daltons The results are shown in Figure 2 for the PMMAdPMMA sample and Figure 3 for the PMMAdPMMA blend with LMW PMMA Each of the scattering patterns show a clear anisotropy in the scattering pattern which is consistent with polymer chain alignment along the deposited filament This anisotropy is qualitatively analyzed by taking an azimuthal scan around the beam where each sample exhibits a clear peak at  0 and 180as shown in Figures 2 and 3 Most importantly the height of the peak is proportional to the extent of chain alignment and comparison of the azimuthal scans in Figures 2 and 3 clearly show that the PMMAdPMMA blend shows a much higher azimuthal peak than the sample with the low molecular weight additive Thus qualitatively these results show that the polymer chains are less aligned in the sample with the low molecular weight additive which corresponds to more robust interlayer adhesion and less anisotropic samples689 More importantly these results clearly demonstrate that SANS can be used to monitor polymer chain alignment in 3D printed samples and we propose an experimental plan to extend these results so that they may be more quantitatively analyzed and to monitor the impact of printing parameters and materials design on polymer chain alignment in FDM Experiment Plan The preliminary results were completed on the 10m instrument and thus the sample to detector distance and minimum q is limited Inspection of Figure 2 and 3 show that the anisotropy in the scattering pattern is dominant at the lowest q range and that improved resolution and data can be obtained by using the 30m SANS at NIST to expand the low q range of the data Thus we propose a set of experiments where three rectangular samples will be printed from the same CAD file where one sample will be 90PMMA10dPMMA another will be 873PMMA97 dPMMAPMMA sample Fig 2 2D scattering pattern and azimuthal scan of 2D pattern for PMMAdPMMA sample 3 dPMMA3 LMW PMMA and the last will be printed from 100 protonated PMMA The rectangular sample as depicted in Figure 1 is ca 10 mm long The scattering pattern of each sample will be measured in the middle of the sample at 5 mm For each sample the scattering pattern will be measured around this position at three points with a displacement of 01 mm from each other to ensure that any contribution of the interfilament interface is minimized The scattering of the purely protonated sample from this position will also provide a measure of the scattering that is due to inter-filament interfaces Finally the scattering of all the samples will also be determined after they are annealed at 150 C for 2 hours This annealing procedure should allow any molecular level alignment to relax where these scattering patterns will document the extent of molecular relaxation in the printed part The data will be analyzed by two methods The azimuthal trace of the 2D scattering pattern will be extracted from the scattering data as shown in Figures 2 and 3 and analyzed to determine the extent of alignment using Walker and Wagners alignment factor Af1213 At the same time the scattering intensity vs q will be determined for 30 wedges both parallel and perpendicular to the filament where this data will be analyzed to determine the radius of gyration of the polymer chain in these orthogonal directions Both factors will provide a quantifiable measure of the molecular and nanoscale anisotropy in the printed sample Based on the preliminary experiments we expect each scattering pattern to require 4 hours to obtain sufficient statistics The above described experimental plan includes 3 samples  3 fine steps  3 annealed samples  3 fine steps  18 scattering patterns At four hours each we will require approximately 72 hours of beamtime and thus request four days to account for sample stage installation sample change and alignment It should be emphasized that these experiments are projected to be the start of a much broader research plan where similar experiments will be completed in future cycles that provide the correlation of a variety of printing parameters such as print speed head temperature and print bed temperature as well as material design including additive loading molecular weight and architecture on the extent of molecular alignment Moreover this molecular level information will be correlated to interfilament adhesion structural anisotropy and residual stress to provide crucial molecular level insight into the FDM process and its correlation to macroscopic properties References 1 Mater Des 2017 124 143-157 2 Mater Des 2004 25 7 587-594 3 Rapid Prototyp J 2002 8 4 248-257 4 Robot Comput Integr Manuf 2016 37 103-114 5 Polymer
