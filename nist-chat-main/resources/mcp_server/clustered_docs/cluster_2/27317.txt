1 Stimuli Responsive Polymers at the Surface and Interface of 2D Materials Weinan Xu PhD Assistant Professor Department of Polymer Engineering University of Akron Akron OH 44325 Background and Significance Due to the atomically thin structure and superior in-plane mechanical and electrical properties of 2D nanomaterials they have been more and more used for high performance polymer nanocomposites However the alignment and controlled assembly of those atomically thin 2D sheets at high volume fractions in a polymer matrix remain challenging random aggregation and phase separation are commonly observed On the other hand the polymer matrices in conventional nanocomposites are passive and serve only structural purpose without any functionality By combing functional polymers such as stimuli-responsive polymers with 2D materials a new class of adaptive and responsive hybrid materials with unprecedented functionalities can be generated Therefore the study of the interactions between 2D materials such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide MoS2 and stimuli-responsive polymers such as temperaturepH responsive ones is of great interests and fundamental value to the polymers and materials science field To overcome the limitations and achieve the objectives mentioned above we have developed a general approach to generate ultrathin and adaptive hybrid structures based on graphene and temperature responsive PolyN-isopropylacrylamide PNIPAM1 The process involves a two steps surface functionalization Fig 1a in the first step dopamine was used to self-polymerize into an ultrathin polydopamine film on the surface of graphene the noncovalent interaction between graphene and polydopamine preserves the intrinsic high conductivity of graphene In the second step end-group functionalized PNIPAM brushes were chemically grafted to the surface of polydopamine In this way ultrathin 5-10 nm temperature responsive hybrid graphene can be generated Combing the surface functionalization with microfabrication we further patterned the ultrathin responsive graphene into well-defined shapes such as the flower shape in Fig 1b Interestingly the one side functionalized responsive graphene shows self-folding behavior Fig 1b-d when heated in aqueous condition above the lower critical solution temperature 33 oC of PNIPAM and such ultrathin well-defined 3D structures are promising platform for biosensing and bioelectronics23 Despite the exciting results in the temperature induced shape transformation and their biosensing applications the fundamental study at the molecular level on the interaction between responsive polymers and 2D materials has not been systematically conducted It is expected that such intimate contact and strong confinement with ultrathin 2D materials can significantly change the structure and dynamics of stimuli-responsive polymers Fig 1 a The surface functionalization of monolayer graphene with polydopamine and PNIPAM brushes b Temperature induced self-folding of the micropatterned responsive graphene scale bas are 100 m 2 This proposed study is focused on the structure and dynamics ultrathin hybrid 2D sheets composed of 2D materials and stimuli-responsive polymer brushes Firstly comparative study of the chain conformation and phase behaviors of responsive polymers in free form solution and on the surfaceinterface of 2D materials will be conducted Secondly the morphological changes and intermolecular assembly of the ultrathin hybrid 2D sheets upon external stimuli such as temperature or pH changes will be studied Thirdly the effect of intrinsic property differences of various 2D materials graphene oxide graphene MoS2 BN on their interaction with responsive polymers will be systematically studied For the proposed study small angle neutrons scattering SANS stands out as the most suitable tool due to its high resolution noninvasive convenience of isotope labelling and the capability of in situ study in liquid environment Other techniques such as dynamic light scattering DLS does not have high enough resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS has limited probing depth and require high vacuum environment The SANS experiments will be complemented by atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy as well as molecular dynamics simulation to achieve an unprecedented deep level understanding of the system Experimental Approach 2D materials synthesis and hybrid 2D sheets preparation The graphene oxide is synthesized by Hummers method and reduced graphene oxide is obtained by chemical reduction of graphene oxide MoS2 and BN are synthesized by liquid exfoliation with high power sonication The surface functionalization with responsive polymer is achieved by the method mentioned earlier basically polymer brushes are grafted to the surface through an ultrathin polydopamine intermediate layer It is worth to mention that 2D materials with both sides functionalized or only one side functionalized can both be achieved To get the one side functionalized 2D material the 2D sheets are firstly dispersed at the airwater interface and subsequent functionalized is conducted for the side in contact with water It is expected that those two types of hybrid 2D sheet will have significantly different interfacial behaviors and properties In situ SANS measurements at different temperature The hybrid ultrathin 2D sheets are dispersed in D2O or D2OH2O mixture depending on the scattering contrast needs The dispersion is loaded inside the demountable titanium cells and sealed with two quartz windows There are several important variables to be controlled for a systematic study The first one is free polymers vs polymers grafted on 2D materials The second variable is the polymer brush density and length The third variable is external stimuli including various temperature and pH conditions for thermal and pH sensitive polymers The last one is the type of the 2D materials graphene oxide graphene MoS2 BN SANS measurements will be conducted at the NG7 SANS in collaboration with Dr Yimin Mao The required Q range of the experiment is from 0002 1 to 06 1 The estimated number of samples or measurements is around 60 each measurement takes approximately 1 to 15 hours so we would like to have 5 days of beam time if possible Previous Experience with Neutron Scattering Weinan Xu has been a frequent user of the High Flux Isotope Reactor SANS and Spallation Neutron Source SANS at ORNL during his PhD study representative results include SANS studies on star shaped polyelectrolytes and polymer microcapsules in collaboration with Dr Yuri Melnichenko and Dr William Heller at ORNL Those studies result in several publications in journals like Macromolecules456The proposal study has been discussed with the beamline scientist Dr Yimin Mao References 3 1 Xu W Qin Z Chen C Kwag H R Ma Q Sarkar A Buehler M J Gracias D H Ultrathin
