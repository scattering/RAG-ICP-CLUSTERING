Observation of melting of magnetic skyrmion lattice in MnSi by electric current D Okuyama and T J Sato Scientific background A topologically nontrivial magnetic structure motion under an electric current has been studied for decades For example the motion of the superconducting flux-line in type-II superconductor is well investigated  A magnetic skyrmion a nontrivial swirling spin structure carrying a topological quantum number has been attracting interests because its finite scalar spin chirality generates fictitious magnetic field acting on the conduction elections giving rise to the nontrivial topological Hall effect in electron transport phenomena  It can be expected that the magnetic skyrmion motion is driven by the current flow resulting in deformation rotation and translation of the skyrmion lattice Recently we successfully built up the experimental setting at NG7 for the observation of the magnetic skyrmion reflection in MnSi paying careful attention towards keeping any thermal gradient as small as experimentally achievable  The temperature gradient was confirmed to be less than 0035 Kmm at the sample region under an electric current density 27 MAm2 which is enough higher than the threshold current density jt to move the skyrmion lattice in MnSi In this setting we performed small angle neutron scattering SANS experiment to obtain microscopic information how the skyrmion lattice to move in MnSi sample We observed a broadening of the reflection peaks of the skyrmion lattice for a current density j  jt and also found that this peak broadening is due to a spatially inhomogeneous rotation of the skyrmion lattice By measuring opposing-sample edges right- and left-edges we observed counter-rotating behavior to the azimuthal direction of the SANS pattern in the driving skyrmion lattice See figure 1 which indicates the existence of the local shear stress to the skyrmion lattice trapped by the impurity pinning potential We further observed an intriguing memory effect for this peak broadening and the rotation of the skyrmion lattice indicating that the driven skyrmion lattice keeps its triangular lattice structure at least up to the current density 27 MAm2 with deforming like a plastic matter plastic deformation above jt This is the first experiment to observe the shear-flow state of the moving skyrmion lattice which is not observed at superconducting flux-line in the earlier works  Proposed experiment Our next target is to apply more higher current density on MnSi sample and observe the response of the moving magnetic skyrmion lattice For example in the superconducting flux-line lattice the various moving states such as the plastic flow and the coherently moving flux crystal moving lattice state is observed under the electric current  At more higher current density the melting of the superconducting flux-line lattice is also observed It is very intriguing question whether such kinds of plastic flow moving lattice state and melting take place in the magnetic skyrmion lattice under high current density or not In our previous experiment we finally determine the detail condition of the moving skyrmion lattice and develop how to measure them Thus we will try the experiment with measuring the edges of the sample under much higher direct current density DC up to  5 MAm2 which has been successfully done in our test experiment at NG7 In our experiment we will observe the spatial inhomogeneous shear deformation near sample edge using 02 mm x 1 mm size incident neutron To obtain the SANS data in Fig 1 a we measured 20 minutes for one data We would like to current density dependence at left- and right-edges and center position of the sample under various temperature and magnetic field with more higher statistics  30 minutes Thus the required measurement time is estimated as follow 12 hours for one measuremen x 6 temperature and magnetic field x 15 current density x 2 position of the sample left and right  90 hours for this target For preparation of the cryostat and magnet we need additional 6 hours Thus we would like to request 4 days beamtime in total References  U Yaron P L Gammel D A Huse R N Kleiman C S Oglesby E Bucher B Batlogg D J Bishop K Mortensen and K N Clausen Nature 376 1995 753  N Nagaosa and Y Tokura Phys Scr T146 2012 014020  D Okuyama M Bleuel J S White Q Ye J Krzywon G Nagy Z Q Im I Zivkovic M Bartkowiak H M Ronnow S Hoshino J Iwasaki N Nagaosa A Kikkawa Y Taguchi Y Tokura D Higashi J D Reim Y Nambu and T J Sato Commun Phys 2 79 2019 Fig 1 SANS measured from the left-edge or right-edge of the sample as illustrated in a The skyrmion reflections respectively measured at j  0 j  jt and at the left-edge right-edge b Schematic illustration of the skyrmion lattice rotation at j  jt Red bars are guides to eye for the rotation direction of the skyrmion lattice
