Geometrically frustrated systems continue to challenge our understanding of hard condensed matter Conventional magnetic orders sometimes-even if survived at low temperatures-lead to novel states of magnetism Of particular interest is a nontrivial spin texture where the geometrical frustration act as a source of noncollinear spin arrangement It has been recognized as an important ingredient for swirling magnetic structure instead of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in materials without the inversion symmetry Some geometrically frustrated magnets show a spiral magnetic structure where magnetic moments rotate along the propagation vector That gives rise to the double degeneracy of handedness for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation aka spin helicity The spin helicity governs magnetic properties and is a quintessential degree of freedom in spintronics it is thus of great interest how it can be controlled by external electromagnetic fields In the case of insulators the electromagnetic coupling has been extensively investigated in the field of multiferroics Successful control of the spin helicity was made for instance in ZnCr2O4  and TbMnO3  These achieved controls of the spin helicity are well accounted for by the theory  In the case of metals on the other hand the coupling between the helicity and electric currents has eluded experimental observations A theoretical work  motivates us to experimentally confirm this potential new avenue toward the control Based on the theoretical proposal we have quite recently observed it in an itinerant helimagnet Our experiment was performed under simultaneous applications of magnetic field H and electric current I through the second harmonic term of the electric resistivity measurements  Multiple conditions indicate the successful control being dependent on the sign of H times I Fig 1 These observations are limited in the Q-summation regime we thus demanded this to be directly confirmed at the specific Q-position using the chiral term in polarized neutron scattering technique Our previous neutron experiment on BL15 TAIKAN at J-PARC has been partly successful because of a lack of a sample environment with high magnetic fields For the successful switching of the spin helicity 5 T of the magnetic field is at least necessary however it was limited up to 1 T due to the sample environment capability at J-PARC In the experiment instead of the control by changing fields we focused on temperature change across the ferromagnetic transition temperature at 290 K As shown in Fig 2a when the sample was cooled from 60 K the chiral term shows always negative irrespective of field strengths Only the application of the field at 300 K followed by cooling makes the sign change of the chiral term visible Fig 2b Since our previous preliminary experiment shows experimental feasibility and the spin helicity control through applications of H and I seem more or less likely a real experiment with satisfaction of the sample environment will be necessary As observed in Ref  we aim for tracing the fan to conical transition by decreasing fields at a fixed temperature Given that the transition from the fan to conical phases occurs in a second-order fashion it will be more promising than temperature elevation We thus sincerely propose an experiment that measures the first direct observation of the spin helicity control in a metallic magnet using NG7 SANS at NCNR NIST In the proposed experiment on NG7 we plan to use a high-quality single crystal of MnP being put in the horizontal field superconducting magnet maximum field 7 T on the horizontal HK zone notation defined in Pbnm The experiment will start by setting the instrument for the unpolarized mode at the magnetic Bragg reflection at 0112 0 0 rlu Q  013 1A and the magnetic field will be set to parallel to Q approximately perpendicular to ki We then go to the polarized mode with neutron polarization being parallel to Q Px and will measure flipper-on and flipper-off channels through the half-polarized mode upper stream polarized downstream not analyzed We discussed the plan with Dr Kathryn Krycka and concluded it seems feasible The subtracted intensity from each other for both channels corresponds to the chiral term and it will be collected with applications of H and I A care will be taken on the sample preparation for wiring to an electric current source to minimize the contact resistance and enhance the electric current density One of the proposers YN has several experiences in a similar multiple sample environment and they were successful to apply 3 x 106 Am2 with a help of Dr Qiang Alan Ye  This technique will be exported to the proposed experiment and we are quite sure that the application will be made This experiment will significantly advance our understanding of the spin helicity control in metallic magnets and will shed new light into the research fields of frustrated magnetism and spintronics as well  K Shiratori et al J Phys Soc Jpn 48 1111 1980  Y Yamasaki et al Phys Rev Lett 98 147204 2007  H Katsura et al Phys Rev Lett 95 057205 2005  O Wessely et al Phys Rev B 79 104433
