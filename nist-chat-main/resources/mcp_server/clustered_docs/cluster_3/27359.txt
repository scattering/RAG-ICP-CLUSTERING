Probing Interfacial Magnetic Order in LaSrCrO3-LaSrMnO3 heterostructures Scientific Motivation and Description of Proposed Work The ability to tune the orbital structural and electronic degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides has led to the emergence of novel properties at complex oxide interfaces Routes to engineer the orbital degrees of freedom include symmetry breaking at film surfaces and interfaces and epitaxial strain using atomic-scale growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy For the rare-earth manganites where a complex interplay between structural charge orbital and spin degrees of freedom leads to a wide range of intriguing phenomena including metal-insulator transitions magnetic transitions charge and orbital ordering and colossal magnetoresistance detangling the effects of the competing order parameters remains challenging We propose to use temperature-dependent neutron reflectivity measurements to verify the role of strain and confinement on the relative magnetic ordering of Mn and Cr ions in M La07Sr03CrO3  N La07Sr03MnO3 superlattice samples where M2 unit cells and N2 -4unit cells SQUID magnetometry measurements indicate that a net ferromagnetic ground state is stabilized in the LSCOLSMO heterostructures with a net magnetization and Curie temperature which depend on the ratio of the LSCO and LSMO thicknesses1 XMCD measurements carried out at the Advanced Light Source on the samples indicate that within the individual LSMO and LSCO layers the spins are ferromagnetically coupled however the LSMO and LSCO layers are antiferromagnetically coupled to each other Based on this observation an analysis of the SQUID data indicates a moment of 34 BMn in the LSMO layers and -20 BCr in the LSCO layers These moments are close to expected bulk moments indicating that in ultrathin LSMO layers 2-5 unit cells bulklike magnetic ordering may be stabilized as a result of the interfacial coupling with the LSCO layers However a direct determination of the magnetic moments remains particularly since spin canting may also account for the observed reduced magnetization Additionally we find above 2 unit cells of LSMO in the LSCOLSMO heterostructures there is a strong dependence of the magnetization on the magnitude of the applied strain For heterostructures on LSAT where the strain is minimal 05 compressive strain the net magnetization plateaus after N6 in N LSMO 2 LSC superlattices whereas in heterostructures grown on LaAlO3 where the strain is 2 the net magnetization does not reach the expected value of 34-37 uBMn as the LSMO thickness is increased A plausible cause of the divergent behavior observed in Figure 2c may be related to strain-induced Jahn-Teller effects which leads to orbital ordering on the Mn and Cr sites The Jahn-Teller distortion of the Mn and Cr d-eg orbital leads to a lowering of the in-plane oriented dx2-y2 orbitals for tensile strained heterostructures grown on STO 2-5 Under compressive strain a reversal of the orbital ordering ie lowering of d z2-r2 is expected which would lead to FM exchange between the Cr and Mn layers and in-plane AFM ordering in the LSMO planes However preliminary XMCD measurements on a LSMOLSCO heterostructure on LAO indicate that the Mn-Cr super-exchange remains AFM The orbital ordering induced by epitaxial strain and the ability to control the relative thicknesses of the LSCO and LSMO layers by molecular beam epitaxy opens the door for the design of novel artificial magnetic architectures In the current proposal we plan to directly determine the ground state and room temperature magnetic order in LSCOLSMO heterostructures using polarized neutron reflectivity These results will be combined with X-ray magnetic spectroscopy and diffraction SQUID magnetometry and first principles density functional theory to elucidate the complex interplay between structural orbital and spin degrees of freedom at atomically-engineered interfaces Plan of Study 1 The following
