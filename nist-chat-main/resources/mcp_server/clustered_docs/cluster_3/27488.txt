Polarized Neutron Scattering on Magnon-Phonon Coupling in Yttrium Iron Garnet Y3Fe5O12 Tong Chen and Pengcheng Dai Rice University Scientific Background Spin waves magnons and phonons are propagating disturbances of the ordered magnetic moment and lattice vibrations respectively They constitute two fundamental quasiparticles in a solid and can couple together to form a hybrid quasiparticle 1  Since our current understandings of the quasiparticles are based on linearized models that ignore all high-order terms than the quadratic term and neglect interactions among the quasiparticles themselves  magnons and phonons are believed to be stable and unlikely to interact and break down for most purposes  Therefore discovering and understanding how otherwise stable magnons and phonons can couple and interact with each other to influence the electronic properties of solids are one of the central themes in modern condensed matter physics In general spin-lattice magnon-phonon coupling can modify magnons in two different ways First a static lattice distortion induced by the magnetic order may affect the anisotropy of magnon exchange couplings Second dynamic lattice vibrations interacting with time-dependent spin waves may give rise to significant magnon-phonon coupling 5 One possible consequence of such coupling is to create energy gaps in the magnon dispersion at the nominal intersections of magnon and phonon modes 7 as seen in the antiferromagnet YLuMnO3 Alternatively the magnon-phonon coupling may give rise to spin-wave broadening at the magnon-phonon crossing points 1 In both cases we expect the integrated intensity of hybridized excitations at the intersecting points to be the sum of separate magnon and phonon scattering intensities without spin-lattice coupling  Previous Results We carried out inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the triple-axis spectrometer SPINS at NCNR MD to map out low-energy spin-waves and acoustic phonons of the magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet YIG at 100 K as a function of increasing magnetic field By comparing the zero and 91 T data we found that instead of splitting and opening gaps at the spin waves and acoustic phonon dispersion intersections points magnon-phonon coupling in YIG enhances the hybridized scattering intensity These results are different from the expectations of conventional spin-lattice coupling 1 To further understand the enhancement of the scattering we performed polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the triple-axis spectrometer HB-1 at ONRL TN We mapped out the spin-waves at three different wave vectors in 05 T and 6 T magnetic field and found only enhancement in the spin-flip channel Due to the lack of resolution on HB-1 however the data quality is not good enough for publication Proposed Experiment We propose to revisit the enhancement with the polarized setup on the multi-axis crystal spectrometer MACS at NCNR MD We prepared a large single crystal 2 g of good quality aligned in HHL scattering plane To avoid multi-domains in the sample we will apply the vertical field along 1 -1 0 direction To map out 1-8 meV with 1 meV step 2 channels 3 different field the magnon dispersion around 2 2 0 in spin-flip and non-spin-flip channels we request 5 days of beam time 8 energies  2 channels  3 fields  2 hoursenergy channel field  beam time loss  5 days Reference  W Heisenberg Z Phys 49 619 1928  S W Lovesey Theory of Thermal Neutron Scattering from Condensed Matter Vol 2 Chap 9  L D Landau Sov Phys JETP 3 920 1957  M E Zhitomirsky and A L Chernyshev Rev Mod Phys 85 219 2013  A Kamra H Keshtgar P Yan and G E W Bauer Phys Rev B 91 104409 2015  K Shen and G E W Bauer Phys Rev Lett 115 197201 2015  E Anda J Phys C 9 1075 1976  S C Guerreiro and S M Rezende Phys Rev B 92 214437 2015  J Oh et al Nat Commun 7 13146 2016 1 P Dai et al Phys Rev B 61 9553 2000 1 Man Haoran et al Physical Review B 9610 2017 100406 b c d Figure 1 a Magnon and phonon dispersions of YIG at 100 K and different magnetic fields b Expanded view of the blue and red boxes in a c-d Comparison of the estimated QE as a function of increasing wave vector at 0 T black and 91 T red c and d correspond to left and right part of b respectively 1 Figure 2 a-c Similar measurements as showed in Fig 1c and d with polarized neutron setup on HB-1 The red arrows indicate potential intensity enhancement when magnon and phonon dispersions crossover a
