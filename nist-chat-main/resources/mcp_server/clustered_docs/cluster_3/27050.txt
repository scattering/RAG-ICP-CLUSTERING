Measuring flux exclusion in a new class of superconducting metamaterials Peter Beaucage1 R Paxton Thedford2 Uli Wiesner2 1Materials Science  Engineering Division NIST 2Department of Materials Science  Engineering Cornell University Background and Previous Work Mesoscale ordering of materials allows access to properties that can be strikingly different than the bulk equivalent For example titania a brittle ceramic can tolerate massive elastic strains without fracture when ordered via two-photon lithography1 and simulations have suggested the appearance of negative refractive indices in the visible circularly polarized surface plasmon polariton propagation and a photonic bandgap in low loss metals with double space group  and alternating space group I4132 gyroid structures2 The manipulation of material symmetry via superstructure can further allow access to properties that otherwise would be symmetry-forbidden for example ferroelectricity These phenomena are expected to be particularly rich in mesoscale ordered superconductors For example it is known that simple one-dimensional dot arrays can act as pinning centers and allow highly complex magnetic responses3 The pore symmetry of the gyroid differs along the 111 and 100 axes creating interesting matching and pinning effects as the crystallographic axis of the sample matches the field axis Similarly the chiral nature of the gyroid may create nonlinear magnetoelectric couplings and other new phenomena Finally the confinement of the underlying inorganic varies dramatically with orientation from ca 10 nm at surface normal to microns along dense axes Recent synthetic advances have allowed the synthesis of three-dimensionally mesoscale ordered superconductors via block copolymer self-assembly4 a route which in principle allows access to large scale crystallographically ordered domains with programmable tunability of pore size and mesostructured symmetry via the underlying self-assembly physics More recent efforts have realized the synthesis of both polycrystalline mesostructured carbonitrides with Tc comparable to bulk5 and a synthetic strategy for production of macroscopic single mesocrystals

pressures to produce single mesocrystal superconductors intitially in the double gyroid morphology with overall domain spacing ca 50 nm and pore radius ca 15 nm Figure 1 These materials show an inversion of magnetic response from type I characteristic of the underlying metal to type II as a result of their confinement a first signature of quantum metamaterial behavior Figure 2 These synthetic advances have enabled studies addressing the significant questions that remain about the magnetic response and the nature of flux exclusion from the material under the extreme confinement of a tortuous ordered mesoscale network While conventional magnetic techniques such as VSM and transport techniques have provided significant insight only SANS collected under a variety of orientations and fields can probe the spatial distribution of magnetic flux in and around this bulk 3D material and probe the new flux direction phenomena these materials are expected to exhibit Proposed Work In this first set of experiments we propose to measure the orientation-dependent structure of magnetic flux excluded from single mesocrystal superconducting indium-SiON composites using SANS The base material has single crystal diffraction in SAXS Figure 3 which should also be readily observable in SANS despite wavelength dispersity-induced peak broadening As magnetic field is applied with the material cooled below Tc ca 3 K the ordered flux penetration should modulate the diffraction observed from the underlying structure By subtracting the zero-field or above-Tc pattern from the pattern in the superconducting state the distribution of flux around the meostructure can be precisely characterized providing direct confirmation that flux is being channeled through the pores of the material Because the materials are single crystals this flux distribution can be determined not only as a function of field but also as a function of alignment of the underlying crystal domains to the field axis The gyroid mesostructure has straight-through porosity along the 100 and 111 type directions with fourfold packing of the pores in the 100 and sixfold in the 111 The rotation of the material between these directions in an applied field might be expected to result in magnetic transitions as the open porosity matches the axis of the field For this first somewhat exploratory study we anticipate measuring a series of 4 orientation points between the 100 and 111 at zero field and at a series of field points below at and above the first critical field The q-range for measurement should cover the 211 peak of the BCP just below 001 A-1 and extend as high as practical beyond that Since the sample and the ordered magnetic structure are both likely to be strong scatterers the collection time is likely to be dominated by the time to cool the magnet and exchange samples Higher resolution SANS data collection around the first critical field may also take as long as 12 h per sampleorientation The data processing will involve subtracting oriented slices of the 2D data at field from the zero-field component to isolate the magnetic contribution to the scattering which we expect will have Figure 2 Magnetometry of bulk red and mesoscale ordered blue indium showing a broadening of the transition and a switch from a type-I to a type-II magnetic response a first signature of unexpected flux exclusion behavior a similar ordered structure to the underlying metal scattering since we expect the magnetic field will be channeled into the SiON domains It should be noted that indium has a significant neutron activation cross section Using the web calculator we expect that for the largest single crystals of order 100 mg and at typical fluxes 106-107 n cm-2 s-1 for NG7 samples should be active for less than a week In the worst-case bulky samples and high flux samples may be active for an extended period however ca 1 year This activation profile also creates some safety considerations for sample exchange and rotation As an alternative we can readily prepare samples with lead or tin metallic components While the indium composites are ready at any time lead and tin infiltration have been demonstrated using our synthesis system albeit with less complete infiltration and have substantially more favorable activation profiles and similar physics therefore could be substituted as the measurement demands The understanding of the mode of flux exclusion from these superconducting metamaterials will pave the way toward the development of superconducting metamaterials more broadly a field which is expected to have impacts from power transmission to enhanced magnets for MRI and other sensing technologies More broadly the development of models for emergent behavior driven by the interactions of correlated electron systems with mesoscale ordered structure an area which is likely to be rich with potential applications in quantum computing and
