Investigation of Depth-Dependent Magnetic Properties and Their Impacts on Skyrmion Stability in Amorphous Ferrimagnetic GdCo Chung Ting Ma Wei Zhou and Joseph Poon Department of Physics University of Virginia Brian Kirby NIST Center for Neutron Research Amorphous ferrimagnetic rare-earth transition-metal thin films have been widely investigated for their applications in high-density low-current spintronics devices Recently inhomogeneous depth profiles have been reported in these thin films In GdFeCo films composition asymmetry was found throughout the magnetic layer  Moreover in a previous study with polarized neutron reflectometry PNR the magnetization near the substrate surface was revealed to exhibit different temperature dependence from the rest of the sample  Even though the composition of GdFeCo appeared to be uniform throughout the sample an interface region showed different compensation temperature from the rest of the sample It was speculated that changes in short-range order near the interface gave rises to this intriguing behavior Nevertheless having such inhomogeneous magnetic depth profile would potentially hinder the feasibility of using thin ferrimagnetic films for device applications Recently we have employed atomistic simulations to study room temperature skyrmions in ferrimagnetic GdCo  and have now moved on to experimental studies We began with W3 nmPt3GdCo5W3Pt3 multilayers grown on thermally oxidized Si substrates by magnetron sputtering Figure 1 shows the out-of-plane hysteresis loop for 5 nm GdCo samples at 300 K as measured by vibrating sample magnetometry Figure 1 Out-of-plane hysteresis loops of 5 nm GdCo at 300 K by magnetron sputtering The hysteresis loop reveals coercivity of 250 Oe and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy PMA in this GdCo sample Temperature-dependent PNR measurements of this sputtered sample in a 3 T in-plane field using PBR have again revealed an inhomogeneous magnetic profile as shown in Figure 2 We observed two distinct magnetic sublayers that maintain antiparallel orientation despite the large in-plane field -15-1-05005115-1000 -500 0 500 1000Normalized Magnetization Magnetic Field Oe Out-of-plane M vs H 300 K 5 nm GdCo bymagnetronsputteringbut go to zero magnetization at similar temperatures Thus we conclude that these sublayers are very strongly antiferromagnetically coupled with similar ferrimagnetic compensation temperatures ie the temperature where the magnetizations of the AF coupled Gd and Co perfectly cancel out In addition to being a fascinating example of a fractal ferrimagnet two ferrimagnetic layers also acting as a composite synthetic ferrimagnet such inhomogeneity can have significant impact in device applications Figure 2 PNR results for sputtered GdCo measured in a 3 T in-plane field a Fitted data plotted as spin asymmetry b Nuclear profile c Temperature dependent magnetic profile d Line cuts from the magnetic profiles There are 2 distinct antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublayers that exhibit similar ferrimagnetic compensation temperatures As a next step we wish to determine if the observed inhomogeneity is somehow intrinsic to thin GdCo films or if it is instead due to growth imperfections Thus we propose to use PNR to measure the magnetic depth profile of a sample nominally identical to the previous sputtered sample but grown by biased target ion beam deposition BTIBD BTIBD is an atomic layer deposition method This technique should greatly reduce the energy of deposition and should improve the quality of these thin films Figure 3 shows the out-of-plane hysteresis loop for BTIBD-grown W3 nmPt3GdCo5W3Pt3 at 300 K The hysteresis loops show coercivity of 150 Oe and PMA similar to the sample grown by magnetron sputtering Here we propose to use PBR to measure the magnetic depth profiles of the BTIBD-grown sample We will the same procedures as we did for the data shown in Figure 2 - ie 50 K to 300 K in a 3 T saturating field From our previous experience we expect each scan to require 12 hours Thus factoring in setup we are requesting 5 days of beamtime Figure 3 Out-of-plane hysteresis loops of 5 nm GdCo at 300 K by BTIBD References  Kim L et al Bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in amorphous ferrimagnetic alloys Nat Mater 18 685-690 2019  Ma CT Kirby BJ Li X and Joseph Poon S Thickness dependence of ferrimagnetic compensation in amorphous rare-earth transition-metal thin films Appl Phys Lett 113 172404 2018  Ma C T et al Robust Formation of Ultrasmall Room-Temperature Nel Skyrmions in Amorphous Ferrimagnets from Atomistic Simulations Sci Rep 9 9964 2019 -15-1-05005115-1000 -500 0 500 1000Magnetization  emucc Magnetic Field Oe Out-of-plane M vs H 300 K 5 nm GdCo byBTIBD
