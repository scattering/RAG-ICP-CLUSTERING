Investigating the electromagnetic proximity effect in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures Introduction There is currently intense experimental and theoretical interest in new proximity effects at the interface between superconducting and magnetic materials Advances in thin-films and nanolithography allow the use of artificial heterostructures to explore such an interface in great detail New physics at the interface arises as a result of the competing order parameters Typically such interfaces are probed by transport measurements characterising the leakage of the superconducting pair correlations into the ferromagnet For homogeneous ferromagnetism the lengthscale of the leakage is described by the effective coherence length F and is short ranged 1-2 nm The fabrication of Josephson junctions for the study of these effects is an area of expertise for our group1 A very recent theoretical work has studied the opposite effect the leakage of magnetism into the superconductor2 The electromagnetic proximity effect found has three important characteristics which make it ripe for study by neutron reflectometry 1 the leakage of magnetism into the superconductor is long ranged occurring over the lengthscale of the London penetration depth about 90 nm for our sputtered Nb 2 the induced magnetism can be tuned to give either paramagnetic or diamagnetic response And 3 this effect occurs in the absence of either an applied field or stray fields from the ferromagnet penetrating the superconductor Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of this effect for the case of an SF bilayer Figure 1 a shows the case where a superconductor S and ferromagnet F are not in electronic proximity In the absence of stray fields there is no penetration of magnetic order into the superconductor b shows an SF bilayer in electronic proximity Now the magnetism leaks into the superconductor by the electromagnetic proximity effect The figure shows both paramagnetic and diamagnetic response which can be tuned by changing the thickness of the F layer Reproduced from reference  Previous Research Prior to the theoretical description of the electromagnetic proximity effect some experimental reports may have serendipitously found the diamagnetic component3-7 The most striking used the low energy muon technique to study the Meissner expulsion in NSF type samples where N is a normal metal45 These studies found that Meissner expulsion is significantly enhanced when a ferromagnet is present and that the induced magnetism can extend throughout the structure into the normal metal which is separated from the F layer by 50 nm of superconducting Nb A previous attempt to measure these effects with PNR was performed with the weak ferromagnet CuNi coupled to a thin Nb layer 57 nm4 That system was not shown to significantly modify the proximity effect which may have been due to CuNi having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which the theoretical work8 shows explicitly will not give rise to the type of effects we wish to study here and the thickness of the superconductor being well below the length scale of the effect the London penetration depth in that work was 120 nm While these studies were able to uncover a hint of this effect they were certainly not optimised It is now predicted for example that reducing the thickness of the ferromagnet and increasing the thickness of the superconductor considered in those works may significantly boost the size of the effect To optimise our samples we undertook a Josephson junction study of NiNb-based systems in which the electromagnetic proximity effect manifests in the Fraunhofer patterns of our junctions The results of this study suggested an optimal thickness of Ni  28 nm should be used for the neutron experiments Figure 2 Spin Asymmetry SA of the PNR on a SiNi28Nb200 and SiNi28AlOx3Nb200 sample measured left and preliminary fit of the SiNi28Nb200 which suggests evidence of the electromagnetic proximity effect at 15 kOe and 3 K right So far in this study we have undertaken neutron reflectivity measurements on SiNb28Nb200 and SiNb28AlOx3Nb200 at 10 Oe and 15 kOe The 15 kOe results for these samples are presented in Figure 2 and shows data above and below the superconducting transition temperature the 10 Oe spin asymmetry showed now discernible difference above and below Tcrit In Fig 2b we show preliminary modelling for a combination of ferromagnetic Ni Meissner screening and the electromagnetic proximity effects However we also find that the Nb penetration depth is dramatically larger than measured in previous single Nb film samples by the same group which could potentially be due to flux creeping in from the formation of a superconducting vortex state In order to determine if the penetration depth change is due to the sample or vortex formation we will carry out an additional measurement at 500 Oe well below Hc1 for Nb We will also collect a series of low Q scans at several temperatures on the NiNb sample in order to constrain the temperature dependence of Nis magnetization Furthermore our early modelling is suggestive of a large magnetic dead layer in the Ni but given that prior scans were only taken out to low Q one room temperature scan out to higher Q will be taken to pin down this dead layer Neutron Experiment In order to aid with our modelling and interpretation of the data presented in Figure 2 we propose to perform neutron reflectometry on our NiNb and NiinsulatorNb samples at one final field condition of 500 oe Our samples have been grown at Michigan State University and will be of the form SisubNi28 nmNbnon-superconducting spacerAlOx3 nmNb200 nm The role of the additional AlOx insulating barrier is to remove the electronic proximity effect from the sample and the non-superconducting Nb spacer layer 3 nm thick is to stop alloying between the Ni and Al or diffusion of oxygen from the AlOx into the Ni We will perform PNR on this sample under the same conditions as those used to obtain the data presented in Figure 2 in order to compare the responses of samples with and without the electromagnetic proximity effect PNR will be measured at the PBR using the 07 T electromagnet and a field of 4 mT will be applied after saturating the sample above the critical temperature The field will be oriented in-plane and perpendicular to the scattering vector The sample will first be measured below the critical temperature 3 K The high powered CCR which was first demonstrated to work on the PBR during previous beam time on this experiment allows for temperatures as low as 29 K will be used Scan times will be focused on the low Q regime where Figure 2 demonstrates the signature of these effects lie Finally we will take a series of low Q scans from 10 to 300 K to account for temperature dependence of Nis magnetization and one high Q scan to help with modelling the magnetic dead layers Based on prior measurements we predict each measurement above the critical temperature to take 12 hours and below to take 48 hours Thus we request a total of 5 days of beam time References 1 Birge N O Phil Trans R Soc A 376 20150150 2018 2 Mironov S Melnikov A S  Buzdin A Appl Phys Lett 113 022601 2018 3 Khaydukov Y N et al JETP Lett 98 107-110 2013 4
