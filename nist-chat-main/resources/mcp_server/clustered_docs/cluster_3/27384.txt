Magnetic Structure Determination of Ln2MReO6 Ln  Pr and Nd M  Co and Ni Fang Yuan and Corey Thompson Department of Chemistry Purdue University Background Double perovskite DP oxides A2MMO6 have been intensely studied due to their interesting chemical and physical properties When 3d and 5dor 4d transition-metals occupy both M-sites interactions from the M-sublattices make A2MMO6 great candidates for spintronic applications due to the magnetic and electronic coupling1-3 Synthesis of Ca2MReO6 Sr2MReO6 and Ba2MReO6 was first reported in 1961 and 1962 respectively45 Afterwards physical properties of these compounds have been published by several researchers6-11 The magnetic properties are dominated by 3d and 5d transition-metals while non-magnetic A-site elements influence the properties via structural characteristics like octahedral tilting Replacing the non-magnetic A cation with a magnetic cation ie lanthanides Ln would create three magnetic sublattices thus potentially leading to unique magnetic phenomena The likelihood of such replacement is high since the ionic radii of these 4f elements are close to those of alkali earth metals A  Ca-112  Ln  Pr-1126  Nd-1109  In this regard our current work is focused on the synthesis structure and magnetic properties of Re5-based double perovskites Ln2MReO6 Ln  Pr and Nd M  Co and Ni The four compounds were synthesized for the first time Based on laboratory powder X-ray diffraction measurements all phases adopt the monoclinic P21n crystal structure Fig 1 Initial Rietveld refinements indicate that these are non-stoichiometric phases Ln2M133Re067O6 Temperature- and field-dependent magnetizations were measured under 1000 Oe and at 2 K respectively As shown in Figure 2 the two Co phases order magnetically below 220 K while the two Ni analogs exhibit a Curie temperature TC above 200 K In addition significant divergence between zero-field cooling ZFC and field-cooling FC curves was observed for all of the samples and reflected in the isothermal magnetization curves Fig 3 Both ZFC and FC curves manifest multiple magnetic transitions an initial indication of spin-reorientation from A-sites M-sites or both sites Hysteresis loops measured at 2 K suggests ferrimagnetic coupling for all compounds with saturation Figure 1 Powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Ln2MReO6 phases left Monoclinic crystal

discerning of the observed magnetic behavior Thus to systematically investigate the structural and magnetic behavior of Ln2M133Re067O6 Ln  Pr and Nd M  Co and Ni DPs we propose to conduct powder neutron diffraction measurements on all four samples Therefore the objective of this neutron proposal is to obtain accurate structural information including refinement of oxygen content and thermal parameters and elucidate the magnetic behavior of these materials by solving their magnetic structures Choice of Instrument The BT-1 high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer is ideally suited for studying both crystal and magnetic structures of double perovskite oxides This diffractometer can provide high resolution in a wide 2-theta range Experimental Plan To obtain accurate crystal and magnetic structures we propose to perform powder neutron diffraction experiments using the Ge 311 monochromator on the BT-1 instrument Measurements from 5 K to 300 K at 50 K increments will be performed on each sample for 4 hours each scan at wavelength 2079  Ge 311 In total we request five days to measure all four samples 1 daysample This d Figure 2 Temperature dependencies of
