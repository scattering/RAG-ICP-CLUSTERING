Magnetic structures of MnCr2O4 - MgCr2O4 spinel solid solutions the evolution of a multiferroic to a chiral spin liquid Scientific Importance The spinel chromite MnCr2O4 is interesting from the perspective of magnetoelectric and magneto-dielectric effect below the ferromagnetic transition in the Cr lattice at TN  43 K and the appearance of ferroelectricity at TS  18 K where short-range spiral spin order is onset 1 2  MnCr2O4 adopts cubic Fd-3m space group structure where the Mn2 occupies a diamond lattice and Cr3 constitutes a pyrochlore Though Mn and Cr are magnetic it is often observed that Mn2 is not orbitally active and that the magnetic properties are ascribed to Cr lattice Experimental evidence exist to support the fact that spiral short-range order and long-range ferrimagnetism coexist in MnCr2O4 Most of the studies on MnCr2O4 focused on the low temperature magnetic structure below the TN and its relation to the spiral spin state that can lead to ferroelectric polarization via an inverse Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction  On the other hand MgCr2O4 is an example of a canonical system that has the potential to realize Coulomb phase where spin correlations decay algebraically in real space and sharp features known as pinch points are observed in reciprocal space Recent neutron scattering work on MgCr2O4 identify it as a classical spiral spin liquid instead of a Coulomb phase  In order to understand the magnetism and structure of MnCr2O4 more clearly we have diluted the Mn lattice using Mg and prepared Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 In the present proposal we want to employ neutron diffraction on MnCr2O4 Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 and MgCr2O4 powders to understand and contrast their magnetism especially how the mutliferroic MnCr2O4 transforms to the chiral spin liquid MgCr2O4 Preliminary Work Polycrystalline samples of MnCr2O4 MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 were prepared via solid-state synthesis route The powder X ray diffraction pattern from MnCr2O4 powder is shown in Figure 1 Rietveld analysis confirms that MnCr2O4 adopts cubic Fd-3m space group with the lattice parameter a  843362  MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 conformed to similar diffraction pattern and Fd-3m space group The refined lattice parameters are 833352  and 839001  respectively All the three compounds are obtained as phase-pure powders The magnetometry results on MnCr2O4 MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 are presented in Figure 2 Panel a shows the magnetic susceptibility of MnCr2O4 as a function of temperature obtained under different applied fields up to 8 T A weak transition is seen at  40 K and a double peak is clearly visible at  10 K The inset of a shows the magnetization isotherms at different temperatures from 5 K to 50 K The magnetization isotherms are suggestive of antiferromagnetic response from MnCr2O4 On the other hand a ferromagnetic like magnetization isotherm is present in MgCr2O4 which shows a sharp rise in the magnetic susceptibility at  50 K and subsequently a weak feature at 18 K panel b It appears that a saturation-like state is reached at 2 K In the case of Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 a sharp peak in magnetic susceptibility is present at 16 K panel c which is suppressed in the presence of external magnetic field up to 8 T inset of c The magnetization isotherms are also presented in the inset of c showing that weak ferromagnetic loop is present at 5 K Experiment BT1 is our chosen instrument and offers the required resolution and sample environment to achieve our goals of determining the magnetic structures For the proposed diffraction experiment we intend to use powder samples of MnCr2O4 MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 We have  4 grams of powder characterized by x-rays magnetic and thermodynamic measurements available for each compound We will use the 6 mm id vanadium can available at BT1 for the measurements We are interested in collecting data at 100 K 20 K 10 K and 18 K The requested temperature points will cover the transition temperatures of MnCr2O4 MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 Considering 6-8 h for each Figure 1 The X ray diffraction pattern of MnCr2O4 is shown along with the Rietveld refinement fit black solid line This confirms phase purity of the sample and the space group in Fd-3m MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 adopt similar structure not presented measurement scan and 2-3 h for cooling down and sample changes we request 45 days of measurement time for three samples included in the present experiment proposal We note this measurement will require a He4 cryostat to reach the base temperature of 18 K The diffraction data will be analyzed using Rietveld method and the magnetic structures will be treated using representation analysis coded in the software SARAh The present set of experiments use standard experimental set-ups available at BT1 The samples are stable at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure and do not demand special care or treatment before or during the experiments Conclusions In conclusion analysis of the diffraction data of MnCr2O4 MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 should allow us to observe and study the transition of multiferroic MnCr2O4 to chiral spin liquid MgCr2O4 The nuclear structure and the crystallographic orderdisorder in MnCr2O4 MgCr2O4 and Mn05Mg05Cr2O4 shall be ascertained as well as the magnetic structures of the three compounds References  K Dey S Majumdar and S Giri Phys Rev B 90
