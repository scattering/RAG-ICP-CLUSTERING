Measurement of the Magnetic Proximity Effect in PtYIG and PtMAFO bilayers using Polarized Neutron Reflectometry Eleanor Clements Brian Kirby Joe Prestigiacomo Michael Osofsky Peng Li Yuri Suzuki Background and prior work Controlling pure spin current generation for low loss devices has motivated a significant effort to understand spin-charge conversion phenomena between ferromagnetic insulators FMI and paramagnetic heavy metals 1-1 Due to its strong spin-orbit coupling Pt is a popular material choice for prospective devices that can detect the pure spin current generated in FMI via the inverse spin Hall effect ISHE-the mechanism that converts pure spin current into charge current However studies of electronic transport on Ptmagnetic insulator bilayers eg Anomalous Hall Effect AHE and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveal a magnetic proximity effect MPE whereby magnetization is induced into the Pt layer 23101 The appearance of AHE brought about by spin polarization in Pt contaminates the ISHE complicating the interpretation of the spin current generation in FMI  Two characteristics of the MPE are of particular interest and need to be quantified for practical devices the characteristic length scale of the MPE and the transport spin polarization P of the induced polarized electrons To characterize the effects of MPE our team has performed initial studies of the AHE and spin polarization using point contact Andreev reflection PCAR 1 on Pt  YIG and Pt  MgAl05Fe15O4 10 nm MAFO 16 1 bilayers with Pt thicknesses ranging from 5 - 50 nm MAFO represents a new class of low loss spinel ferrites Fig 1 Epitaxial MAFO films with TC  400 K exhibit extremely low damping with a Gilbert damping parameter   15 x 10-3 1 rivaling that of the canonical magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12 YIG A key advantage of MAFO is that films can be grown on a variety of substrates as opposed to YIG which requires growth on paramagnetic Gd3Ga5O12 GGG substrates with high deposition temperatures 1 Additionally the significant in-plane magnetic anisotropy leads to higher spin-wave frequencies MAFO films also have higher effective magnetization than YIG so the external field needed to excite a spin current is lower 1 Fig 1 MgAl05Fe15O4 MAFO film properties and measurements a Spinel ferrite crystal structure 1 b XRD patterns of epitaxial MAFO grown on MgAl2O4 substrates 1 c In-plane static magnetization of epitaxial MAFO along easy 11 and harder 10 directions 1 d Anomalous Hall effect measurement set-up for Pt  MAFO bilayers measurements in Fig 2 Figs 2 a-c show the proximity-induced AHE in PtMAFO bilayers The anomalous Hall coefficient RAHE decreases with the thickness of the Pt and remains present in the 50 nm sample The AHE magnitude for Pt10 nmMAFO Fig 2b approaches 0002 W similar to that observed for Pt10 nm  YIG in Ref  Fig 2 d which could suggest that the induced magnetization is limited by properties of the Pt The PCAR set-up is schematically shown in Fig 3d where a point contact is made between Nb Tc  93 K and the Pt surface at cryogenic temperatures Fig 3e shows a measurement of the normalized conductance G for Pt5 nm  MAFO at T  42 K The spin polarization remains near P  50  and is detectable for all Pt thicknesses ranging from 5 - 50 nm Figs 3f Proposed experiment and beam time request While the AHE results reflect the attenuation of the induced magnetization in the Pt layer the inferred profile of this attenuation depends on a model of the AHE in a non-uniform magnetized system Additionally the spin polarization results demonstrate that even in 50 nm Pt the MPE leads to a detectable imbalance in spin-up and spin-down channels Therefore we propose to perform polarized neutron reflectometry measurements at PBR to determine the magnetization profile into the Pt which will then be used to derive the details of the attenuation While it will be challenging to characterize the weak Pt magnetization we are encouraged by recent PBR measurements that were used to unambiguously characterize proximity induced magnetization in a similar system Tm3Fe5O12  W 1 These results will provide data that can be used to quantify the depth profile of the MPE in Pt analyze any dependence of the MPE on the properties of the FMI and validate theoretical models of the phenomenon New samples of Pt  YIG and Pt  MAFO can be easily grown using pulsed laser deposition by Yuri Suzukis group at Stanford University 16 1 For coherently-strained MAFO the saturation field along the 10 hard axes is 100  7 kA m-1 6 B and the in-plane coercivity is  05 mT for both the easy and hard axes Fig 1 For each film we will measure non spin-flip reflectivities for three temperatures T  6 30 and 300 K with an in-plane magnetic field 0H  100 mT From the experience gathered from 1 we expect each measurement to take at least 24 hours thus factoring in setup and sample changes we request 7 days of beamtime Fig 2 Anomalous Hall effect in Pt  MAFO bilayers a Anomalous Hall coefficient versus magnetic field and temperature for 5 nm Pt b-c Thickness dependence of RAHE d RAHE for Pt 10 nm  YIG from Ref  which is comparable to the magnitude measured in our Pt 10 nm  MAFO measurements RAHE  t -11a b c d References 1 S Y Huang et al Phys Rev Lett 109 107204 2012 2 S Geprags et al Appl Phys Lett 101 262407 2012 3 Y M Lu et al Phys Rev Lett 110 147207 2013 4 Y Yang et al J of Appl Phys 115 17C509 2014 5 S Meyer et al Appl Phys Lett 106 132402 2015 6 T Shang et al Phys Rev B 92 165114 2015 7 X Zhou et al Phys Rev B 92 060402R 2015 8 R Gao et al Jap J of Appl Phys 55 045801 2016 9 B F Miao et al Phys Rev B 94 174430 2016 10 T Kikkawa et al Phys Rev B 95 214416 2017 11 M Collet et al Appl Phys Lett 111 202401 2017 12 Y K Liu et al J of Mag And Mag Mat 468 235 2018 13 M Lohmann et al Nano Lett 19 2397 2019 14 F Magnus et al Nat Commun 711931 doi 101038ncomms11931 2016 15 R J Soulen Jr et al Science 282 85 1998 16 L Riddiford et al Appl Phys Lett 115 122401 2019 17 S Emori et al Nano Lett 2018 18 42734278 18 Qiming Shao et al Phys Rev B 99 104401 2019 19 Hu Bolin Crystal growth of hexaferrite architecture for magnetoelectrically tunable microwave semiconductor integrated devices 2015 Fig 3 Point contact Andreev reflection PCAR a-c From Ref 1 A point contact between a superconductor and normal metal with zero spin polarization P  0 results in an Andreev reflected hole causing a doubling of the conductance G No Andreev reflection occurs if the P  100  in the metal Plots of normalized G for various metals with spin polarization ranging from P  0 -
