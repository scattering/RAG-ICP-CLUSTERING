Magnetic excitation in frustrated spin chain system A2Cu2Mo3O12 A  Rb Cs S Hayashida and A Zheludev Laboratory for Solid State Physics ETH Zurich Switzerland 1 Scientific background Frustrated S  12 spin chain with competing nearest-neighbor J1 and next-nearest-neighbor J2 interactions is a simple but excellent field for study unusual quantum states such as chiral spin liquids and spin nematics  One of the most intriguing species is the linear chain molybdate A2Cu2Mo3O12 A  Rb Cs  It is believed to feature a competition of ferromagnetic J1  -135 K and antiferromagnetic J2  51 K J2J1  037 for the Rb compound and J1  -93 K and J2  33 K J2J1  035 for the Cs one  A2Cu2Mo3O12 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure and CuO4 plaquettes form one-dimensional chains along the crystallographic b axis Fig 1a The Rb compound exhibits nonmagnetic gapped ground state  while the Cs one realizes a magnetic long-range order LRO below TN  185 K  The most interesting property is a magnetic-field induced ferroelectricity below 8 K even in the absence of the magnetic LRO 5 This implies that the ferroelectricity can be driven by exotic spin-chiral order as theoretically predicted in Ref  However the underlying mechanism is poorly understood up to now 2 Preliminary work Recently we reported the first comprehensive thermodynamic study of Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 using small single crystals  mapping out the magnetic phase diagram Fig 2a If anything the results only deepened the mystery of this system For instance the saturation transition was found to be dominated by one-dimensional fluctuations while the gap closure transition is three-dimensional For Cs2Cu2Mo3O12 the magnetic phase diagram is distinct from the Rb compound Fig 2b there exists three phases in the LRO dome Without knowing the spin Hamiltonian it is difficult to move further Although some neutron spectroscopy has been performed in zero applied field  the exchange parameters cannot be unambiguously extracted from such data without building rather strong assumptions into the analysis Moreover the quality and energy range of the data appear to be rather limited 3 Proposed experiment The purpose of the present proposal is to investigate spin interaction in A2Cu2Mo3O12 by inelastic neutron scattering technique Based on what is known about the material we expect all magnetic excitations in the saturated phase to lie below about 2 meV energy transfer The data will need to be collected at dilution cryostat temperatures below 1 K The DCS spectrometer appears to be ideally suited for this task A 10 g polycrystalline sample that are already available in both compounds and no impurity was observed in x-ray powder diffraction Fig 1b We will choose the incident neutron energy of Ei  5 meV with medium resolution setup to cover the upper boundary of the spectrum Collecting data will take 2 day for each sample Sample exchange and cooling will take at least one day If the signal is weak we will collect data on Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 in whole beam time We therefore request 5 days in total The measured powder-averaged spin spectrum will be analyzed by i normalized second moment    2 2     S  d S  d  k k k and ii assumption of single mode in a spin chain It is known that the second moment in Heisenberg model is proportional to  1 cosJ      k  where J is exchange interaction and  is a vector connecting sites 1 We will examine the sum of the exchange couplings from this formula We will also simulate powder-averaged spin spectrum under the assumption of single spin wave mode in a spin chain We will compare the obtained data with the simulation in 1D model as one of the proposers performed before 1 Figure 1 a Schematic view of the crystal structure b X-ray powder diffraction pattern of Cs2Cu2Mo3O12 measured at room temperature Figure 2 Magnetic phase diagram for a Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 and b Cs2Cu2Mo3O12 Magnetic field is applied along the b axis References  A V Chubukov Phys Rev B 44 4693 1991  M Hase et al Phys Rev B 70 104426 2004 J Appl Phys 97 10B303 2005  Y Yasui et al JPS Conf Proc 3 014014 2014  A Fujimura et al IEEE Transitions on Magnetics 52 1 2016  Y Yasui et al Phys Rev B 87 054411 2013  Y Yanagisawa Master thesis 2012 httpsrepositorykulibkyoto-uacjpdspacebitstream24331620091bussei_el_013602pdf  S Furukawa et al Phys Rev B 81 094430 2010  S Hayashida et al Phys Rev B 100 134427 2019  H Ueda et al arxiv180307081 2018 1 SW Lovesey Theory of Neutron Scattering from Condensed matter Clarendon Oxford England 1987 1 A Zheludev et al Phys Rev B 64 134415 2001
