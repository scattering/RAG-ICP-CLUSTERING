Background A quantum spin liquid QSL state in a real material has long captured an interest of experimental and theoretical condensed-matter physicists 1- Several candidate systems that can potentially host such an exotic magnetic ground state have been studied and the race for the discovery of new quantum-liquid systems is still ongoing Most systems that exhibit such unusual magnetic behaviors have been mostly discovered on minerals with the two-dimensional frustrated lattices 4- Averievite Cu5V2O10CsCl is a mineral that was recently studied and proposed to be a building block of the QSL state via the Zn substitution at the Cu site  However the parent compound Cu5V2O10CsCl has not been carefully characterized and microscopically studied Figure 1 a The crystal structure of Cu5V2O10CsCl The averievite is composed of CuVO3 honeycomb layers b Cu3O2Cl kagome layers c and CsO2 layers separating those blocks The first second and third nearest neighbors between Cu atoms in the kagome plane have bond length 318  551  and 636  respectively Pyrochlore slabs constructed by honeycomb and kagome layers of Cu  Structurally Cu5V2O10CsCl consists of Cu3O2Cl kagome layers expanding the ab-planes These kagome layers are sandwiched by two other CuVO3 honeycomb layers stacking up along the crystallographic c-axis as shown in Fig 1 The crystal structure was found to transform from the monoclinic system with space group P3m1 to the trigonal system with space group P21c at Tc1  310 K and another structural transition at Tc2  127 K where the crystal structure below Tc2 of this system is still unidentified In terms of macroscopic magnetic properties the magnetic susceptibility reveals a broad maximum a sign of short-range correlation at 35 K after which it undergoes a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition at 24 K The large negative Curie-Weiss temperature of CW  -185 K indicates the relatively strong magnetic frustration ie f  CW TN  7 Up to date owing to the lack of clear crystal structure below 127 K as well as magnetic structure below TN we propose to study both crystal and magnetic structure of Cu5V2O10CsCl powder sample Figure 2 The profile matching refinement on the powder x-ray diffraction pattern of Cu5V2O10CsCl shows no trace of impurity phases Proposed measurements At BT1 we propose to conduct powder neutron diffraction measurements on the pure 20-g of the Cu5V2O10CsCl powder sample at low temperatures ie below 300 K Although the system was found to have the first structural phase transition at 310 K we are focusing on the magnetic properties of this system Since the system was suggested to have the second structural transformation at 127 K and the Neel temperature at 24 K we will collect the data at the base temperature 26 K and 130 K corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordered state paramagnetic state just above TN and just above the structural phase transition respectively We expect that the intensity of magnetic peaks from the ordered Cu2 S12 spins is supposedly low Hence we choose to utilize the Ge311 crystal as a monochromator with 60 collimators to maximize the intensity For all these measurements we request a total of 2 days of beam time at BT1 References  L Balents Nature 464 199 2010  S Yan D A Huse and S R White Science 332 1173 2011  M R Norman Rev Mod Phys 88 041002 2016  S -H Lee H Kikuchi Y Qiu B Lake Q Huang K Habicht and K Kiefer Nat Mater 6 853 2007  B Gao et al Nat Phys 15 1052 2019  K Matan T Ono Y Fukumoto T J Sato J Yamaura M Yano K Morita and H Tanaka Nat Phys 6 865 2010  A S Botana H Zheng S H Lapidus J F Mitchell and M R Norman Phys Rev B 98 054421 2018
