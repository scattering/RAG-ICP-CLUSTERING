Proposal Title Multiple-Q magnetic texture evolution in the anisotropic heavy-fermion compound CeNiCoGe2 1 Background and context In strongly correlated electron materials the consequences of quantum fluctuations can have a significant influence on the magnetic and electronic phases even at finite temperatures leading to exotic states of matter such as non-Fermi liquid behavior nematic electronic states and unconventional superconductivity  Recent theories have also predicted that correlated quantum metals may exhibit topologically protected f-electron magnetic states akin to skyrmions  Itinerant spin systems exhibit a multitude of magnetic interaction mechanisms leading to modulated magnetic order like Fermi surface nesting magnetic frustration induced by the RKKY interaction and mediated four and higher-order spin interactions beyond only a single-wavevector Q making them natural candidates for multi-Q magnetic states  Heavy-fermion compounds are prototypical examples of materials exhibiting quantum phase transitions In these rare-earth and transition metal-containing compounds strong electron correlations lead to a continuous screening of the unpaired f-electrons by the coherent scattering of conduction electrons changing the Fermi surface volume and dramatically increasing the effective electron mass The Nel temperature TN is driven to T  0 defining a quantum critical point as a function of a non-thermal tuning parameter  The localized f-electron moments interact via mediating itinerant electrons through the RKKY interaction As the energy scales governing these interaction mechanisms change on approaching a quantum critical point the magnetic structure may also undergo crossovers or transitions governed by non-thermal turning parameter as well as temperature CeNiGe2 is a heavy-fermion compound with highly anisotropic magnetic Fig 1b and transport properties  Doping the transition metal site with Co leads to an apparent composition-tuned quantum phase transition at critical concentration xc  03 for CeNi1-xCoxGe2 Non-Fermi liquid behavior supports the presence of 2D antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the quantum critical regime  Furthermore magnetization measurements  show only a small reduction in the 4f-moment to 222 B from the theoretical value of the single ion Ce3 254 B suggesting that Kondo screening is weak and the local moment survives for all finite temperatures approaching the quantum critical point Substitution of Co has been shown to have little to no influence on the lattice parameter unlike other ternary systems Thus doping concentration may only influence the electronic mechanisms driving changes in the spin texture  Single crystals of the CeNi1-xCoxGe2 series for x  0 01 02 03 have already been grown inset Fig 1b at the University of Maryland and preliminary measurements of the magnetic structure of the parent compound have been determined via neutron diffraction Fig 1c and a field- and temperature-dependent phase diagram was constructed shown in the bottom panel  These results show an intense competition between two incommensurate orders as a function of field and temperature leading to a multiple-Q magnetic order Differences in their field and temperature dependences however opens the question To what extent are their stabilization mechanisms cooperative Additionally does the 2D nature of its magnetic correlations and transport properties play a role As doping influences the electronic structure and can have a direct effect on the spin texture formation  - eg via Fermi surface nesting or multi-spin interactions - as a first step we propose to study its effect on spin textures in CeNi1-xCoxGe2 to help clarify what drives the complex interplay of the order parameters 2 Proposed experiment An important initial step is to analyze changes in the magnetic structure with chemical doping toward the critical concentration We will perform diffraction measurements for CeNi1-xCoxGe2 single crystals m  01 g of two compositions x  01 02 where TN  2 1 K respectively to track the magnetic Bragg peaks as a function of field and temperature Thus the measurements will require the He3 system Since in the parent compound the moments lie along the c-axis and are modulated along a measurements also will be performed in the h k 0 scattering plane At base temperature we will measure along h 1  to identify the location of any magnetic satellite peaks at 1h 1  followed by measurements along h k  to check any tilting of the propagation vector away from the a-axis Once the locations of magnetic reflections are identified field dependence will be carried out at base temperature Then we will measure the temperature dependence of the reflections 3 Beamtime request The triple-axis instrument BT-7 is ideal for the measurements due to its high flux resolution flexibility and ability to handle the large He3 cryostat Samples will be precooled before loading into the beam We will measure magnetic reflections at base temperature and their field dependence requiring an estimated 2 days per sample Temperature dependence in zero magnetic field will follow requiring 1 day per sample Thus our request is for 6 days on the BT-7 triple-axis spectrometer References 1 P Coleman Handbook of Magnetism and Advanced Magnetic Materials 2007 2 S-Z Lin and S Hayami Phys Rev B 93 2016 3 C D Batista S Z Lin S Hayami and Y Kamiya Rep Prog Phys 79 084504 2016 4 Y Hirose et al J Phys Soc of Jpn 80 2011 5 B K Lee et al Phys Rev B 71 214433 2005 6 L Poudel and JW Lynn private communication 7 H Im T Ito J Hong S-i Kimura and Y Kwon Phys Rev B 72 220405 2005 07 08 09 10 11 12 1310-110010110210310410508 10 12020040060080008 10 12-20020406080100120140Counts 10 SecsH in H 1  T  15 KT  5 KK in 082 K  K in 077 K  a bcFig 1 a Phase diagram of CeNi1-xCoxGe2 determined in Ref  where the composition-tuned quantum critical point occurs at a critical concentration xc  03 b Susceptibility measurements showing strong easy axis anisotropy along the c-axis Fits of the Curie-Weiss law c  CT -
