 Magnetic Excitation of the Quasi-1D Quantum Antiferromagnet Cu2MoO4SeO3 Scientific Background Nonreciprocal propagation of particleswaves is of growing interest not only because of the fundamental condensed matter physics viewpoint but also from technical applications for instance the optical isolator is based on the nonreciprocal propagation of lights in a certain class of materials whereas semiconductor diode is a classical device to rectify electric current using noncentrosymmetric p-n junction Nonreciprocal propagation of magnon spin waves is of growing interest since it may be used as the unidirectional filter for the GHz radiowaves as well as spin-current diode necessary for spintronics devices realization In our previous study on a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet a-Cu2V2O7 we observed magnon band splitting due to the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya DM interactions between nearest neighbors Cu atoms which becomes active because of noncentrosymmetry  This band splitting results in the nonreciprocal propagation of magnon polarization and can be regarded as the first confirmation of magnon birefringence effect which is an analogues effect of optical birefringencerotation To establish universality of the effect and to elucidate its microscopic origin other materials exhibiting similar effect are highly demanded Preliminary Research on Proposed Material For the above reason we have searched for another possible 1D spin chain compound and found Cu2MoO4SeO3 as a candidate Cu2MoO4SeO3 crystallizes in a monoclinic system and belongs to the space group P21c with b  10467 a  81485 b  90235 c  83925 Fig1 a  The unit cell contains an armchair-like chains formed by Cu1 and Cu2 ions with alternate bond lengths 3186 A 2973 A and 3149 A along the crystallographic c-axis Fig1 b Though the space group is centrosymmetric locally it does not possess the inversion symmetry between the shortest Cu-Cu bond and allows the presence of local DM interaction Fig1 a Unit cell of Cu2MoO4SeO3 shows the chain formed by Cu1 and Cu2 ions along c-axis b inequivalent exchange path in the chain the local lacking of inversion symmetry between the shortest bond allows the presence of DM interaction We have performed a preliminary magnetic susceptibility measurement under the magnetic field 1 kOe and 10 kOe to characterize this compound Fig2 The magnetic susceptibility under 1 kOe shows a broad peak near 50 K which can be well fitted to the well-known Bonner-Fisher curve shown by the soild line indicating one-dimensional antiferromagnetic nature of this compound Two transition temperatures were observed at TN2  12 K and TN2  22 K both in the zero-field cooling ZFC and field cooling FC runs The huge irreversibility at TN2 for the ZFC and FC runs further indicates that the transition at TN2 is accompanied by the appearance of weak ferromagnetic moment in addition to the dominant antiferromagnetic order This suggests that the DM interaction is indeed deterministic for the magnetic ordering in this compound The inverse susceptibility was fit between 175 K  T  300 K to the Curie-Weiss law and the Curie-Weiss temperature   -5385 K was obtained The negative Curie-Weiss temperature therefore confirms that the dominant exchange interaction between Cu2 ions in Cu2MoO4SeO3 is antiferromagnetic Assuming that the structure of Cu2MoO4SeO3 is 1D the calculated value of intrachain coupling is JkB  1081 K whereas the Bonner-Fisher fit gives slightly smaller value JkB  6992 K Although its magnetic structure is yet to be known we believe that it is collinear type antiferromagnetic order with weak ferromagnetism induced by the DM interaction We have already secured a beam time for neutron powder diffraction to determine the magnetic structure We have also been working on low-temperature structure analysis using our lab-based single crystal x-ray diffraction The single crystals of this material have been just recently obtained in our lab Fig 3 since this material can only be grown by the hydrothermal method the crystals are relatively small 1 mm3 However since we can get a number of crystals at once by the hydrothermal method and the crystal axes can be clearly seen from their facet we believe we can co-align 100 to 1000 crystals easily to do single crystal neutron inelastic scattering By knowing the availability of single crystals here we would like to propose the study on the magnetic excitation on this material Fig2 Magnetic susceptibility of Cu2MoO4SeO3 measured under 10 kOe reveals the broad maximum near T  50K The solid line is a fit to the Bonner-Fisher model The inset shows the transition temperatures at low temperature magnetic susceptibility measured under 1 kOe for field cooling blue and zero field cooling red runs Experimental Details and Estimation of Beamtime The experiment will be typical single-crystal inelastic experiment at the direct geometry chopper spectrometer The co-aligned crystals are aligned c-axis perpendicular to the incident neutron beam ki this utilize the one-dimensionality of the magnetic system at most ie we do not have to rotate sample We would like to measure two temperatures T  base temperature  4K and paramagnetic temperature 25 K The first temperature is selected since our main purpose is to see the magnon dispersion shift whereas the other temperature is for searching putative not yet confirmed spinon dispersion shift We would like to use two Ei Ei  10meV and Ei  5 meV the first one is for obtaining overall spectra whereas the latter one is for obtaining detailed information in the low-energy range where most important information should be seen In view of small moment size s12 we expect one day may be necessary for each scan and hence including sample setup and other exploratory scans we would like to ask 5 days beamtime at DCS References  G Gitgeatpong Y Zhao P Piyawongwatthana Y Qiu L W Harriger N P Butch T J Sato and K
