and Technology Trondheim Norway Scientific Importance Ion transport across nanoscale interfaces is an increasingly viable route towards the electric-field control of magnetism in thin film devices  Perovskite oxides show particular promise for these so-called magneto-ionic technologies because strong entanglement of their spin orbit and lattice degrees of freedom can lead to large magnetic responses with small changes in ion chemistry In addition oxygen vacancies often form ordered structures in perovskites eg Brownmillerites  which leads to fast ionic diffusion pathways switch rates in the MHz range and topotactic phase changes that extend throughout films 10-100 nanometers thick  Reversible voltage-control of magneto-ionics has been demonstrated for several functional magnetic properties including Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy However much of this work has occurred in systems operating well away from room temperature Presently the absence of magneto-ionic oxides that operate at or near room temperature presents a significant bottleneck to the fields advancement Preliminary Work From preliminary magnetometry experiments we believe we have found a room temperature magneto-ionic in the perovskite LaFeO3 LFO The parent compound exhibits G-type antiferromagnetism AFM with a Nel temperature of 740 K owing to a large Fe3-O-Fe3 superexchange interaction  However if we imagine removing oxygen ions from LFO the system must compensate to maintain charge neutrality One possible compensation mechanism is the reduction of Fe ions adjacent to oxygen vacancies to a Fe2 valance state Removal of enough oxygen ions would then tip the system towards a Fe3-O-Fe2 arrangement and favor double exchange ferromagnetism FM analogous to the behavior of the mixed valence manganites  If the process is reversible we then have a magneto-ionic that can be switched between FM and AFM states which could have tremendous technological potential including in non-volatile magnetic memory To test our hypothesis that the reduction of LFO can generate FM we grew a series of LFO films and deposited different metal overlayers known for gettering oxygen Preliminary magnetometry results from a 10 nm Ta film deposited on a 15 nm LFO film are shown in Fig 1 compared against an as-grown LFO film As expected the parent has no hysteresis or coercivity On the other hand the TaLFO bilayer shows clear hysteresis that persists at least to room temperature This FM-like behavior has been replicated with multiple metal-capped samples and shows clear differences in magnetization when different metals or deposition procedures are used strong Figure 1 SQUID magnetometry comparing the in-plane moment of as-grown bare LFO and reduced Ta-capped LFO samples Inset highlights area near zero field and absence of hysteresis in the as-grown sample Note diamagnetic contribution from substrate has not been subtracted indications that this behavior is intrinsic to the metalLFO system and not the result of extrinsic contamination Experimental Plan To verify this finding and elucidate its origin we are approaching the problem from a number of angles X-ray absorption measurements are planned to look directly for signatures of changing Fe valence A TaLFO thickness ratio tr series has been grown and magnetometry measurements are in progress to see whether the saturated moment or other magnetic properties scale with this simple proxy for LFO reduction Here we propose polarized neutron reflectometry PNR measurements for three reasons that provide complimentary information to these other approaches 1 The depth-resolved magnetization profile from PNR can unambiguously verify that it is the LFO and not some extrinsic surface contamination that is responsible for the FM-signal and hysteresis we observe in magnetometry 2 Our working hypothesis is that the Ta overlayer acts as an oxygen sink gettering oxygen from the LFO film Since Ta metal and Ta2O5 have distinctly different scattering length densities 383x10-6 A-2 and 479x10-6 A-2 respectively a difference of more than 20 the nuclear depth profile will allow us to comment on whether the Ta layer is in fact oxidizing as we expect 3 Lastly the choice and preparation of oxide substrates is well known to impact the extent of oxygen defects in films grown on top  By looking at a series of films with similar TaLFO thickness ratios but different substrates or substrate preparations we can begin to determine what role the substrate plays the oxidation state and magnetism of our LFO films Measurement Details For this experiment we request use of the Polarized Beam Reflectometer at NCNR a standard 4-325K closed-cycle displex and the low-field 07 T electromagnet Our sample series consists of five samples grown using pulsed laser deposition by two different groups G1  Takeuchi Group UMD and G2  Tybell Group NTNU 1 G1 TaLFOLSAT TaLFO tr  051 2 G1 TaLFOSTO TaLFO tr  051 3 G2 TaLFOSTO TaLFO tr  047 solvent substrate clean 4 G2 TaLFOSTO TaLFO tr  047 solvent  DI substrate clean 5 G2 TaLFOSTO TaLFO tr  047 solvent DI  anneal substrate clean All five samples have been grown and extensively pre-characterized X-ray diffraction patterns in Fig 2 show that the films are epitaxially aligned to their substrates and Laue oscillations reveal smooth film surfaces Atomic force micrographs for the G2 series show sharply terraced surfaces and the effect of annealing on step-edge spacing For our experiment at NCNR non-spin flip PNR measurements would be collected first at room temperature under a saturating 05 T in-plane field Then the sample would be field cooled to 5 or 10 K where the saturated state would be remeasured Next the field would be dropped to near remnance 5 mT true remnance not possible with PNR and PNR measured Finally the sample would be warmed back to 300 K at remnance and PNR measured a fourth and final time This procedure allows us to determine whether hysteresis is present at base temperature where magnetism is strongest and also room temperature where we would prefer to operate a magneto-ionic device Measurements under saturating fields help determine the full moment in the LFO on various substrates and highlight any interfacial effects Lastly starting and ending with room temperature scans will help expedite sample changeover and minimize downtime during the run This plan thus consists of twenty reflectivity scans four scans on five samples From previous experience with this instrument we expect each reflectivity scan to take 8 hrs or 15 day per sample when you include cooling and warming time With these considerations in mind we request 8 days of beamtime to collect our proposed measurements References 1 C Leighton Nat
