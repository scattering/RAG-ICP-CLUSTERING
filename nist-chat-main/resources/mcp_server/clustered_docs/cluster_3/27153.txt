Possible orbital magnetism in a cuprate CuGa2O4 The spin-orbit interaction has recently attracted great attention for the intriguing magnetic states that can result from it Due to the strong spin-orbit interaction in 5d oxide the studies of unconventional spin-orbit magnetism were initially focused on iridates such as possible Kitaev spin-liquid states in Na2IrO3  and unconventional spiral order in Li2IrO3  Recent studies have demonstrated that strong spin-orbit coupling can also be achieved in 4d materials such as RuCl3  Now there is the fascinating possibility that Cu2 the iconic spin-12 ion well known from cuprate superconductors could exhibit an orbital moment when sitting in the tetrahedral A site of the spinel compound AB2O4 with B  Al Ga  A-site spinels are of course well-known for their interesting magnetic properties resulting from magnetic frustration  If Cu sits on the A site the spinel structure would cause its single 3d hole to be shared among the Cu dxy dxz and dyz orbitals which would cause a substantial orbital contribution to the magnetic moment A model of isotropic magnetic exchange leads to a prediction of a novel spiral spin-liquid state  while inclusion of the anisotropic coupling resulting from spin-orbit effects leads to a particular spiral order  Even in the case of site disorder unconventional spin correlations can result  Neutron scattering is the ideal technique for distinguishing these possibilities Recent thermodynamic studies of CuAl2O4 suggest that the Cu moment corresponds to Jeff  12  At the same time magnetization studies of CuAl2O4 and CuGa2O4 have found evidence for a spin-glass transition at  2 K 91 The BNL group has now grown a large over 5g high-quality single crystal of CuGa2O4 by the floating-zone method Based on our preliminary results DC susceptibility measurements show no sign of any transition to magnetic order or spin glass down to 17 K The linear fit of 1M vs T gives a Curie-Weiss temperature of -76 K as shown in Fig1 X-ray powder diffraction measurement shows this crystal has the spinel crystal structure which agrees with the previous report 1 In previous experiments we found no long-range magnetic ordering in this sample down to 01 K We also found special low energy magnetic excitations in the spinel compound as shown in Fig 2 The ring-shaped magnetic excitations appear around 200 at low temperature and the intensities of magnetic excitations gradually disappear at Fig1 DC susceptibility measurement of temperature dependence of inverse M Measured at 100Oe temperature above 100K So we make a difference of 01k minus 100K data to show the magnetic excitations clearly in Fig 2 The magnetic excitations have almost same q-dependence in all energy we measured 05 to 10 meV and show no clear dispersion We propose to carry out inelastic neutron scattering measurements to probe the magnetic excitations in CuGa2O4 The measurements will focus on magnetic excitations in this compound with energy higher than the previous MACS measurements and if possible to map out the entire band of the magnetic excitation We will also measure the temperature dependence of magnetic excitations in this sample which will help us identify the role of anisotropic exchange interactions in this spinel compound and may demonstrate the predicted novel strong spin-orbit coupling states in 3d Oxides The thermal neutron spectrometer BT7 is the most suitable instrument to perform these measurements because we need high intensity in a limited range of reciprocal space The single crystal growths favor a single domain which makes the situation much less complicated We would run our experiments in the HK0 plane Our current estimate would be that for base temperature it would take about 3 days to map out the spin excitations And we would like to get at least 3 temperatures 3K 15K and 100K To be able to finish the measurements we will be asking for 7 days total beam time on BT7 References  J Chaloupka et al Phys Rev Lett105 027204 2010  A Biffin et al Phys Rev Lett113 197201 2014  A Banerjee et al Science 356 1055 2017 a b Fig2 Inelastic neutron scattering measurements of contour intensity maps of low-energy magnetic excitations in HK0 plane at 01K and subtract 100K data as background at a 1 meV and b 4 meV  S A Nikolaev et al Phys Rev B 98 201106R 2018  N Tristan et al PhysRevB72 174404 2005  D Bergman et al Nat Phys 3 487 2007  M Iakovleva et al Phys Rev B 91 144419 2015  C H Kim et al arXiv181008594  R Nirmala et al J Phys Condens Matter 29 13LT01 2017 1 G A Petrakovskii et al Phys Rev B 63 184425 2001
