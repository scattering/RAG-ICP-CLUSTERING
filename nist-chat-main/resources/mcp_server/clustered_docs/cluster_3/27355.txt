 Study of the Postulated Griffiths Phase in the Mixed Rare Earth Dialuminides PrErAl2 Rare-earth intermetallics play a critical yet often obscure role in numerous technological applications including sensors actuators permanent magnets and rechargeable batteries therefore understanding their basic science is of utmost importance Rare earth dialuminides containing mixed light R and heavy R lanthanides R1xRxAl2 create an interesting playground with spin-orbit coupling constants opposite for the light and heavy lanthanides and more generally a competition between R and R leads to anomalous behavior Our recent magnetic measurements show that the compounds PrErAl2 show complex magnetization behaviors including metamagnetic transitions and a Griffiths-like phase None of the dialuminides formed by the individual pure lanthanides have been reported to possess such a peculiar magnetic phase transformation In this proposal we seek to investigate the precise nature of the magnetic structures of PrErAl2 in the Griffiths phase at zero and finite external magnetic fields using polarized SANS measurements Background and Scientific Motivation Rare earth dialuminides reveal interesting physics such as strong crystal field CF effects due to anisotropic 4f charge density as well as the competition between different magnetic and crystal structures Pure binary rare earth dialuminides have been extensively studied and shown to exhibit the magnetocaloric effect leading to a suggestion about possible applications as low temperature magnetic refrigerants 1- However the physical behavior of compounds containing mixed light R and heavy R lanthanides which may involve potentially interesting physics have been barely examined As the geometry of 4f charge densities is different ie prolate vs oblate spheroids as well as the sign of the spin-orbit interaction R1xRxAl2 create an interesting playground with randomly varying crystal-field anisotropies Starting from the binary PrAl2 and ErAl2 compounds a systematic investigation of the crystallographic physical and electronic properties in the PrErAl2 system has been carried out by our collaborators 1 4- The composition Pr06Er04Al2 turns out to be particularly interesting as it shows unique properties among this series The binary PrAl2 and ErAl2 exhibit ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transitions at 325 K and 14 K respectively However our recent magnetic and neutron diffraction measurements  show that with the substitution of Pr by Er in PrAl2 PrErAl2 undergoes a paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic FIM transition at TC  24 K inset b of Fig 2 In the FIM phase the Pr and Er moments are aligned antiparallel Specific heat measurements revealed the existence of a peak due to the FIM transition at low magnetic fields but the existence of an additional sharp peak at  12 K at high fields suggesting that Pr06Er04Al2 undergoes a further phase transition under those conditions Furthermore in a magnetic field of only 1 kOe a sharp downturn in the inverse dc magnetic susceptibility c-1 is observed see inset a Fig 1 at a characteristic temperature TG  26 K signalling the onset of a Griffith-like phase which is characterized by short range FIM clustering due to competing interactions and anisotropies involving the Pr and Er atoms in Pr06Er04Al2  Fig 1 The inverse dc magnetic susceptibility c-1 as a function of temperature at an external magnetic field up to 70 kOe The inset a shows details low temperature c-1 behaviour The inset b shows magnetization as a function of temperature at H1 kOe Thus this compound possesses unusual physical properties including a large exchange bias ferrimagnetic state Griffiths phase and first-order magnetic field induced transitions 4  Goals and Scope of the Proposal We have started studying the nature of the Griffiths phase using SANS on the NG7 beamline to look for the existence of magnetic clusters above the ferrimagnetic ordering temperature Tc The Griffiths phase  in a system with quenched-in disorder is a phase which exists at temperatures above the true long-range ordering temperature where quantities such as the magnetization free energy etc are non-analytic functions of magnetic field and temperature It is characterized by local clusters of ordered spins presumably ferrimagnetic clusters in this case up to a temperature TG Fig 2 shows the SANS data taken at NG7 at 25 K on a single crystal of Pr06Er04Al2 just above Tc in zero magnetic field with the high temperature data which is purely nuclear scattering subtracted as background which shows an unsaturated power law of intensity with respect to q implying the existence of large fractal clusters whose size is beyond the capability of the instrument to determine The application of fields of 1 KOe and 2KOe strongly suppressed the scattering indicating it was of magnetic origin  Fig2 SANS data in a log-log plot taken on NG7 from the Pr06Er04Al2 crystal at 25 K with an unpolarized beam in zero magnetic field with the scattering in the paramagnetic phase at 75 K subtracted off Scattering plotted is along the 00 direction of the crystal Proposed Experiments and Instrumentation The single crystal has dimensions of about 20 mm diameter and we would like to carry out polarized SANS measurements on the VSANS instrument to be able to reach smaller q-values and hopefully determine the cluster sizes We will again measure the SANS with an unpolarized beam at temperatures well above TG and TC in order to determine the nuclear small angle scattering The superimposed weak paramagnetic scattering from the rare earth ions will be almost constant over the q-range of interest We will then measure with polarized neutrons the temperature dependent magnetic SANS intensity at different magnetic fields at Q range from 00005 -1 to 05 -1 which is within the instruments accessible Q-range of 00002  -1 to 10 -1 The neutron spectra will be collected in the temperature range 18-300 K and in magnetic fields up to 5 kOe These measurements will allow us to identify the size and nature of the magnetic clusters polarized parallel to the direction of applied magnetic field and the neutron spin  Hence the SANS measurements will help us to verify the existence of a Griffiths-like phase in the form of a FIM cluster within a PM matrix We are requesting 5 days of polarized neutron beamtime at the VSANS Beamline at NIST References  A K Pathak Y Mudryk K A Gschneidner and V K Pecharsky Phys Rev Lett 110 186405 2013  F W Wang X X Zhang and F X Hu Appl Phys
