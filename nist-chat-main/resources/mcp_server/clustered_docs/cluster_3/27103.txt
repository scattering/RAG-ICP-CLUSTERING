Field dependence of the spin excitations in a quasi one-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg magnet Scientific background Recently topological quantum phase transition was identified in the Ising-like antiferromagnetic spin chain BaCo2V2O8 in the transverse magnetic field  It has surprisingly been found that two dual topological excitations compete to control the phase diagram and the transition in BaCo2V2O8 while the transitions are controlled by only one type of topological excitations in most cases The modification of the spin excitations was observed beyond the critical magnetic field in the inelastic neutron scattering INS experiment and the agreement with numerical calculations confirmed the topological nature of the transition SrCo2V2O8 is a promising candidate to share the similar properties with BaCo2V2O8 In both materials screw chains of Co2 rotate around the four-fold c axis with effective spin S  12 1  Besides the weak interchain coupling leads to long-range magnetic order below the critical temperature TN  55 K for BaCo2V2O8 and TN  52 K for SrCo2V2O8 in both cases 1  The previous high field optical measurement has revealed quantum phase transition from 3D antiferromagnetic phase to 1D disorder phase with the critical field of 7 T in SrCo2V2O8  More interestingly two quantum critical points occurred at 7 T and 77 T respectively have been resolved in the NMR measurement recently  These results revealed an enriched phase diagram induced by the transverse field that is worth further investigation Magnetic susceptibility measurement on our powder sample down to 2 K is shown in Fig1 The AFM phase transition that occurred at 5 K is consistent with the previous measurements  We have successfully grown large single crystal samples of SrCo2V2O8 using the floating zone method The X-ray diffraction measurement revealed clear patterns in our single crystals Fig 2 indicating their high quality We have already performed INS experiment on DCS under transverse field at 4 T and 10 T respectively Fig 3 However the field dependence of the spin excitations below and above the critical field is still elusive Therefore the primary goal of this experiment is to study the field dependence of the spin excitations of SrCo2V2O8 to identify the quantum phase transition in this compound To elucidate the evolution of spin excitations in the transverse field would provide insight for the dynamic structure factor calculations and may reveal the possible topological origin of the quantum phase transition in SrCo2V2O8 Proposed experiment We will align 5 grams of SrCo2V2O8 single crystals in the H0L plane for this experiment First we would cool down to 2 K and apply a magnetic field H  8 T along b axis We would perform horace scans to map out the spin excitations at 8 T In addition we will lower the magnetic field to 6 T and 2 T and repeat those scans to study the field dependence of the spin excitation spectrum DCS is ideal for this experiment for its high flux suitable energy scales and proper sample environment For this experiment we request 7 days beamtime on DCS References  Q Faure et al Nat Phys 14 716-722 2018  Z Wang et al Nature 554 219-223 2018  A K Bera et al Phys Rev B 89 094402 2014  Z Wang et al Phys Rev B 94 125130 2016  Y Cui et al Phys Rev Lett 123 067203 2019 Fig 1 The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility in external field H  1 T Inset shows the enlarged view of the susceptibility curve in the vicinity of TN Fig 2 X-ray diffraction pattern of SrCo2V2O8 single crystal samples grown by floating zone method the inset shows the rocking scan of 004 Bragg peak Fig 3 Dispersions of the spin excitations along chain direction of SrCo2V2O8 under transverse field H  10 T The data was integrated over H  15 25 rlu
