Magnetic structure of double perovskite iridate La2NiIrO6 Scientific Background Magnetism arising from strong spin-orbit coupling is an interesting topic of relevance in many 4d5d transition metal compounds such as iridates 1- Understanding the differencesimilarity between the magnetic behavior of 5d systems and the better understood 3d magnetism is important for developing potential applications of these novel magnetic systems Ordered double perovskite DP materials A2BBO6 provide a rare opportunity to study how magnetism is translated between 3d transition metal B and 4d5d transition metal B Some of these materials such as Sr2FeMoO6 have been extensively studied for potential applications in spintronics  Recent experimental studies on DP iridates have revealed many interesting magnetic properties For example inelastic neutron scattering on La2ZnIrO6 indicated a local spin nature of the Ir moments from delocalized 5d electrons  Complimentary studies on La2CoIrO6 LCIO using XAS and XMCD confirmed a strong hybridization between 3d Co and 5d Ir  Our preliminary RIXS data on LCIO and La2NiIrO6 LNIO at Ir L3 edge showed clear magnetic excitations with a large magnon gap 40 meV indicating an extremely large magnetic anisotropy in their magnetic interaction To better understand these novel magnetic properties in DP iridates the basic information about their magnetic structures is indispensable DFT calculations predicted similar canted antiferromagnetic AFM ground states for both LCIO and LNIO 8 However the magnetization data of them show a significant difference The molar magnetic susceptibility of LNIO is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of LCIO The distinct magnetic properties between LNIO and LCIO are not understood yet since both compounds adopt a similar monoclinic structure Previous neutron powder diffraction XMCD measurements have already confirmed the canted AFM ground state for LCIO 8101 in which the Co2 spins and Ir4 pseudospins couple antiferromagnetically and an overall ferrimagnetism is displayed In contrast there are no available microscopic probes including neutron diffraction or element-specific x-ray scattering performed on LNIO so far to conclude its magnetic ground state Here we propose to study the magnetic structure of LNIO using neutron powder diffraction Preliminary work Previously we have performed resonant inelastic x-ray scattering RIXS measurement on a single-crystal sample of La2NiIrO6 at the Ir L3 edge which showed clear magnetic excitations with a large magnon gap 40 meV indicating an extremely large magnetic anisotropy in the underlying magnetic interaction However the existence of multiple monoclinic twins in the crystals make the study of magnetic order in this compound using either single-crystal neutron diffraction or resonant magnetic x-ray scattering technique very difficult Recently we have synthesized the polycrystalline sample of La2NiIrO6 7 g using solid-state reaction method The sample was confirmed to be of single phase according to the x-ray diffraction pattern Fig 1 The disorder of NiIr mixing was estimated to be 5 We have also characterized the polycrystalline sample of La2NiIrO6 by performing magnetic susceptibility measurement which shows multiple magnetic phase transitions as shown in Fig 2 However the nature of these magnetic phase transitions needs to be figured out Experimental plan The aim of this proposal is to unambiguously determine the ground-state magnetic structure of La2NiIrO6 and to figure out the nature of multiple magnetic transitions appearing in its magnetic susceptibility using neutron powder diffraction We propose to perform neutron powder diffraction measurements on high-quality crystalline La2NiIrO6 samples  7 g at the high-resolution powder diffractometer BT-1 with the neutron wavelength   1197  to reduce the neutron absorption effect of the Ir element An annular thin-walled vanadium container will be used as the sample holder for our polycrystalline sample for which the absorption of neutrons by Ir can be reduced significantly This will make the powder diffraction measurements on Ir-contained compounds feasible 8 10 1 Since there are three characteristic temperatures for LNIO at T1  42 K T2  65 K and T3 80 K as shown in Fig 2 the neutron diffraction patterns will be collected at a set of Fig 1 XRD diffraction pattern of polycrystalline LNIO collected at the room temperature Fig 2 Magnetic susceptibility of polycrystalline LNIO measured under zero-field cooling ZFC and field cooling FC processes respectively temperatures including 4 K 10 K 20 K 30 K 40 K 50 K 60 K 70 K 80 K 90 K and 100 K respectively to figure out the change of its magnetic structure with increasing temperature Considering possible necessities of long-time counting at each temperature due to the neutron absorption effect we request 2 days of beamtime at BT-1 4 hours for each temperature for the proposed experiment References  B J Kim et al Phys Rev Lett 101 076402 2008  B J Kim et al Science 323 1329 2009  D Pesin et al Nat Phys 6 376 2010  X Wan et al Phys Rev B 83
