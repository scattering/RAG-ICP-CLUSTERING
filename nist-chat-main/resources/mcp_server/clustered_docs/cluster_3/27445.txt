Probing the magnetic rotation in magnetostrictive Co1-xTbx on PMN-PT01 as a function of voltage Michelle E Jamer1 and Luqiao Liu2 1 Physics Department United States Naval Academy Annapolis MD 2Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge MA Introduction Strain coupled multiferroics are currently being pursued due to their enhanced tunability towards room temperature applications  The artificial systems are proposed to replace intrinsic single-phase multiferroics since they can be optimized for the proposed system via magnetoelectric coupling Information storage needs are dramatically increasing and require sub 10 nm magnetic feature sizes and lower energy writing  Traditional magnetic memory write systems are plagued by large current densities for switching the magnetization which causes the magnetic size for information storage to stay above this 10 nm magnetic feature ideal  By switching magnetic states with an electric field instead of a magnetic field low power writing can become a reality via using strain to couple the magnetic and electric properties while supporting a lower current density thereby allowing for the magnetic feature storage size to decrease to 10 nm  In these systems a magnetostrictivemagnetoelastic thin film is grown on a piezoelectric substrate to artificially produce desirable multiferroic properties including a resultant change in magnetization with applied voltage  These predicted systems are expected to only use a few attoJoules of energy which would be beneficial for high-performance magnetic memory  While these artificial multiferroics are gaining interest in the ferromagnetic regime there is much to be explored with an antiferromagnetic or compensated ferrimagnetic material deposited on a piezoelectric substrate Antiferromagnetic multiferroics are attractive for spintronic applications since there is no external magnetic moment to interfere with surrounding components Currently BiFeO3 is the best material candidate single phase multiferroic for devices however there are problems with its inconsistent growth mechanisms and domain formation after a voltage is applied thereby causing inconsistent behavior with large scale production  Co1-xTbx is a rare earth - transition metal ferrimagnetic alloy that have already have shown promise as a candidate for antiferromagnetic spintronics In this alloy there is an exchange interactions between the magnetic moments from the d-orbitals of the transition metal and the f-orbitals of the rare earth component There is a compensation point where x  022 where there is a low net magnetic moment which would be beneficial in various devices This compensated ferrimagnet is a promising candidate for an artificial multiferroic device where the magnetization can change via applying a voltage through a piezoelectric Co1-xTbx also exhibited some perpendicular magnetic anisotropy PMA which could be further used to help spin-switching efficiency Traditionally proposed devices with PMA are desirable since they have a larger density than those with solely in-plane memory bits By using a material with PMA we can further increase the Figure 1 Sample architecture on PMN-PT density needed to drastically improve the current technology This material is extremely magnetostrictive which causes the magnetization to rotate with an applied strain which will lead to a demonstratively sized change in the magnetization with applied electric field Preliminary Measurements Thin films were grown on both Silicon and PMN-PT substrates and preliminary measurements have determined these thin films have some magnetic anisotropy and have a large magnetostrictive constant  The extrapolated data from Figure 2 indicates that the magnetostriction is over 400 parts per million ppm based on estimates of the Youngs modulus of the compound For comparison galfenols magnetostrction is around 400 ppm for an ideal thin film These samples indicate that there is a large moment rotation between the stress on the piezoelectric and the compound The PMN-PT samples have a 20 nm layer of the Co1-xTbx x019 022 026 alloy which is sandwiched between two layers of Pt shown in Figure 1 These samples are available The baseline magnetic properties of this compound are shown in Figure 3 Here we see the in-plane IP and out-of-plane OP properties of the material Here we see there is a strong magnetic anisotropy and the in-plane magnetization has a coactivity close to 5 Oe The out-of-plane hysteresis loop is very interesting since there is a two-step behavior However with reflectometry we can only directly probe the in-plane magnetization -2x10-5-1x10-501x10-52x10-5-10000 -5000 0 5000 10000OPIPH Oem emuFigure 2 Magnetostriction Measurements Figure 3 Magnetic Measurements using SQUID Magnetometry Neutron Experiment For this experiment 4 days of time on MAGIK are requested We believe that we would be able to observe the rotation of the magnetization vector as a function of applied voltage These voltage-dependent measurementswill allow us to understand the magnetostrictive coupling between the magnetostrictive material and the PMN-PT substrate For our PNR measurement we plan to characterize each of the three samples with different compositions in four conditions 1 in a saturating field 2 in remanence 3 with application of 200 V and 4 with application of 400 V Each measurement requires approximately 6-10 hours of beamtime since we will measure all four polarization cross sections We thus request a total of 4 days of PNR beam time By using polarized neutron reflectometry only the magnetization parallel to the applied field can fully be understood however the spin-flip data will enable us to measure the vector rotation  J Ma J Hu Z Li and C-W Nan Recent Progress in Multiferroic Magnetoelectric Composites from Bulk to Thin Films Adv Mater vol 23 no 9 pp 1062-1087 2011  S Yuasa T Nagahama A Fukushima Y Suzuki and K Ando Giant room-temperature magnetoresistance in single-crystal FeMgOFe magnetic tunnel junctions Nature Materials vol 3 p 868 31 10 2004  M Gajek J J Nowak J Z Sun P L Trouilloud E J OSullivan D W Abraham M C Gaidis G Hu S Brown Y Zhu R P Robertazzi W J Gallagher and D C Worledge Spin torque switching of 20 nm magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular anisotropy Applied Physics Letters 2012  J-M Hu Z Li L-Q Chen and C-W Nan High-density magnetoresistive random access memory operating at ultralow voltage at room temperature Nature Communications vol 2 p 553 22 11 2011    C R Rementer K Fitzell Q Xu P Nordeen G P Carman Y E Wang and J P Chang Tuning static and dynamic properties of FeGaNiFe heterostructures Appl Phys Lett vol 110 no 24 p 242403 2017 Michelle E Jamer Colin R Rementer Anthony Barra Alexander J Grutter Kevin Fitzell Daniel B Gopman Julie A Borchers Gregory P Carman Brian J Kirby and Jane P Chang Long-Range Electric Field Control of Permalloy Layers in Strain-Coupled Composite Multiferroics Phys Rev Applied 10 044045 2018 J Finley and L Liu Spin-Orbit-Torque Efficiency in Compensated Ferrimagnetic Cobalt-Terbium Alloys Physical Review Applied 6 054001 2016
