 Page 1 of 2 Neutron scattering study on the temperature-dependence of phonon spectra of two-dimensional metal chalcogenide Scientific background Two dimensional 2D metal chalcogenides are constituted by covalentlyionically bonded atomic layers that are held together via interlayer van der Waals vdW forces The hierarchic bonding and anisotropic crystal structures bring about interesting anomaly in electrical optical and thermal properties 1  Due to the intrinsically weak vdW interactions these materials can be readily processed into ultrathin samples The unique physical properties and the intrinsically 2D geometry together make them promising candidate in the next-generation electronic devices for energy conversion and information communication 3  Indium selenide InSe the layered III-VI compound is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap around 13 eV at room temperature  and adopts a hexagonal or trigonal crystal structure in which Se-In-In-Se four-atom layers are periodically stacked along c-axis via the cross layer interactions  Previously it exhibits a high mobility 1000 cm2Vs for monolayer strong optical response and low thermal conductivity  therefore InSe was suggested to be applied as transistors optoelectronics and thermoelectrics In addition the unique elastic properties such as the negative thermal expansion  were obtained recently The physical and mechanical properties of InSe are fundamentally related to the features of chemical bonding and lattice vibration the ionic In-Se bond the covalent In-In bond and interlayer vdW interactions The atomic vibrationbonding characters and the microscopic physical properties can be bridged by the dispersion properties of phonons However previous studies on this issue were conducted mostly via first principle calculations or Raman scattering which cannot provide a straightforward and vivid picture of phonon dispersion In this proposal we want to use inelastic neutron scattering technique to obtain the phonon dispersion spectra of InSe Combining first-principle calculation the behaviors of phonons will be correlated to the various chemical bonding Based on the understanding of the lattice dynamics and structural mechanisms we could explain and regulate the thermal thermoelastic and transport properties of InSe Preliminary results We have successfully synthesized InSe single-crystal at Shanghai Jiao Tong University The anisotropy thermal conductivity has been obtained in Fig 2 In addition the longitudinal phonon dispersions along H0 have been measured at 200K Aims of the proposed experiment We propose to use the thermal triple-axis spectrometer BT-7 to measure the phonon spectra of InSe at different temperatures Based on the first-principle calculation  and previous measurement at MAPS ISIS the acoustic phonon energy is low with a cutoff at 8 meV and optical phonon could reach  28meV Therefore BT-7 spectrometer is ideally suited for this experiment The sample will be aligned in HHL plane Based on previous measurement the temperature dependence of the phonon dispersions would be measured along HH 00 and HH in the zones of 440 004 The final neutron energy will be fixed at 137 meV The collimations of 50-50- Page 2 of 2 50-120 achieve an energy resolution E10meV which is suitable to measure the dispersion in this material Since the transition temperature is around 120K the regular CCR will fit the experiment well Figure 3 presented the phonon simulations the LA-TA exclusion could be expressed by the red arrow beside the M-point Moreover the optical phonon related to the interlayer interaction has been obtained in previous time-of-flight tof measurement Therefore it is very interesting to measure the temperature dependence of the phonon dispersions and linewidth across the transition temperature As the 2D alloys with van der Waals force has strong ductility and is a central model in quantum condensed matter physics we anticipate our work will attract a lot of interest from experimentalists and theorists alike Estimate of the measurement times Based on the previous experience on the triple-axis and tof experiments we will measure the phonon dispersions and linewidth along HH 00 and HH in the zones of 440 004 at 10K 100K below TC 160K above TC and 300K The sample would be measured from 1meV to 30 meV with the energy-step of 025meV Each data point would be measured around 1 min Therefore we estimate that 3 days of beam time will be necessary to conduct this measurement Recommended safety precautions controls or procedures These samples do no present safety issues in single crystal form Justification for use of neutron scattering Neutron scattering is most powerful technique for probing the phonons throughout the Brillouin zone The high neutron flux of combined with large crystals will permit to use tight collimation to achieve high energy resolution References  G Fiori et al Nat Nanotechnol 9 768 2014  K S
