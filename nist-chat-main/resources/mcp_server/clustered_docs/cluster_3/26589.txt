STATEMENT OF RESEARCH Sharon S PhilipInvestigating magnetic dynamics in 1T-TaS2-2xSe2x Search for QSL The transition metal dichalcogenides TMD have enjoyed a revival recently due to the interests in their topological properties and unusual superconductivity These materials are prototypical examples of charge density wave CDW instability  Due to imperfect nesting in two dimensions in most of these materials the onset of CDW gaps out only part of the Fermi surface leaving behind a metallic state that often becomes superconducting 1T-TaS2-2xSe2x has got a very interesting phase diagram as shown in Fig1 1T-TaS2 is unique among the TMDs in that it is understood to be a correlation-driven insulator where the unpaired electron in a 13-site cluster experiences enough correlation to form a Mott insulator As for the charge degree of freedom 1T-TaS2 features a number of peculiar CDW phases Upon cooling it turns into a metallic incommensurate CDW ICCDW phase below 550K a textured nearly commensurate CDW NCCDW phase below 350K and finally enters a commensurate CDW CCDW phase below 180K  The low-temperature CCDW phase is characterized by a 1313 structure described as star-of-David clusters  There is one unpaired electron per David-star due to energy gaps induced by the periodic lattice distortion  At the same time the electron correlation effects set in and localize this electron leading to a Mott insulating state with S  12 spins arranged on an ideal triangular lattice 5- 1T-TaSe2 on the other hand undergoes a ICCDW-CCDW transition at 430K and behaves metallic at low temperature Also superconductivity emerges at doping level of x 08 at low temperature 1T-TaS2 is one of the few model spin configurations that may harbor an exotic quantum spin liquid QSL state as proposed recently  The goal of this project is to investigate the proposed QSL behavior in 1T-TaS2 and study the magnetic excitations at low temperature even in the absence of long range magnetic order The orphan spin in geometrically frustrated magnets have paved way to unique quantum-correlated states of matter We are interested in taking a closer look on the behavior and correlations of the unpaired electron at the center of star-of-David clusters We would also like to explore the effect of Se doping on 1T-TaS2 and how this would affect the magnetic properties in the system We have prepared powder and single crystal samples of 1T-TaS2-2xSe2x in the lab The polycrystalline powder samples were obtained by solid state reaction method and was characterized using X-ray diffraction and EDX to make sure we have the right composition and required 1T phase Trigonal P-3m1 Single crystals were synthesized by Chemical Vapor Transport CVT technique using Iodine as the transport agent The obtained crystals were characterized by XRD Single crystal scan along 00L and powder XRD scan and the transport and magnetic properties were measured using Quantum Design PPMS Bulk susceptibility measurements were also attempted but the 1FIG 2 schematic of the monolayer 1T-TaS2 viewed along c axis Thirteen Ta atoms form a unit cell and these u n i t c e l l s f o r m a t r i a n g u l a r

measure the low-energy inelastic spectrum which is ideal for investigating the weak magnetic signals in order to get a direct insight into the low-temperature ground state of 1T-TaS2 and short length magnetic correlations An interesting aspect would be to look at the possibility of collective excitations in the 1313 star-of-David clusters Compelling results have been reported from similar investigations done in the past on emergent excitations in a geometrically frustrated magnet ZnCr2O4  In the cubic spinel ZnCr2O4 upon cooling groups of six spins self-organize into weakly interacting antiferromagnetic loops whose directorsthe unique direction along which the spins are aligned parallel or antiparallelgovern all low-temperature dynamics The experimental evidence comes from a measurement of the magnetic form factor by inelastic neutron scattering the data show that neutrons scatter from hexagonal spin clusters rather than individual spins The image shows inelastic neutron scattering intensities from single crystals of ZnCr2O4 in the hk0 and hkk symmetry planes obtained at T  15 K for   1meV performed using the cold neutron triple-axis spectrometer SPINS at NIST Quantum Spin Liquid behavior was realized in Ca10Cr7O28 and inelastic neutron scattering experiment at MACS was used to explore the dynamics in this material1 We plan to perform inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the Multi Axis Crystal SpectrometerMACS at NIST on cooling to 17K using an incident energy of 3 meV on three samples 1T-TaS2  1T-TaSSe and 1T-TaSe2 Since the charge ordering happens below 180K we decided to look at a broader temperature range 9 different temperature scans at 355K 250K 200K 180K 100K 50K 10K 5K 17K would be ideal Thus we request for 5 days of beam time References
