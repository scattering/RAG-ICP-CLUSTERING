Structural and Magnetic Depth Profiles to Determine Reversibility in Magneto-Ionic GdNiOCoO Among several leading approaches to achieve highly energy-efficient nanoelectronic devices magneto-ionic control of metaloxide interfaces has emerged as an exciting new frontier1 2 Most recently the role of oxygen migration-induced surface chemistry modification has been highlighted in electrical tuning of interfacial magnetic anisotropy3-8 which have shown exciting potentials in magnetic tunnel junctions and other spintronic devices with 2-3 decades lower energy consumption9 10 In collaboration with NIST we have recently demonstrated effective magneto-ionic manipulation of GdxFe1-xNiCoO interfaces11 where the oxygen migration is observed and manifested in a controlled positive exchange bias The presence of the interface-sensitive exchange bias in these getterantiferromagnet-oxide systems offers an ideal platform to probe the nature of the interfaces and to electrically control exchange bias As exchange bias is central to spin-valve type devices such as magnetic tunneling junctions that enable control of magnetic configurations magneto-ionic tuning of exchange bias may lead to substantially more energy-efficient switching than using a magnetic field Furthermore our team has shown by polarized neutron reflectometry PNR that the oxygen migration across the metaloxide interface can be reversibly controlled by an electric field in relatively thick AlOxGdOxCo films12 These results demonstrate an effective path to tailoring the interfacial characteristics and interlayer exchange coupling in metaloxide heterostructures Recently we have observed a significant exchange bias effect in GdNiCoO systems at room temperature after field cooling of the sample Note that the bulk Gd Curie temperature is at 292K thus the ferromagnetic signal comes from the redox-reduced NiCo at the GdNiCoO interface similar to that seen in earlier studies of the GdFeNiCoO system11 Calculations of the change in standard molar enthalpy of formation at 298 K of Gd2O3 from both CoO and NiO 3NiO or 3Co  2Gd  Gd2O3  3Ni or 3C yield values of -1098 kJmol and -1106 kJmol respectively13 The reaction is exothermic and is expected to spontaneously occur at the interface producing an interfacial NiCo layer As a result of the O2- ion migration at the interface the multilayer structure is transformed into GdNiCoNiCoO leading to an exchange bias effect between the ferromagnetic FM NiCo and antiferromagnetic AF NiCoO Figure 1 VSM magnetometry of NiCoOGd in the as grown state field cooled state after 10V application and after second field cooling cycle Figure 2 SQUID magnetometry of Ni33Co66OGd in the as grown state field cooled state and after 20V application 20 15 10 5 0 -5 -10 -15

cooled to room temperature in a 10kOe field With increased temperature while field cooling additional O2- migration is induced due to the thermal excitation leading to an increase of the saturation magnetization Ms which is proportional to the interfacial layer thickness of NiCo Vibrating sample magnetometry was performed on the sample for the as grown AG state field cooled FC state and voltage-conditioned VC state after applying an electric field of 05 MVcm from Gd to NiCoO Figure 1 shows that exchange bias is present after field cooling and further increased by 15 in the VC state Reversibility was not achieved with reversed electric field polarization but could be reset with a second field cooling cycle These results demonstrate the feasibility of electric control of exchange bias using the magneto-ionic approach Irreversibility seen in the 11 atomic ratio of CoO NiO samples is not fully understood but several factors may play a role One factor is that Gd and Ni intermix after field cooling which has been observed in STEM images of similar samples This is likely due to the alloying of GdNi being the most energetically favorable reaction at the interface and heating during field cooling promotes additional alloying PNR data recently collected at NIST also has shown evidence that the oxygen concentration throughout the Gd layer is different between the AG FC and VC states Oxygen is concentrated at the interface in the AG state and redistributes throughout the bulk in both the FC and VC states Due to screening of oxygen by metallic Gd after oxygen is redistributed through the bulk this may also be a source of irreversibility Figure 3 shows PNR data collected at NIST for a FC GdNiCoO sample confirming that reflectivity can be used to both resolve structure and magnetic profile of buried interfaces in these structures To improve reversibility samples were grown in a CoO NiO 21 ratio with the hope of reducing Gd and Ni intermixing Magnetometry for this structure can be seen in figure 2 which exhibits similar effects of exchange bias in the FC state and with a 35 increase in exchange bias after electric field application Similarly reversing the polarity of the electric field does not recover the initial state To further investigate the effect of interfacial mixing of Gd and Ni on reversibility superlattice structures and bilayer structure of CoO and NiO offer a way to eliminate Ni from the interface Having similar characteristics to alloyed NiCoO15-16 NiOCoO superlattices having a terminal layer of CoO would allow the reduction of CoO to Co by Gd at the interface and avoid having Ni intermixing Likewise NiOCoO bilayer structures show tunability in the exchange Figure 3 Fitted data for GdNiCoO plotted as Fresnel normalized reflectivity showing sufficient statistics to resolve spin asymmetry due to magnetic interfacial layer and peak separation to determine structure constant15 and they could be used as a simple structure to probe the effect of Gd and Ni intermixing Proposed experiment This project aims at exploring reversibility in the magneto-ionic effects in GdNiCoO GdNiOCoOn superlattices GdCoONiO bilayers GdNiO and GdCoO using PNR to probe structural and magnetic depth profiles of the interface towards electrically controlling exchange bias in such systems The proposed experiment would use Polarized Beam Reflectometer PBR at the NCNR to determine the nuclear and magnetic depth profiles of the GdNiCoO structure GdNiOCoOn superlattice GdNiOCoO bilayers GdNiO and GdCoO Samples of optimized thicknesses will be thermally treated to promote interfacial mixing as seen in prior GdNiCoO studies and would be masked during deposition to have the dimensions of 5mmx5mm on thermally oxidized Si Samples will be measured in a 15 T field to reach magnetic saturation in the R and R--configuration to probe both structural and magnetic characteristics at the interface Based on an expected Q-range of 005 nm-1 to 12nm-1 allowing us to measure more than 10 total thickness fringes and considering the sample area we expect each sample measurement to take approximately 1 day With one additional day for set up we request a total of 6 days of beamtime on PBR Using PBR we can readily determine the thermal evolution of oxygen migration and to better understand the properties of the various structures especially the interfacial regions In particular the combination of magnetic and structural data will allow us to determine if Ni is indeed preferentially reduced at the interface differences in the thickness of the interfacial layer between various structures whether Gd alloys with Co in the absence of Ni and how oxygen is distributed throughout the Gd layer By reducing the amount of species present at the interface in the superlattice and bilayer structures a clear picture may be achieved by PBR measurements in both interfacial changes and oxygen distribution effects on irreversibility By directly comparing samples with equivalent layer thickness of GdNiCoO GdNiO and GdCoO direct comparisons can be drawn from PBR measurements of structural and magnetic profiles at the interface Preliminary measurements have shown that GdCoO behaves with opposite trends compared to GdNiCoO after voltage application Additionally GdNiO and GdCoO have very different trends after thermal evolution during the field cooling procedure Understanding these simplified structures in the thermally treated state will provide insights to improving reversibility of the electrically controllable exchange bias through the magneto-ionic approach References 1 J Maier Nat Mater 4 805-815 2005 2 C Leighton Nature Materials 18 13-18 2019 3 A Manchon et al J Appl Phys 103 07A912 2008 4
