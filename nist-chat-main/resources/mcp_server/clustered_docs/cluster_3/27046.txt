Kagom Quantum Spin Liquid Quantum spin liquids are have been the topic of many investigations for some time now Theorist have often worked on the two dimensional Kagom lattice while experimentalists have had difficulty producing a sample with perfect equatorial triangles The kagom examples studies are known to be imperfect and many studies have been performed to understand the affect of these imperfections The series of compounds MM3Si2Sn7O16  where M and M are transition metals have a trigonal P-3m1 crystal structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing MO6 and SnO6 octahedra the oxide layer and sheets of oxygen-linked MSn6 octahedra the stannide layer bridged by SiO4 tetrahedra These compounds appear to have a perfect Kagom lattce Many of these compounds show long-range antiferromagnetic AFM ordering transitions close to TN  35 K including the parent compound FeFe3Si2Sn7O16  Preliminary Work We recently used representational symmetry analysis of NPD data to determine the magnetic ground state of FeFe3Si2Sn7O16 in which the only magnetic ions present are layers of high-spin M  Fe2 d6 S  2 arranged on perfect Kagom lattices M  Fe2 in the stannide layer is low-spin d6 S  0  We found that below TN  30 K the spins on 23 of the magnetic ions in the Kagom lattice order into canted AFM chains separated by the remaining 13 which are geometrically frustrated and show no long-range order down to at least T  01 K Although the magnetic propagation vector k  0 12 12 breaks hexagonal symmetry we see no evidence for magnetostriction in the form of a lattice distortion within the resolution of our data Mssbauer spectroscopy showed that there is no static order on the latter 13 of the magnetic ions - ie they are in a liquid-like rather than frozen - down to at least 165 K These spins are dynamic and reside on an edge sharing triangular lattice see purple lines in figure 1 which like the Kagom lattice is highly frustrated This unique partial solution to geometric frustration on the Kagom lattice has generated significant interest in the condensed matter physics community We are conducting a comprehensive set of further experiments including NMR INSQENS and SR in conjunction with ab initio calculations Figure 1 Crystal and magnetic structures of FeFe3Si2Sn7O16 Below 3K the system partially orders into antiferromagnetically coupled stripes on Fe-3f2 sites and dynamic disordered spins on the Fe-3f1 sites Figure 2 Low temperature character of FeFe3Si2Sn7O16 With a critical temperature of 3K 13 of the spins remain dynamic on a triangular lattice Low temperature susceptibility shows an anomaly at 015K Preliminary ToF data right panel also reveals spectral weight below 05 meV and a long range excitation at 1 meV associated with TN Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We wish to study FeFe3Si2Sn7O16 on the Spin Echo spectrometer with its excellent energy resolution The aim is to understand the functional form of the magnetic QENS scattering One great advantage of doing this with polarized neutrons is the observed relaxation will only come from the magnetic signal that flips the spin at the sample position In our high energy transfer data we have observed a slight change in the elastic line width and observe a very broad scattering extending to 05 meV We wish to measure at the Q positions appropriate for Kagom and Triangular antiferromagnetic correlations while avoiding Bragg contamination in the detector Understanding the temperature and Q dependence of this scattering is critical We currently have 10 g of FeFe3Si2Sn7O16 We will require a dilution refrigerator on NSE We wish to study the spin dynamics in 3 different phases First in the paramagnetic state about 5 K here all spins will be dynamic and contribute to the NSE signal Second at 800mK where 23 of the spins are static forming chains Finally at base temperature below 015 K where we believe we will see a very stretched relaxation function from the quantum spin liquid We estimate that 18 to 30 hours will be required per temperature longer at base temperature where the signal is from 13 the number of atoms With 2 Q positions at 3 temperatures we will require 7 days of counting An additional day is required to measure the standard sample to obtain the instrument resolution since our sample in never static and another day is requested for instrument setup and cooling in the dilution insert In total we are asking for 9 days of NSE time Safety Considerations No specific concerns References  T Shnel et al Anorg Allg Chem 624 1998 708  MC Allison et al Dalton Trans 45 2016 9689  C D Ling et al Phys Rev B - Rapid Commun 2017 96 180410  JDM Champion et al Phys Rev B 64 2001 140407  JR Stewart et al J Phys Condens Matter 16 2004 L32 00 02 04 06 08 10 12000005010015020T K ac emumol OeFe4Si2Sn7O16 powderH  0f  1111 Hz015 K
