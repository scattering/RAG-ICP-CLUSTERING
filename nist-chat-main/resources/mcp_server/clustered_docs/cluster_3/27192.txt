Statements of Research Scientific Importance Quantum spin liquids QSLs where the quantum fluctuations prevent the conventional long-rang magnetic orders and leads to highly entangled novel states has recently attracted a great deal of interest in the condensed matter physics  Several candidates with strong frustrations that were claimed to realize experimentally QSL states have been proposed such as the triangular lattice YbMgGaO4  and NaYbO2  the kagome lattice Herbertsmithite  the honeycomb lattice RuCl3  Historically the square lattice has drawn special interest as it is associated with the high-temperature superconductivity In this configuration the competition between the nearest-neighbor interaction J1 and the next-neighbor interaction 52 the so-called 51  52 model can lead to magnetic frustration Previous theoretical works has suggested that QSL state may emerges in this system when both 51 and 52 are antiferromagnetic and 52 51  05  However such QSL state has not been observed because the narrow region with 52 51  05 is not easy to realize in real materials  Recently we found a new square lattice system Gd2SrAl2O7 Fig 1a where the long-range magnetic order is absent down to 02 K This implies the possible presence of QSL state in this compound Inelastic neutron scattering experiments are expected to verify the feature of the possible QSL state and obtain the accurate exchange interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian of the 51-52 model Figure 1 a Nuclear structure of the bilayered system Gd2SrAl2O7 b Single crystal refinement results showing the high quality crystal c Specific heat data in various magnetic field down to 02K Preliminary Work Single crystal x-ray diffraction on the as-grown crystal Gd2SrAl2O7 from floating zone method indicates the high quality with I 4mmm space group Fig1a-b Our magnetic susceptibility down to 03K shows no long-range magnetic order As shown in Fig 1c the specific heat data measured without magnetic field exhibits a broad maximum around 07 K signaling the strong spin dynamics and ruling out any long rang phase transition With the increasing magnetic fields we found long range magnetic phase transitions at 1 K and 3K in field H5 T When applying field up to 6T a totally paramagnetic quantum state shows up indicating the saturation state of spins To understand the nature of the ground state of Gd2SrAl2O7 we intend to set out inelastic neutron scattering at DCS Experiment Plan In order to understand the nature of the observed broad maximum in Gd2SrAl2O7 we plan to do inelastic neutron scattering measurement on DCS at different magnetic fields and temperatures down to 100 mK About 3-4 pieces of calibrated crystals Gd isotope with the total weight more than 1 grams will be aligned in HK0 plane on sample holder The dilution refrigerator is required to reach the lowest temperature to probe the excitation feature A magnetic field of 8 T is required to pull the spins in fully polarized state to measure the well-defined spin waves for extracting magnetic interaction parameters Then the parameters will be used to re-build the zero-field excitation and compare with the observation First the spectrum will be measured at base temperature  100 mK in the short-range ordered state with magnetic fields 0 2 6 T Then the temperature dependence of the spectrum will be measured at zero magnetic field from the base temperature 100 mK to 50 K for example at 100 mK 500 mK 15 K and 50 K Considering 8-12 hours are necessary to collect each data set thus we kindly ask for 6 days for the proposed experiment The work is part of the DOE Early Career Award project Local site magnetic susceptibility for quantum materials by polarized neutron diffraction References  L Savary etal Rep Prog Phys 80 016502 2017 Y Zhou etal Rev Mod Phys 89 025003 2017  Y Shen etal Nature 540 559 2016 J Paddison etal Nat Phys 13 117 2017  T Han etal Nature 492 406 2012  A Banerjee etal Nat Mater 15 733 2016  O Mustonen etal Nat Comm 9 1085 2018  l Ding et al Phys Rev B 100 144432 2019
