Investigate the magnetic excitation and superconducting resonance in FeSe1-xSx Scientific Background and Significance The evolution of magnetism nematic order and superconductivity in the multi-degree-of-freedom system is one of the theme issues in the study of iron-based superconductors As the structurally simplest system FeSe exhibits distinct phase relations with iron pnictides fine-tuned by hydrostatic pressure External pressure suppresses the nematic order induces the magnetic long-range order and enhances superconductivity  Besides isovalent S doping induces chemical pressure and efficiently adjusts physical properties of FeSe1-xSx as well S substitution expands the band widths and reduces the electron correlations 2 Meanwhile the nematicity in FeSe is suppressed leaving a nematic critical point at around x017  The superconducting SC states were proposed to be distinct separated by the nematic critical point as marked by SC1 and SC2 in Fig 1 5 Thus FeSe1-xSx offers a good platform for studying the interplay between correlation magnetism nematicity and superconductivity Figure 1 The phase diagram of FeSeS reprinted from ref  Figure 2 Comparison of magnetic excitation in FeSe grey line and FeS blue points and black line reprinted from ref  The magnetic excitations of the end members FeSe and FeS have been studied via neutron scattering 7- see Fig 2 At the base temperature the low energy excitations of both compounds emerge from 10O in the orthorhombic cell notation signifying the persistence of the stripe-type fluctuation in the absence of magnetic order However the strength of the stripe fluctuation is much reduced in FeS and the competing Neel-type fluctuation at 11O observed in FeSe was not observed in FeS In order to understand the phase diagram of the multi-degree-of-freedom system it is important to investigate how low energy magnetic fluctuations evolve from FeSe to FeS with the development of electron correlation and suppression of nematic order The unconventional SC mechanism is another important issue that attracts a lot of attentions and is coupled to electronic and magnetic properties Neutron resonance peaks commonly seen in iron base superconductors offer the fingerprint that indicates sign change between different gaps Such resonance was observed at the stripe wave-vector 10O in FeSe at the incommensurate position around the Neel wave-vector 11O in heavily electron-doped LiFeOHFeSe but not in FeS As distinct SC states in FeSe1-xSx were proposed in nematic SC1 phase and tetragonal SC2 phase Fig 1 it is critical to study the evolution of SC pairing via neutron resonance signals Aims of Proposed Experiment We propose to conduct inelastic neutron scattering on FeSe09S01 and FeSe08S02 to 1 Compare the magnetic excitation in the nematic phase FeSe09S01 and tetragonal phase FeSe08S02 2 Search SC resonance signals in SC1 phase in FeSe09S01 and SC2 phase in FeSe08S02 and if found compare the resonance feature such as energyTc scale and wave-vector distribution Sample Preparation and Preliminary Results We have successfully synthesized FeSe1-xSx with various doping levels The lattice parameters systematically shrink from FeSe to FeS as expected Fig 3 Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements show sharp superconducting transitions Beamtime have been granted for magnetic excitations at higher energies on chopper spectrometer at J-PARC Measurements at sub-10meV energy range will be needed to map out the whole spectrum Figure 3 a Grams of FeSe08S02 single crystals b Doping dependence of the c-lattice parameters Choice of Instrument We apply to conduct the proposed experiment on the BT7 thermal triple-axis spectrometer BT7 provides the suitable coverage of energy and momentum transfer needed for the experiment sub-10 meV and 12 -1 respectively In addition the combination of double focusing PG monochromater velocity selector and PG filter will bring high flux as well as clean background for the measurement Experiment Plan Magnetic signals around 100O and 110O are of particular interests We plan to co-align 5 grams of samples into the HK0 scattering plan for each composition We assume 10min per inelastic point below for beamtime estimation 1 Constant-Q scans will be performed If 21 E points are needed for one Q and T with step size 05meV then 35 hrs will be needed of one single scan We will perform such scan at Q100O for signal and 12500O for background below and above transition temperature Tc Then 14 hrs will be needed 2 Similarly another 14 hrs for Constant-Q scans at Q110O and Q1251250O 3 Constant-E scan that along H00 direction across the wave-vector 100O or 110O will be performed to reveal the Q-dependence of excitation Such scan with 15 Q points will take 25 hrs We assume to perform 6 scans at different energies This will take 15 hrs Repeat such mapping at T both below and above Tc would take 30 hrs The above 3 steps take 58 hrs in total Considering 12 hrs of sample loading initial alignment and temperature cooling we estimate 3 days for one composition and 6 days for two compositions Reference  J P Sun et al Nat Commun 7 12146
