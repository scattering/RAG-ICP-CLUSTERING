Magnetic Structure in the Li2FexCo1-xP2S6 Solid Solution Series Timothy Diethrich and Efrain Rodriguez - University of Maryland College Park There are three well-known types of ferroic ordering ferromagnetic ferroelectric and ferroelastic A much lesser known type of ferroic ordering is ferrotoroidic ordering We define a toroidal moment as the local moment that arises from a local vortex of magnetic moments1 A ferrotoroidic material is introduced when the toroidal moments of the material spontaneously align at the Nel temperature TN23 Our groups aim is to further support and expand the current understanding of ferrotoroidic materials We propose to use the high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer BT-1 to determine the magnetic structure of the Li2MxM1-xP2S6 solid solutions Background One example of an ideal candidate for ferrotoroidic materials are transition metal thiophosphates We chose the thiophosphates because of their relation to olivines which are well established ferrotoroidic materials The thiophosphate groups shown in yellow and grey Figure 1 are very similar to the phosphate groups in transition metal olivines such as LiCoPO43 The focus of this experiment is the Li2MxM1-xP2S6 solid solutions where M  Fe and M  Co The end members of this system Li2FeP2S6 and Li2CoP2S6 are trigonal systems with the space group P-3m1 Figure 1 depicts the layered honeycomb crystal structure of Li2FeP2S6 found by Takada et al using x-ray diffraction4 This group performed electrochemical experiments to study the electrode property of Li2FeP2S6 recognizing its potential use as a sulfide cathode4 However to the best of our knowledge with the exception of preliminary studies from our group no magnetic properties of this material have been studied and no neutron diffraction experiments have been performed on these thiophosphates Figure 1 Layered honeycomb lattice of Li2FeP2S64 Figure 2a Laboratory x-ray powder diffraction patterns of Li2FeP2S6 Preliminary Results Phase pure powders of Li2FeP2S6 and Li2CoP2S6 have been synthesized via a solid-state method The resultant X-ray powder diffraction patterns and fits can be seen in Figure 2a and 2b The large broad reflection in both patterns at 18 is due to Kapton tape that contained the air sensitive samples in an inert atmosphere The Co sample 1b has a small sulphur impurity 37 and 47 With the exception of this small impurity to the best of our knowledge both of these samples are free of impurities and fit to analyze on BT-1 The refinement confirmed the P-3m1 space group and resulting lattice parameters were a  601936  c  656759  with a volume of 206075 3 for iron and a  600385  c  656786  with a volume of 205034 3 for cobalt SQUID magnetometry measurements have also been performed on the iron and cobalt thiophosphates at 100 Oe The resultant data can be seen in Figure 3 Li2FeP2S6 demonstrates a transition from an ordered antiferromagnetic state to a disordered paramagnetic state at 25 K There are no visible magnetic impurities The Curie-Weiss fit demonstrated an effective magnetic moment of 4871 B for each Fe2 center We predict that the magnetic space group of this material is P-3m1 This transition at 25 K further supports our theory that this material could be Figure 2b Laboratory x-ray powder diffraction patterns Li2CoP2S6 The large and broad peak at 18 is due to Kapton tape keeping the samples from hydrolyzing in air Figure 3 SQUID magnetometry measurements at 100 Oe of Li2FeP2S6 left and Li2CoP2S6 right The AFM transition for the Fe compound is at 25 K There is no apparent order for the Co compound ferrotoroidic However just by changing the transition metal from iron to cobalt the ordering at low temperatures seems to disappear Figure 3b The resultant susceptibility plot demonstrates complete paramagnetic behavior The Curie-Weiss fit for the high temperature paramagnetic region of this plot results in an effective moment of 373 B for each Co2 center Proposed Experiment Because the toroidal moment is directly related to the magnetic moments this study seeks to understand this magnetic symmetry transition from the iron thiophosphate with an antiferromagnetic ordering at 25 K to the cobalt thiophosphate with complete disorder even at low temperatures In order to study this transition we propose to study three solid solutions as well as the two end members Li2FeP2S6 Li2Fe075Co025P2S6 Li2Fe05Co05P2S6 Li2Fe025Co075P2S6 and Li2CoP2S6 We propose to analyze each of these compositions above and below 25 K to identify any magnetic symmetry that may or may not be present in these samples If there are magnetic peaks present we would like to measure order parameter scans and potentially some intermediate temperatures To the best of our knowledge no neutron experiments have been performed on these lithium transition metal thiophosphates which means that this experiment will be novel and help further expand our understanding of ferrotoroidic materials and these transition metal thiophosphates We would like to use the high-resolution powder diffractometer BT-1 For this experiment the Ge311 monochromator with the 60 collimator would be the best fit because of the high neutron intensity high resolution at low scattering angles and because we are focused on magnetic ordering in our samples We will have between 1-3 g of each sample composition As mentioned above we would analyze each of these materials above and below their ordering temperature 5 K and 60 K as well as some intermediate temperature Because we have a total of five samples at around 5-7 hrs per run and 3 temperatures per sample we are requesting four days to account for data collection sample changes heating and cooling and any unexpected challenges that may arise References 1 Schmid H On ferrotoroidics and electrotoroidic magnetotoroidic and piezotoroidic effects Ferroelectrics 2001 252 41-50 2 Spaldin N Fiebig M Mostovoy M The toroidal moment in
