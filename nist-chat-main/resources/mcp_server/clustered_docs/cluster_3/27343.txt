The Brillouin Zone Dependent Magnon Cross-section in the Spinel Mn3O4 Introduction Magnetically frustrated and orbitally degenerate materials provide a natural means of coupling structural and magnetic degrees of freedom123 The spinels are minerals possessing the general chemical formula A2B23X42- where the A and B are divalent and trivalent metallic cations and X are oxygen ions in most cases The ions occupying the tetrahedral sites constitute a diamond lattice and the ions in the octahedral sites form a corner-sharing pyrochlore lattice4 In this proposal we request time to investigate the magnons in Mn3O4 This is part of our larger effort to study the phonons in this material to investigate the coupling between strain and magneticorbital degrees in Mn3O4 Figure 15 We have recently measured the low-energy acoustic phonons in the spinel MgV2O46 In this case V3 has an orbital degeneracy leff1 S1 and displays a corresponding Jahn-Teller distortion at 63 K which relieves the magnetic frustration so that magnetic order can set in at 42 K We have shown an acoustic phonon anomaly associated with the shear elastic modulus C11-C122 over intermediate wavevectors and the Jahn-Teller transition in MgV2O4 Mn3O4 is different as it displays an orbital degeneracy in the eg levels Figure 1 We wish to compare this case to that of an underlying degeneracy in the t2g orbital level as in MgV2O4 In this proposal we request time on MACS to map out the magnons and potentially low-energy phonons in Mn3O4 While being based on the same spinel cyrstallographic structure Mn3O4 is different to MgV2O4 in two respects First it is based on Mn3 which as a 2-fold orbital degeneracy associated with the eg instead of a 3-fold in V3 related to the tg degeneracy Theories discussing coupling between strain and orbital degrees of freedom have all been cast in terms of a 2-fold orbital degeneracy7 Second the Jahn-Teller transition in Mn3O4 occurs at a very high temperature of 1433 K ca  116 to a tetragonal unit cell with magnetic transitions occurring below 41 K A further distortion to an orthorhombic unit cell occurs below 35 K8 Mn3O4 compared to MgV2O4 Regarding the magnetic in Mn3O4 the tetrahedral A sites and the octahedral B sites are selectively ordered by Mn2 and Mn3 The orbital degeneracy is associated with the Mn3 site and below TN the magnetic moments order in a Yafet-Kittle type ferrimagnetic structure9 In this proposal we will align the crystal in the HK0 plane and study the magnons over several Figure 1Figure 1 Schematic of the Mn23 arrangement in Mn3O4 and the crystal field scheme of both ions Figure taken from Ref Nii et al Figure 2 The acoustic phonon anomaly associated with the shear C11-C12 mode in MgV2O4 The upper panel plots the low energy acoustic phonon dispersion while the lower panel plots the linewidth as a function of temperature illustrating the increased linewidth at the orbital ordering transition Brillouin zones This is required for our future phonon measurements with a triple-axis to facilitate a disentangling of both cross sections The use of MACS will allow us to measure many Brillouin zones at low-energies with good energy resolution therefore separating out the magnon and phonon cross sections This will facilitate future measurements of the low-energy acoustic phonons using a triple-axis spectrometer There are two points we wish to address in this experiment 1 Obtain a map at low-momentum transfers of the magnon dispersions to facilitate future measurements of the acoustic phonons at large-Q Brillouin zones 2 To repeat this at temperatures above the Neel temperature to also obtain a complete momentum space map of the magnetic fluctuations Why MACS and Planned Analysis To facilitate future measurements of the phonons we need a complete mapping of the magnon dispersion extracting its momentum dependence This needs to be done both in the magnetic and paramagnetic phases While a magnon dispersion has been reported10 we believe based on early triple-axis work that it is incomplete After our measurement we will apply a RPA analysis to model the spin-waves Sample We currently have a large single crystal of Mn3O4 shown in Figure 3 synthesized using the floating zone technique by our collaborators at the University of Winnipeg Experiment We request 6 days on MACS to study the Brillouin zone dependence of the magnons in Mn3O4 The sample will be aligned in the HK0 plane and we will construct full magnon dispersion curves by performing a Horace scan We will spend 4 days at low temperatures and then the rest of the time above the Neel temperature We will initially use an Ef5 meV to cover the energy range from up to about 15 meV We are requesting MACS for this given the need to measure the magnetic fluctuations which we expect to exist at low momentum transfers Future We anticipate that this study will be extended to investigations as a function of magnetic field as large strain has been observed in field induced phases above several Tesla However before this study an understanding of the low-energy acoustic phonons at zero field must be established 1 Y Tokura Phys Today 56 50 2003 2 A J Millis Nature London 392 147 1998 3 T Rudolf et al New J Phys 9 76 2007 4 P W Anderson Phys Rev 102 1008 1956 5 Y Nii et al Phys Rev B 87 195115 2013
