Gaithersburg Maryland 20899 USA Scientific Importance Incorporation of Mn ions into III-V semiconductors forms III1-xMnxV alloys and results in a ferromagnetism mediated by the excessive carries in the materials1 2 GaMnAs is the prototypical example of this class of dilute magnetic semiconductor and can be easily grown on GaAs substrate3 4 The major factor determining the magnetic anisotropy of a GaMnAs film is the epitaxial strain between the GaAs substrate and the film Specifically the easy magnetization direction of a GaMnAs film is in-plane under compressive strain while it is out-of-plane under tensile strain5 6 A GaMnAs film directly grown on GaAs is under compressive strain and results in the in-plane magnetic easy axes The incorporation of P into the GaMnAs makes the lattice parameters smaller than the GaAs and the GaMnAsP film can be under tensile strain depending on the amount of P in the material The successful growth of GaMnAsP film with out-of-plane magnetic easy axis was indeed reported in earlier studies by few groups7-11 The investigations further showed the magnetic anisotropy of GaMnAsP changed from the in-plane to the out-of-plane direction with increasing the composition of P in the film10-13 Preliminary Work Figure 1 Structure of the graded Ga1xMnxAs1yPy film a Sketch of the eight-layer graded sample b Dark-field TEM image of the sample

effect in a quaternary alloy Ga094Mn006As1yPy with P composition y graded along the film thickness and its relationship with the recently discovered chiral domain walls in such samples due to broken inversion symmetry14 15 The P concentration y along the growth direction was controlled by holding the As2Ga flux ratio constant near 10 and adjusting the P2 flux in steps with the P2As2 flux ratio increasing from 0 to 12 in 8 steps The Mn flux was kept constant throughout the sample at a value corresponding to x  006 The resulting structure of the graded Ga1-xMnxAs1-yPy films are sketched in Figs 1a and 1b High-resolution x-ray diffraction HRXRD characterization of the crystal quality is shown in Fig 1c Importantly reciprocal space mapping of the 224 diffraction peaks shows that all eight peaks line up along Qx indicating that the constituent layers have the same unrelaxed in-plane lattice parameter15 This confirms that with increasing the P concentration the strains in the layer progress from compressive in the nearest to the substrate region to tensile in successive layers Figure 2 Magnetic characterization of the graded Ga1xMnxAs1yPy film a Hysteresis loops at 5 K and b

Figure 2 contains magnetic hysteresis loops and temperature dependences of remnant magnetization obtained on the graded sample after field cooling in weak magnetic fields The results suggest the graded samples behaves as two single-domain ferromagnets with orthogonal anisotropies ie one part of Ga094Mn006As1yPy film has an easy axis in the plane along 10 direction another part of this film has an easy axis out-of-plane along 00 direction For example in Fig 3a as the out-of-plane field is swept down from 5000 Oe blue curve the total out-of-plane component of magnetization beginning decreases at 1500 Oe as the preferred in-plane domain rotates from a field-polarized out-of-plane orientation to in-plane At a coercive field of -200 Oe a sharp 180 switch in magnetization occurs indicating the reversal of perpendicular domain The in-plane measurement red curve shows analogous behavior but with the total in-plane component of magnetization beginning decreases above 2500 Oe as the magnetization of out-of-plane Ga094Mn006As1yPy rotates from its in-plane orientation to out-of-plane Planar Hall resistance PHR and anomalous Hall resistance AHR measurements in Fig 2c corroborate the existence of two single-domain ferromagnets with orthogonal anisotropies Experimental Plan The observed phenomenontwo single-domain ferromagnets with well-defined orthogonal anisotropiesis contradictory to our intuition about the graded sample which was expected to form a multi-domain magnet system with gradually-varied anisotropy along the growth direction To confirm the existence of two well-defined domains and identify the position of domain boundary in this system we propose to leverage the depth-resolution of polarized neutron reflectometry PNR Our experiment would examine on a 1 cm2 cleaved portion of the same 100 nm thick graded GaMnAsP film Mn  6 P  0-24 in 8-steps for which characterization results are shown in Figs 1 and 2 Somewhat surprisingly this step-graded sample geometry lends itself very nicely to PNR and as shown in Fig 3 the shape of the spin asymmetry allows us to easily distinguish between the fully saturated magnetic state 3a abruptly stepped magnetization at any particular interface 3b and 3c and a smoothly graded magnetization 3d Using a standard closed-cycle cryostat and the 07 T electromagnet on the Polarized Beam Reflectometer instrument we would collect the following PNR measurements 1 T  5 K H  07 T in plane to establish the saturation profile 2 T  5 K H  02 T and 001 T to establish how the magnetization orientation changes as a function of depth when the field is relaxed We expect to see magnetization of the perpendicular domain disappear as it rotates out-of-plane 3 Repeat steps 1 and 2 at T  40 K to examine the temperature dependence of magnetic domain boundary This gives us a total of 6 scans From previous experience and q-range we require based on our simulations we expect each scan to take approximately 075 days adding 1 days for overhead mounting aligning cooling we ask for 5 days of beamtime to complete our measurements with sufficient statistical quality for analysis Figure 3 The top panels show the spin asymmetry for the corresponding magnetization model shown in the panel directly below The grey dashed line in the spin asymmetry plots denotes the line at zero spin asymmetry In the sample profile panels along the bottom row the nuclear profile is shown in black near the top and the magnetization is shown in blue at the bottom References 1 T Dietl H Ohno F Matsukura J Cibert
