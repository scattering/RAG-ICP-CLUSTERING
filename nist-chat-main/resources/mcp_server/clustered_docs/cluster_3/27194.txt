Visualizing the evolution of magnetic order with electronic doping in a strongly correlated electronic system Qi Song Spencer Doyle Julia A Mundy Principal NIST Collaborator William D Ratcliff  corresponding proposer Abstract The rare-earth nickelate compounds RNiO3 are strongly correlated materials with a rich phase diagram including metal-to-insulator transitions with concomitant changes in magnetic ordering1 We have used atomically precise synthesis to grow the first epitaxial thin films of cerium-doped NdNiO3 and have demonstrated an unexpected quenching of the insulating phase predicted by the canonical RNiO3 phase diagram with as little as 5 cerium-doping Moreover for less than 5 Ce doped NdNiO3 we have observed a new metal-to-metal phase transition which is associated with band structure reconstruction We propose to use neutron scattering on BT-7 to determine associated changes in the magnetic ordering Our work could pave the way toward identifying a novel antiferromagnetic conducting phase for spintronics applications Narrative description of the science to be pursued The strongly correlated rare-earth nickelate family hosts a remarkable variety of electronic and magnetic phases These include observations of antiferromagnetic spin order2 charge ordering3 potential multiferroicity4 and even a suggested quantum spin liquid state5 Of particular note are the sharp metal-to-insulator transitions MITs in nearly all the RNiO3 compounds the origin of which have been hotly contested for decades Concomitant with this thermally-driven loss of metallic behavior is a change in magnetic order from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic Figure 1 displays the evolution of the MIT temperature TMIT and the magnetic ordering temperature TN with the cationic radius expressed as a tolerance factor of the A-site rare-earth cation As the radius of R decreases the tilting of adjacent non-degenerate nickel-oxide octahedra increases altering the electronic and magnetic properties of the RNiO3 by presumably opening an insulating gap between the oxygen 2p and nickel 3d orbitals7 Theoretical insight has proposed Mott physics8 charge order9 or bad metal models10 rooted in octahedral structural distortions to explain the nature of the MIT Additional experiments on epitaxial thin films have demonstrated that epitaxial strain11 film stoichiometry12 and thickness13 can all change the TMIT making the nickelates a powerful platform to explore the relationship between structural electronic and magnetic properties in a quantum material Here our work demonstrates for the first time that the TMIT can also be tuned with electron doping and a small amount of Ce doping generates a new metal-to-metal phase transition We choose the compound NdNiO3 as our model system both because it has a thermally accessible MIT and because TMIT and TN coincide in the bulk1 enabling us to track the evolution of both from bulk values Using molecular beam epitaxy we have stabilized the first epitaxial thin-films of cerium-doped NdNiO3 CexNd1-xNiO3 noting that CeNiO3 is unstable in the Figure 1 Phase diagram of the RNiO3 family of materials in the space of the A-site R cation size tolerance factor1 bulk Cerium in its 4 oxidation state serves as an electron donor to the system and lowers the formal valence state of the Ni3 We have found that with 5 cerium insertion the film becomes metallic to the lowest temperatures Fig 2 Moreover we also have observed for 1 and 3 Ce doped NdNiO3 there is a new phase transition from metal to metal such a transition has often been associated with a charge-density wave spin-density wave or other types of complex order in prior materials From our photoemission measurement at ALS we obtain different fermi surfaces and band shift above and below the metal-to-metal transition temperature Finally we have performed resonant x-ray scattering at ALS on the Ni edge which has further shown the presence of a scattering peak along the    direction below the transition temperature indicating order Here we propose to definitively study this transition with neutron scattering Proposed Experiments at BT-7 We will use polarized neutron scattering on BT-7 to interrogate the magnetic ordering as a function of temperature in our CexNd1-xNiO3 thin films Our measurements will determine whether the antiferromagnetic order observed in the bulk NdNiO3 compound persists in the CexNd1-xNiO3 thin films Neutron scattering would provide a sensitive probe of the antiferromagnetic spin state as the spin structure of the E-AFM phase is characterized by a Q   pc magnetic vector   0  orthorhombic notation2 Using neutron scattering we will track the intensity of the quarter-integer magnetic ordering peaks as a function of temperature to correlate the observed TMIT with the onset of magnetic ordering Recent studies on LaNiO3 have suggested that LaNiO3 which was previously thought not to exhibit any magnetic ordering could host metallic ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic14 states at low temperature Antiferromagnetism and conductivity are typically contraindicated quantities Theoretical studies of the nickelates have suggested however that the extreme covalency between the oxygen 2p and nickel 3d states can stabilize these states simultaneously Here holes in the oxygen band promote conductivity while still presenting the exchange interactions which mediate antiferromagnetism This model would be pronounced in the case of the strongly charge-ordered nickelates such as NdNiO3 in comparison to LaNiO3 The CexNd1-xNiO3 thin films provide a unique opportunity to test this model as conductivity is introduced without altering the structure in the compound with the highest parent phase antiferromagnetic ordering temperature Our measurements on BT-7 will provide a unique opportunity to test this model and could lead to the identification of new class of antiferromagnetic metals with applications for spintronics15 Justification for the amount of beam time requested Figure 2 a X-ray diffraction data demonstrating coherent growth of cerium-doped NdNiO3 thin-films on

dependent study of the four distinct Ce-doping compositions shown in Fig 2 where the TMIT is controllably changed This will directly map out the magnetic order and construct a correlated study of the electronic magnetic and structural properties of these new phases The estimated counting time is based on experience with other thin film systems on the BT-7 instrument Here the films will be 20 nm thick and 1 cm2 in area Thus we estimate significant counting times of 1 hourpoint will be required based on experience with Ca2RuO4 films of similar thicknesses Due to the lattice match between film and substrate we will spend 05 days constructing a map of reciprocal space to locate the relevant reflections relative to substrate reflections This will be followed by an order parameter measurement taken at 1 hourpoint We estimate the order parameter will take 24 hours There will also be time required to mount additional samples we will be using a specially designed low background mount designed for work with thin films but these are of limited supply In our previous neutron scattering measurement performed on the SPINS cold triple-axis we have successfully observed the AFM order in our same thickness pure NdNiO3 thin film on NdGaO3 substrate as shown in Fig 3 We believe that this experiment will be viable on BT-7 now that the velocity selector is present and by working at 137 meV to reduce the fast neutron background We would benefit from the higher flux of the thermal instrument Previous scientific accomplishments and NCNR track record Julia A Mundy is a leader in the field of
