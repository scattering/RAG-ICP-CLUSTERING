Magnetic Excitations of Ising-like D-Er2Si2O7 Scientific Significance The Ising model is one of the most famous and simple models of classical magnetism still used today which also has applications far beyond magnetism such as neural networks of magnetism still used today A quantum mechanical version of the Ising model is that of the Transverse Field Ising Model TFIM The TFIM Hamiltonian consists of a nearest neighbor term that promotes ordering along the Ising direction in zero-field and a perpendicular to the Ising direction magnetic field term that drives the spins to be parallel to the magnetic field The interplay of these terms in the Hamiltonian leads to a quantum phase transition at a field Hc where the system changes from an ordered state along the Ising direction to a field polarized paramagnet state along the magnetic field direction The TFIM is one of the most tractable models with a QPT and has thus been studied extensively theoretically including in the burgeoning field of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics  However there are only a few currently known TFIM systems CoNb2O6 quasi-1D  BaSrCo2V2O8 quasi-1D 4 and LiHoF4 3D  At first glance it is surprising that there are only three TFIM systems and none of them are two-dimensional Here we propose experiments on a new Ising-like system that shows promise to be another TFIM system Recently our group has been examining the rare-earth silicates R2Si2O7 where R is a trivalent lanthanide element Previously we have discovered that Yb2Si2O7 hosts a quantum dimer magnet ground state with a field induced phase reminiscent of a Bose-Einstein condensate  Recent efforts have turned to the D-type Er2Si2O7 spacegroup P21b D-Er2Si2O7 has a distorted honeycomb motif that lies in the b-c plane shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b indicating quasi-2D interactions may dominate The Er3 atoms reside in two inequivalent magnetic sites with a trivial crystal field symmetry therefore the principal axes of the g-tensor do not point along simple crystallographic directions and leads to two different g-tensor axes as shown in Figure 1a In addition to the honeycomb motif this system is of interest as previous work by Leask et al found that D-Er2Si2O7 undergoes an antiferromagnetic ordering transition at zero-field the g-tensor is highly anisotropic gxx  26 gyy  34 gzz  134 and Monte Carlo simulations with classical Ising spins accurately reproduce the magnetization data with the field primarily along the average Ising direction referred to as the m direction shown in Figure 1d  Additionally through their Monte Carlo calculations Leask et al was able to reproduce a field induced phase transition at 05 T for field along the m axis which shows evidence - in measurement and calculation - of being a first order transition with significant hysteresis This Ising-like behavior naturally brings forth the idea of studying the system with a field transverse to the average Ising direction Preliminary Results We have synthesized powders of D-Er2Si2O7 via solid-state reaction from stoichiometrically mixing Er2O3 and SiO2 reagents and heating at 1500C numerous times These powders were then pressed into dense rods and grown into single crystals using a Crystal Designs Optical Floating Zone Furnace  We performed powder neutron scattering was performed on D-Er2Si2O7 using the Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer MACS The inelastic neutron scattering INS data at zero-field shows two gapped excitations consistent with Ising-like exchange Figure 2a The lower branch Branch 1 can be attributed to a first-order phase transition observed by Leask et al in their magnetization data with a field applied 55 from the m average Ising Figure 1d axis  This branch is not observed in the 025 T data Figure 2b as the 025 T data was obtained after going to 5 T and is therefore indicative of the field-induced phase due to the large hysteresis loop As the field is increased towards the quantum phase transition at 14 T the inelastic excitation Branch 2 is nearly driven to zero energy After crossing the quantum critical point the excitation then increases in energy as shown in Figure 2b Subsequent to the MACS experiment we performed magnetization measurements shown in Figure 2c which were performed on a single crystal at 750 mK with the field applied transverse to the average Ising direction m The magnetization data shows evidence for a phase transition occurring at approximately 14 T consistent with the mode softening field seen in powder INS when corrected for demagnetization effects The powder INS and magnetization measurements show strong evidence that D-Er2Si2O7 realizes the TFIM If D-Er2Si2O7 is found to be an example of the TFIM it will be one of only a few known Ising materials with transverse-field-tuned quantum phase transitions that are accessible with continuous magnetic fields and has the potential to be the only quasi-2D example Choice of instrument DCS is an excellent choice for this experiment due to its high-resolution time-of-flight capabilities and variable sample environments Experiment Plan Two grams of D-Er2Si2O7 single crystals will be coaligned on a custom-made Cu mount with the vertical field direction being perpendicular to the m direction which is the average Ising axis The sample will then be loaded into a 3He refrigerator that will be loaded into a compatible magnet with a strength of at least 5 T Data will be taken at 400 mK with H  00 T 05 T 10 T 125 T 15 T 175 T and 50 T and with an empty canister for background subtraction The low field data 175 T will allow for the measurement of the excitation gap which can give access to the critical exponents of the quantum critical point as well as observing the excitations in proximity to the quantum critical point The high field data 50 T will allow for the extraction of exchange parameters using linear spin wave theory We will use 5  neutrons in the medium-resolution mode to allow for a resolution of 009 meV With a relatively large moment 67 B we expect each scan to take approximately 14 hours therefore we request 5 days of beam time in order to perform these measurements
