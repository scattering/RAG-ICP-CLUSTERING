Potential topological magnon in a Van der Waals magnet Scientific Importance In recent years the study of magnetic Van der Waals VdW materials has been evolving rapidly  This is because magnetism in true two-dimensional limit ie single layer provides opportunities we never had before For example one may examine the validity of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless BKT transition of the XY model  by studying a single layer XY magnet More importantly the technological implications of VdW magnets cannot be over-stated 3- all the revolutionary applications for graphene applies equally well to VdW magnets with an additional active tuning parameter ie magnetism inherently embedded in the system At the epicenter of this emerging field many new and unexpected findings begin to surface One of the most interesting discoveries is the non-trivial topological nature of magnon bands in VdW magnets  Applying topological band theory  to magnon bands one may find Chern topological magnon  Dirac magnon  and 2 topological magnon 1 Topological magnon in Van der Waals magnetic materials may provide the long-sought solution for magnon spintronics 1 Preliminary Work NaMnCl3 crystalize in the trigonal system space group R-3 No148 The lattice constants and crystal angles are a  b  65910  c  186270  and 5  5  90 5  120 respectively The Mn2 ions form a honeycomb lattice as shown in Figure 1 a The crystal is easily cleaved 1 indicative of the Van der Waal nature of inter-layer bonding In a study of XMnCl3 X  Na K Rb Cs single crystals 1 it was found that NaMnCl3 has the lowest ordering temperature TN  65 K A powder neutron diffraction study suggests that the magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic planes aligns anti-parallel along the c-axis 1 These preliminary experimental findings point to a picture of strong ferromagnetic in-plane interactions with weak antiferromagnetic out-of-plane interactions in a quasi-two-dimensional system Quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb lattice host rich possibilities for identifying topological magnons Theoretically the ferromagnetic  zig-zag and stripy 1 phase have undergone detailed studies Experimentally to the best of our knowledge CrI3 is the most celebrated and only example of topological magnons reported in a Quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb lattice  Thus more experimental effort is desirable for furthering our understanding of this subject To understand the proposed system NaMnCl3 we first performed symmetry analysis using information from the powder experiment 1 The Maximal magnetic space group analysis MAXMAGN 1 showed the possible magnetic structure as in Figure 1 a Taken as the initial ground state we ran SpinW 1 simulations to gain further insights into the spin dynamics We adopted a general J1-J2 model with J1  -02 meV and J2  -002 meV They are estimated using the Weiss molecular field model We first note a Dirac-like band touching at K 13 13 0 as shown in Figure 1 c We have performed dispersion cut through the circled-out K-point and found linear dispersion in its vicinity Furthermore by adding further interaction terms we found that this linear band touching is preserved Our simulation indicates that the spin structure of NaMnCl3 must host symmetry-protected Dirac node at K-points According to the theoretical studies of topological magnons on honeycomb lattice such symmetry-protected K-point may be gapped out by introducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya DM interaction  Such gapped magnons can be characterized by the Chern invariant  We thus introduce a next-nearest neighbor interaction D002 meV as shown in Figure 1 d In Figure 1 e we show simulations with and without DM interactions taken into account which are represented by dash and solid lines respectively We see that a very small DM interaction is sufficient to open an experimentally observable topological gap at K-point Figure 1 a Crystalmagnetic structure of NaMnCl3 Mn2 ions are the purple spheres Cl-

We propose to conduct this experiment using DCS in NCNR considering the suitable energy range coverage and excellent energy resolution We plan to study the magnetic excitations in a Van der Waals magnetic material NaMnCl3 A large single crystal 5 g will be used for this experiment The crystal will be aligned in the H K  scattering plane We will first use neutron with incident wavelength 5  286  Ei  10meV for a general survey of the excitation spectrum Based on the survey result we will choose the appropriate incident energy for further scans We would first carry a Psi angle scan from 0 to 360 with 2 step size at T  2 K Using Mslice we have verified the E-Q coverage of this setting on DCS will provide the desired spectra We will then need to collect the same data at T  100 K This high temperature data will be used for background subtraction using the detailed balance method Based on our previous experience we would ask for 6 days of beam time Reference  K S Burch D Mandrus and J-G
