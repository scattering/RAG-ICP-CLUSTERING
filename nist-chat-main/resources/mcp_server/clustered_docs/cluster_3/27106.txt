Magnetic excitations of a spin liquid parent compound in an applied field An important challenge in condensed matter physics currently is the search for the quantum spin liquid QSL state This exotic magnetic ground state arises when the spins evade conventional magnetic long range order down to 0 K and possess long range quantum entanglement1 The spin-12 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice a two dimensional lattice of corner-sharing triangles provides an ideal system for the realization of a QSL One way to explain the QSL ground state is as a resonating valence bond state in which singlets of entangled spins fluctuate over the lattice but never form static order2 Through the possibility of obtaining long-range quantum entanglement of magnetic spins a better understanding of the QSL ground state opens avenues to develop materials for topological quantum computing and storage applications3 Barlowite4 Cu4OH6FBr has been the subject of recent interest from the condensed matter physics community due to its structural similarity to herbertsmithite Cu3ZnOH6Cl2 one of the best experimentally realized candidates to be a QSL5 So far herbertsmithite has been extensively studied however a small fraction of excess Cu2 impurities on the interlayer Zn sites results in interlayer magnetic coupling that obscures the intrinsic QSL behavior complicating the study of its low energy spin dynamics6 Barlowite is another rare example of a material that contains nearly ideal S12 kagome planes It contains Cu2 ions on its interlayer sites causing it to have a transition to long-range magnetic order at T  1015 K Barlowite therefore is not a QSL material however DFT calculations show that substituting the interlayer site with nonmagnetic Zn2 or Mg2 should suppress the long-range magnetic order and lead to a QSL state7 It is therefore of interest to study the magnetic ground state of barlowite since it may shed light upon the fundamental excitations of kagome planes of spin-12 Cu2 ions AC susceptibility measurements on an aligned single crystal of barlowite Figure 1 left reveal that the magnetic transition indicated by the peaks in AC susceptibility is dramatically affected by the application of a small in-plane magnetic field 0H  1 T This magnetic field scale is small compared to the characteristic spin-spin interaction energy scale of 150 K inferred from Curie-Weiss analysis of the high temperature magnetic susceptibility The sensitivity of the magnetic ordering in barlowite suggests that there is a small energy scale presumably within the interlayer moments in addition to the dominant spin-spin interactions of the kagome moments Heat capacity measurements in an applied field show that magnetic signatures persist up to 0H  9 T Figure 1 right suggesting the presence of both small and large energy scales in the magnetic degrees of freedom While bulk property measurements can provide valuable information to truly elucidate the magnetic excitations of barlowite in an applied magnetic field we propose to carry out inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of barlowite under a magnetic field Deuterated single crystals of barlowite of total mass 235 mg have been prepared and co-aligned We measured elastic neutron scattering on this sample at both zero field BT-7 25685 and SPINS 25715 ORNL HB-1A and at 0H  10 T BT7 25931 The zero field measurements uncovered an ordered pinwheel magnetic structure at base temperature8 The two magnetic transitions shown in Figure 1 involve the successive ordering of different spins at T  10 K the interlayer spins begin ordering with short-range correlations consistent with the lack of a sharp anomaly in the heat capacity data This is followed at T  6 K by sudden long-range ordering of the kagome spins Our preliminary in-field elastic measurements show the evolution of magnetic structure in an applied field at base temperature and between the two magnetic transitions Figure 2 left9 Figure 1 Left AC susceptibility X and Right Molar heat capacity and magnetic heat capacity measurements of a single crystal of barlowite in an applied field parallel to the ab plane kagome layer We have successfully measured spin excitations in this sample in zero magnetic field at MACS NCNR 25086 and 26021 which serves as a solid foundation for our current proposed study These measurements have revealed magnetic excitations around the 1 0  family of peaks as well as hexagonal scattering that is enhanced at low energy transfer10 A representative plot is shown in the right panel of Figure 2 This suggests the presence of spin waves in this QSL parent compound Investigating the effects of an applied field on this weakly ordered state should help elucidate which spins drive the magnetic ordering such as interlayer versus kagome as well as the nature of their coupling For example a high 10 T field is believed to close the spin gap in herbertsmithite It would be interesting to see if a similar field can change the correlations of the kagome moments in barlowite MACS is an ideal instrument to carry out this proposed study due to its ultra-high flux low background and exceptional efficiency in covering momentum space which is ideal for small samples The 11 T vertical field magnet with a base temperature of 15 K will be required The monochromator will be used in the double-focusing mode to maximize the signal Constant energy slices at judiciously chosen energy transfers will be carried out as a function of magnetic field for several temperatures between the base temperature and the two zero-field magnetic transition temperatures to illuminate how the excitations evolve as a function of applied field and temperature We will measure an empty sample holder to accurate estimate the background from aluminum and we will measure the sample above TN2 to subtract the background phonon contributions to the spectrum yielding the spin wave excitations This set of measurements will allow us to establish barlowites magnetic field-temperature phase diagram Considering the low count rate expected for a spin-12 system and observed in our previous experiment as well as the range of applied fields and temperatures required to map the phase diagram we expect a total beamtime of 10 days will be required to successfully carry out this experiment The proposed experiment will elucidate the fundamental magnetic excitations of barlowite in an applied magnetic field A better characterization of this material will ultimately aid the understanding the quantum spin liquid state of the substituted analog Zn-barlowite Figure 2 Left Elastic neutron scattering at T  15 K and T  8 K on the 1 1 0 magnetic Bragg peak at
