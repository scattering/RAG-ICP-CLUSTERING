 Page 1 of 3 Direct observation of topological triple-point phonon in TaSb using inelastic neutron scattering Statement of Objectives We request 8 days of inelastic neuron scattering beamtime on Double Focusing Thermal Triple-Axis Spectrometer BT-7 beamline to measure the topological 3-fold degenerate phonons in single crystalline tantalum antimonite TaSb Given the rapid development of novel classes of topological fermions the parallel observation of new class of topological phonon will be a milestone to advance both topological materials and phonon sciences Scientific Importance The past four years have witnessed a revolution of topological materials Since the discovery of the topological Weyl semimetals1-3 and their close kin of Dirac semimetals4-7 the family of topological fermions has rapidly grown such as the nodal family semimetals8-11 the 3-fold 6-fold and even 8-fold degenerate fermions12 among other non-conventional fermions In particular the recent high-throughput symmetry-based topological quantum chemistry method13 enables an exhaustive list for all topological electronic states14-17 greatly broadened the topological fermion family far beyond original expectation Contrary to the flourishing advancement on topological fermions the parallel development in bosonic systems such as phonons is still scarce Recently it has been predicted that the topological double Weyl and Dirac phonons exist in transition-metal monosilicides MSi M  Fe Co Mn Re and Ru 18 and has been further observed in the phonon spectra of FeSi19 Despite the initial success the topological phonon is still in its infant stage Very recently the triple-point topological phonons have been predicted in WC-type crystal TaSb20 This can be considered as a parallel bosonic version of the 3-fold fermion Fig 1c which has been confirmed in MoP with ARPES Fig 1d and has attracted wide recent attention since its discovery Nature 201721 In this proposal we plan to experimentally measure the triple-point topological phonons near the predicted Q-values Fig 1 f g We plan to measure both the phonon dispersion and lifetime If successful this study will add an important topological class to bosonic systems beyond the existing Dirac and Weyl phonons In addition to the observation we plan to closely exam the topological robustness against external perturbation Topological phonons have a series of advantages over topological fermions to study the topological robustness against perturbation such as much less stringent experimental condition compared to ARPES the possibility to exert more sample environment like magnetic field and external pressure to see the evolution of topological states etc which are still not possible in ARPES As a result the topological phonon system can also offer a clean platform to examine the interplay between topological protection the evolution of topology and degeneracy and degeneracy lifting at an unprecedented clarity Page 2 of 3 Figure 1 a The tetra arc furnace with Czochralski puller for synthesizing single crystalline high melting point materials b The TaSb single crystal grown in our lab c The comparison between the conventional Dirac fermion Weyl fermion and the novel 3-fold degenerate fermion Our planned study is the phononic version d The experimental observation of the 3-fold fermion in MoP with ARPES e The crystal structure of TaSb and its Brillouin zone f The predicted 3-fold degenerate phonons along the -A direction in TaSb g The computed phonon spectral function along high symmetry lines Preliminary Work We have successfully grown the proposed TaSb single crystals in our own lab using a tetra-arc furnace which is a unique method to combine arc furnace with a Czochralski puller shown in Fig 1a b Choice of Instrument We choose BT-7 beamline to perform the proposed experiment where the phonon dispersion relation as a function of external perturbation such as temperature can be greatly benefited through the high neutron flux thanks to good match of the thermal neutron energy range and the double focusing design In addition the recently installed velocity selector will be used to eliminate the higher order neutron contaminations and greatly reduce the background which will be extremely crucial for this type of measurements Experiment Plan Sample fabrication TaSb belongs to the space group P6m2 No 187 with WC-type crystal structure Prior to neutron experiment we will cleave the sample to find the large single crystalline domain in the crystal rod like Fig 1b and characterize the crystal orientation using single-crystal diffractometer on campus We will then co-align the samples Moreover using X-ray Laue method we were able to co-align them with mosaicity 1deg Currently we have 2 grams of sample and the total sample mass planned for this measurement will exceed 10 grams to increase the signal-to-noise ratio Data collection According to the phonon dispersion the triple-point phonons are located along 000 - A001 direction We plan to measure the phonon dispersions along - M0500 - K05050 and - A001 direction along with M- K and A-L directions Given the low energy of the 3-fold phonon 18meV and the highest optical phonon is as low as 25meV we choose an incident neutron energy Ei40meV and carry out the triple-axis measurements at a Q-interval 02 along each direction However when approaching the triple phonon for instance for the - A phonons we choose a finer q-step such as 005 while for the - M phonon we will use conventional 02 step size Since the phonon intensity matters we will collect longer statistics than the usual way to only resolve phonon energy This is called one dataset To see the evolution of the topological protection we plan to use temperature as a knob from based temperature 5K to room temperature with one more intermediate temperature at 150K 3 temperatures in total We will also measure the background by removing the sample away from neutron beam and measure the signal of empty space to improve the signal-to-noise ratio Beamtime justification Considering the cooling and alignment time and background measurement time and the 5 total temperatures we estimated a total 8 days to full characterize this sample to resolve the topological 3-fold phonon and study the topological protection against temperature perturbation The intensity along one branch will be roughly twice as much as the other direction well within the range of TAS respond to previous BTAC review Data analysis We will carry out the full ab initio density functional perturbation theory calculations on this systems to resolve the nature of the topology in a phonon system The hallmark of success include a The agreement between theoretical and experimental dispersion relation b The asymmetric phonon intensity on the left and right of the Q-value for the tri-phonon node where Q-Qs intensity is twice than the QQs due to the degeneracy Supporting measurements The TaSb is an extremely interesting system which also host topological Weyl fermions Therefore we will carry out a systematic electrical measurements to be prepared for the double topology topological-phonon - topological electron interaction studies The magneto transport measurement will be carried out in our Physical Property Measurement System PPMS from 2K to 300K where a negative magnetoresistance signatures the Weyl fermion We will also carry out thermal transport measurements in the same temperature range Expected outcome a The measured full phonon dispersion relation in TaSb across a wide temperature range b The linear dispersive phonon along the -
