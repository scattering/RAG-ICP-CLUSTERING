Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in 4f element based magnetic heterostructures Ramesh C Budhani Morgan State Univeristy - Baltimore MD -21251 Brian Kirby NIST Center for Neutron Research Understanding the origin of chiral magnetic order driven by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya Interaction iDMI at the interfaces of heavy metal - ferromagnet oxide - ferromagnet and quantum Hall insulator - ferromagnet interfaces is of significant current interest The iDMI is intimately connected to the presence of non-trivial spin textures together with spin orbit torque and Rashba - Edelstein physics in such systems A variety of techniques including Brillouin light scattering ferromagnetic resonance magneto-optical Kerr effect spin polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy resonant X-ray scattering and polarized neutron scattering have been used to measure the strength of iDMI in the past Most of the studies of iDMI thus far have focused on heterostructures consisting of strong spin - orbit interaction metals such as Pt W Ta Ir interfaced with 3d ferromagnets like Fe Co Ni and their alloys The other systems albeit less studies are heterostructures of 3d ferromagnets with elemental oxides such as MgO and Al2O3 A very interesting class of magnetic heterostructures consists of thin films and multilayers of 4f elements such as Gd with 3d transition metals like Fe and Co For example amorphous thin films of GdxFe1-yCoy1-x are known to exhibit interesting manifestations of antiferromagnetic exchange between the 4f and 3d magnetic moments These include compensation effects near room temperature for x  025 and a robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy PMA Since the strength of 4f and 3d magnetic orders in these alloys has distinct temperature dependence the temperature range over which compensation and PMA are seen depend sensitively on the Gd concentration Amorphous films of GdFeCo are also known to display large magnetostriction whose strength can be accentuated by increasing the cobalt concentration In recent years GdFeCo alloy films in particular and 4f-3d alloys in general have attracted much attention due to their PMA for the studies of spin-orbit-torque SOT driven magnetization reversal and persistent oscillations of magnetization The stability and dynamics of topological spin excitations Skyrmions of different chirality in 3d-4f magnetic systems have also been the topics of considerable attention in recent years It has been reported that the iDMI in PtFeGdCoMgO multilayers stabilizes ferrimagnetic Nel skyrmions due to a combined effect of the Rashba and atomic spin - orbit coupling However it has been also noted that in relatively thick several nm films of FeCoGd segregation of Gd creates a graded interface that results in a bulk DMI effect The heterostructures of 4f elements and their oxides with 3d ferromagnets have been investigated recently For example chiral Nel domain walls have been observed in asymmetric heterostructures of the type PtCoGd and PtCoGdO which move at a large speed  600 ms under the action of a transport current Similarly enhancement of spin orbit torque has been observed in PtCoGd heterostructures Theoretical calculations and spin torque FMR measurements on FeNirare-earth heterostructures reveal that holmium produces the maximum spin Hall torque on the ferromagnet We are currently focusing on evaluating and understanding the origin of iDMI in heterostructures consisting of b-WFeCoGdHo b-WFe75Co25Ho b-W Fe75Co25Gd and in similar systems where Ho has been replaced by its nitride and oxide While the magnetic state of these heterostructures is being probed with transport FMR and bulk magnetization measurements the DMI here is an interface driven phenomenon For a deeper understanding of the physics of these systems it is therefore important to address the state of magnetic order at the interface with tools such as Polarized Neutron Reflectivity PNR The PNR technique also allows studies of the atomic scale order and atomic segregation at the interface We have successfully synthesized b-tungsten films by magnetron sputtering in a controlled ArN2 environment Such films are known to have much larger spin Hall angle compared to that of Pt We are currently fabricating b-WGdFeCo bilayers b-WGdFeCoHo and b-WGdFeCoHoN multilayers in a UHV sputtering system Preliminary studies of bulk magnetization on these systems reveal PMA and compensation effects that show a rich temperature dependence Additionally we have found that the PMA is strongly dependent on composition Our objective is to address the magnetic and atomic scale structure of these interfaces with PNR A very recent feasibility measurement was conducted at PBR for a 10 mm x 10 mm b-WGdFeCob-W grown on SiO2  Si The top panel of Figure 1 shows non spin-flip reflectivities at 50 K while the bottom panel shows temperature-dependent data plotted as spin asymmetry All measurements were conducted with 3 T applied in-plane We observed oscillations above background over 6 orders of magnitude in reflectivity with a pronounced temperature dependence While modeling of the data is incomplete Fig 1 demonstrates the suitability of our samples for PNR We propose to use PBR to measure three identical samples with concentrations varying from  x  02 - x 03 compositions that show differing PMA at room temperature We will then carry out room temperature measurements as a function of reduced in-plane field after saturating in a 3 T in-plane field If the perpendicular anisotropy is indeed depth-dependent the shape of the magnetic depth profile will with decreasing field as the magnetization of stronger PMA regions will relax out of plane and become invisible in this geometry at higher fields than that of weaker regions For each of the three samples we would like to measure from 30 T - 05 T in 05 T steps as well as in a 002 T near-remanent state We expect each measurement to take 6 hours thus we are asking for 6 days of beamtime Figure 1 top reflectvity for a test sample in 3 T and 50 K bot temperature-dependent spin asymmetry in 3 T
