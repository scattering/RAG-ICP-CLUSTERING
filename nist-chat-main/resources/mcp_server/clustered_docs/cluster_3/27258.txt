INTERFACIAL EXCHANGE COUPLING IN ADVANCED MAGNETIC TUNNEL JUNCTION FILMS INTRODUCTION Magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs with ultrathin constituent layers magnetized perpendicular to the film plane have been implemented in commercial magnetic random access memory systems The constituent layers of this MTJ includes two nm-thick Co-Fe-B alloy films separated by a MgO tunneling barrier The material properties and processing tolerance of this system leads to certain limitations including ONOFF ratio for electrical discrimination of the MTJ state data write speed and MTJ lateral dimension scaling We have developed a different material system for MTJ fabrication that could permit advances in these metrics In particular we have developed Fe-Pd based alloy films with higher magnetic anisotropy than Co-Fe-B enabling lateral dimension scaling down to 10 nm Moreover we have determined that the Fe-Pd alloy films can be incorporated into a synthetic antiferromagnetic SAF trilayer a Fe-PdZFe-Pd where ZIr or Ru that is predicted to respond faster to a write operation than a ferromagnetic material of similar magnetic properties Finally we have developed techniques to impart the large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy PMA of Fe-Pd on a proximal layer of the half-metal Co2MnSi which intrinsically exhibits in-plane anisotropy combining the large magnetic anisotropy of the Fe-based intermetallic with the large spin polarization of the Co-based half-metal for a large ONOFF ratio Preliminary studies of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of coupled SAFFerromagnet heterostructures have been carried out at the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Division The sample was grown by direct current magnetron sputtering at the NIST Magnetic Engineering Research Facility on single-crystalline MgO substrates with 001 orientation of the polished surface A MgO substrate was coated by a 15 nm thick Cr adhesion layer and a 5 nm thick Pt layer followed by the FePd6 nmIr05 nmFePd6 nm SAF 10 nm Co2MnSi layer Additionally the sample was capped with a bilayer of Ru3 nm  Ta2 nm to prevent damage During deposition of the layers the substrate was kept at a fixed temperature of 350 C and a post-deposition heat treatment of 500 C for one hour was applied in ultrahigh vacuum Cube-on-cube registry was achieved between the substrate 001 and overlaid films 001 in which there is no rotation between the in-plane axes of the substrate with respect to the layers eg MgO00111  CrPtFePd00111 Figure 1 shows x-ray diffraction results indicating high sample quality Figure 2 shows in-plane and perpendicular room temperature hysteresis loops for a SAF  10 nm Co2MnSi sample as measured with vibrating sample magnetometry The two offset perpendicular hysteresis loops shifted 02 T are consistent with a moderate interlayer exchange coupling energy 1 mJm2 for the FePd6 nmIr05 nmFePd6 nm trilayer with large PMA while the square in-plane hysteresis loop is consistent with easy-plane magnetization within the Co2MnSi layer We propose carrying out polarized neutron reflectometry investigations to evaluate the extent to which the Co2MnSi magnetization rotates from easy-plane to perpendicular when approaching the interface with the SAF Or similarly for a given planar applied field how the constituent FePd layers in the SAF rotate away from the perpendicular direction in the vicinity of the Co2MnSi interface Figure 1 Out-of-plane symmetric x-ray diffraction data with indexed reflections for SAF  Co2MnSi sample Figure 2 In-plane and perpendicular room temperature hysteresis loops for the SAF  10 nm Co2MnSi sample EXPERIMENT We propose to use PNR essentially to perform room-temperature depth-resolved magnetometry corresponding to the in-plane and perpendicular loops shown in Fig 2 Such scans will allow us to characterize vertical domain wall formation at the interface between the SAF which naturally exhibits perpendicular anisotropy and the Co2MnSi which has intrinsic in-plane anisotropy For both geometries we will use the 07 T electromagnet saturate the sample at -05 T then measure at 10 mT 50 mT 100 mT 150 mT and 500 mT For the field in-plane scans the magnetic field H will be oriented vertically ie perpendicular to the wavevector transfer Q meaning the non spin-flip reflectivities will provide sensitivity to the component of the depth-dependent magnetization M parallel to H while the spin-flip will reveal any coherent in-plane magnetization perpendicular to H For the perpendicular loop the electromagnet will be mounted on the beamline with H nominally 5 degrees offset from Q In this geometry the depth dependence of in-plane magnetization is encoded completely in the spin-flip channel The 5 degree offset is intended to provide a bias for any in-plane magnetization component such that the magnetization direction will be coherent across the thickness of the film REQUIRED BEAMTIME We expect each scan to take approximately 12 hours Factoring in setup time for 5 field conditions in two geometries we expect to need 6 days of beamtime
