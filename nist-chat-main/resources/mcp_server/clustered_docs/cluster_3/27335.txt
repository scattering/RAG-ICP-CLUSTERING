Spin Transport and magnetic interactions in Y3Fe5O12NiOPt heterostructures Egecan Cogulu and Andrew D Kent Center for Quantum Phenomena Department of Physics New York University Mingzhong Wu Department of Physics Colorado State University Patrick Quarterman and Brian Kirby NIST Center for Neutron Research The spin Seebeck effect SSE where a thermal gradient in a ferromagnet generates spin current is a widely used method to generate and study spin waves Further there has been increasing interest in characterizing spin transport specifically in thin insulating antiferromagnets AFM This is not only because insulating AFM can transmit spin waves efficiently while providing electrical isolation but also because it is of fundamental interest to characterize how the spin transport depends on the nature of the magnetic order in the AFM We have prepared ferromagnet-antiferromagnet-heavy metal heterostructures Y3Fe5O12YIG-NiO-Pt to study spin transport flow through NiO  A temperature gradient is created by applying an ac current in the heavy metal Pt while the spin current is detected using the inverse spin Hall effect associated with the spin Seebeck effect at twice the ac frequency A lock-in technique is used to measure this 2nd harmonic signal as a function of temperature and in-plane magnetic field which sets the magnetization of YIG layer inset Fig 1 We have found a sharp increase in the SSE amplitude around 110 K Fig 1 The fact that the peak is not present in our control samples YIGPt suggests that its origin is either the NiO layer or the YIGNiO interface In addition we have conducted X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism Absorption Spectroscopy XMCD to gain insight into the magnetic order Fig 2 For 5 nm thickness of NiO we observe a change in the circular dichroism of nickel and iron near 100 K which we associate with a change in the coupling of Fe and Ni moments Further our experiments with varied NiO thickness show that the peak position does not depend systematically on the NiO thickness Therefore we hypothesize that the YIGNiO interface plays a crucial role in the enhancement of the spin-transport efficiency Figure 1 Temperature dependence of the Spin Seebeck Effect in YIGNiOPt and YIGPt samples The sharp increase of the SSE amplitude around 110 K is only present in samples with NiO layers The inset shows the measurement geometry and a sine fit to the field angular dependence Fig 2 leads us to suspect that at low temperature there are uncompensated interfacial Ni spins that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Fe spins in the YIG As temperature increases this coupling weakens and the interfacial Ni spins are free to follow the applied magnetic field However this is really just a best guess and true understanding of the system requires a depth-sensitive probe Thus we propose to use polarized neutron reflectometry PNR to determine the location and the coupling of spins near the YIG interface PNR will also provide the magnetic details of the complex GGG  YIG interface Gd and Y are known to vertically migrate at this interface leading to a magnetically distinct sublayer which antiferromagnetically couples to the bulk of the YIG 2- We have prepared a sample of YIG20 nmNiO5 nmPt5 nm epitaxially grown on a 10 mm x 10 mm 111 Gd3Ga5O12 GGG substrate We wish to measure non spin-flip reflectivities at temperatures of 5 K 50 K 110 K 200 K and 300 K in in-plane fields of 3 T saturation and 10 mT remenance These measurements should allow us to characterize any uncompensated magnetization at the NiO  YIG interface and the corresponding temperature-dependent behavior While spin-flip scattering could in principle be a valuable probe of rotated magnetization vectors in this system simulations suggest that the associated magnetic scattering length densities are small enough that wed have little practical chance of resolving such signals in a reasonable amount of time and that we can treat any spin-flip scattering present as essentially negligible in modeling the non spin-flip scattering We expect each condition to require 24 hours of counting thus we request 10 days of beamtime  Yinzhang Chen et al AIP Advances 9 105319 2019  A Mitra et al Scientific Reports 7 11774 2017  Juan M Gomez-Perez et al Physical Review Applied 10 044046 2018  Michael Roos et al BR-17 2019 Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials Las Vegas Nevada Figure 2 XMCD of nickel and iron inside the heterostructure The change around 100 K suggest the coupling between iron and nickel magnetic moments change near the SSE peak temperature
