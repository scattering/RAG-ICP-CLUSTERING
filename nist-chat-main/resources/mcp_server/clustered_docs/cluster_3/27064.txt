Investigating Skyrmion Ordering in a Room Temperature Skyrmion Material via Neutron Tomography Melissa Henderson Benjamin Heacock Dusan Sarenac Dmitry Pushin November 11 2019 Introduction Topologically non trivial spin texturesin particular magnetic skyrmionshost great promise for future spintronic applications namely logic elements and high density memory devices owing to their mobility via ultra low current densities and quasiparticle like behaviour Their topological nature wherein a continuous change of homotopy is forbidden mathematically gives rise to energy barriers required to introduce these singularities to transform between topologically distinct states This idea of topological protection invokes a sense of stability and an afforded degree of freedom against deformations into a topologically trivial state These nontrivial Berry curvatures gives rise to exotic emergent electrodynamics such as the topological hall effects and multiferroic behavior This coupling can be thought of as a one-to-one association of skyrmion lines with quantized magnetic flux thereby identifying skyrmion creation or destruction with emergent magnetic monopoles Such objects have been proposed to underlie certain skyrmion destruction mechanisms and current-driven skyrmion de-pinning effects which should theoretically produce a real space forking behaviour of these tubes We have synthesized a room temperature polycrystalline intermetallic skyrmion previouslyo Zn MnC 8 8 4 reported in  of dimensions 34 mm x 33 mm x 30 mm The helical and skyrmion phases were verified via SANS measurements at room temperature in zero field and at 310 K in a field of 250 G respectively Although the initial skyrmion phase SANS pattern was a ring indicative of multiple-q domain structures fig1 a using a method described in  upon rotating the sample in the static magnetic field configuration about the vertical axis qy direction the characteristic sixfold symmetric SANS pattern started to emerge Figure 1 SANS triangular lattice skyrmion diffraction pattern at a temperature of 309K in a magnetic field of 250 G parallel to the neutron beam after 0 30 40 rotations total Primary and secondary diffraction rings demonstrate hexagonal symmetry characteristic of a triangular skyrmion lattice with the secondary peak forming 12 peaks We then performed a tomography technique outlined in  which consisted of measuring neutron diffraction spectra as a function of sample rotation This data in combination with a phase retrieval algorithm followed by a tomographic reconstruction has been used to generate a scattering length density map of the skyrmion which provides novel insight into the bulk structures and interactions of these skyrmion tubes Based off the three dimensional reconstruction it appears as though the skyrmions form tubes which penetrate the sample to a depth on the micrometer scale Moreover there appears to be some exotic behavior such as skyrmion tubes splittingforking in the two dimensional scattering length density slices fig 2 Figure 2 Three dimensional scattering length density map showing bulk tubular structure and two dimensional slices at three different angles showing potential splittingforking of skyrmion tubes Current-induced depinning of originally segmented skyrmion strings magnetic monopole-antimonopole pairs was proposed in  in the MnSi metastable SkS-L phase to explain a decrease in topological hall signal after repeated current pulses were applied to a string of skyrmions It was stipulated that the origin of such an anomalous decrease lies in the current-induced depinning of the segmented skyrmion strings which resulted in current-induced topological unwinding of these preexisting topological defects monopole-antimonopole pairs  Moreover similar forking phenomena has been proposed in the metastable SkS-X to explain thee Co SiF 1x x skyrmion to helimagnetic transition which was observed to occur via coalescing of skyrmions to form line-like structures using magnetic force microscopy  They argue the mechanism responsible to be these emergent magnetic monopoles wherein two ingoing skyrmions merge or a single ingoing skyrmion line splits in two creating monopoles and antimonopoles respectively which then zip through to the surface or through the bulk ie coalescing via hedgehog defect proliferation  Additionally such merging behavior has also been observed dynamically between current-driven moving skyrmions and pinned skyrmions in a PtCoTa multilayer film using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy STXM  Sequential STXM images after injecting 20 ns current pulses revealed the annihilation of a moving skyrmion with a pinned skyrmion and subsequent pinning of neighboring moving skyrmion  This interaction of the merging of a moving skyrmion with a pinned skyrmion could possibly produce the aforementioned forking phenomena owing to the discontinuous change of homotopy that is required to merge two topological states thereby yielding these topological monopole-antimonopole defects which manifest themselves in this forking structure The investigative methods described thus far are limited to indirect surface level probes that have yet to observe such forking structures direct bulk observations remain elusive Our tomography technique is a novel probe for skyrmion bulk structures We report that our observed forking behaviour results from three possible mechanisms The first lies in the fact that we are in an above room temperature phase and so transverse thermal fluctuations of the skyrmion lines as described in  could give rise to merging and subsequent forking of the skyrmions This could be easily determined by tomographically examining the metastable phase that is present at 170 K The second mechanism could fall out from pre-existing topological defects which manifest themselves as these monopole-antimonopole pairs in the tomography measurements upon performing the symmetry-breaking rotation sequence we de-pin these segmented skyrmions and as they follow the relative rotating magnetic field they unwind producing this forking behavior Finally as we perform the rotation sequence and pick up different skyrmion grains skyrmions intersect each other andor topological defects either merging or annihilating ultimately producing the forking behavior Performing the rotation sequence by breaking down one symmetric rotation into small steps and performing our tomographic reconstructions at each angle would assist in discerning amongst the above mechanisms Furthermore it has remained a highly non-trivial issue as to how the conservation of skyrmion charge is compatible with lattice form changes and transitions to topologically trivial magnetic states Therefore tomographically examining the reversible helical-skyrmion transition will provide novel bulk measurements of skyrmion creation and destruction mechanismsdiscrete changes in winding number mathematically expressed via singularities Experiment We propose to tomographically examine the creation and destruction of the skyrmion tubes from and to the helical ground state phase to the triangular skyrmion lattice phase upon application of an applied field of 50 G 100 G 140 G 180 G 200 G 220 G 250 G Moreover we will perform the tomography technique before applying the symmetry-breaking rotation sequence and during at small angular increments in each direction of      and for one full symmetry breaking sequence to investigate the skyrmion tube3 6 9 21  51  81  dynamics We will perform these measurements at a wavelength of in a reciprocal space range of6  We require 5-10 minutes at each one degree increment over a 30 degree angular range totaling 5-100058 0 1 hours per tomographic scan Finally after performing the 20 rotations of the sequence to fully order the skyrmion lattice we will examine the reversible transition into the helical phase by lowering the field Time requested  35 hours to perform 7 tomography scans as a function of field while transition from helical to skyrmion phase  30 hours to perform symmetry-breaking skyrmion ordering sequence at 3 degree increments  5 hours to perform tomography scan after 20 rotations of rotation sequence  20 hours to perform 4 tomography scans upon lowering
