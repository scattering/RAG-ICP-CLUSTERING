Inelastic neutron scattering study on the spin dynamics of the rare-earth selenium with ordered phase under magnetic field Introduction and state of science With the competition between the interacting energies and geometrical properties of the crystal lattice at a specific given site the geometrically frustrated magnetism could lead to the degenerate ground states and has attracted a lot of attention in the past decades One exotic state is quantum spin liquid state in which spins could not find a stableexclusive ordering state over long entangled distances and not order even in the zero-temperature limit 1  Although this phase transition cannot be described by the Landaus conventional paradigm of symmetry-breaking  the original driving force of the quantum spin liquids is believed to play a prominent role in high-TC superconductors theory  and quantum computers  Therefore searching for materials with quantum-spin-liquid state is a major direction in condensed matter physics However examples in real materials are scarce Geometric frustration systems are considered as a big group of candidates for quantum spin liquids including the structures of triangle Kagome honeycomb pyrochlore and hyperkagome etc The triangular lattice magnet YbMgGaO4 has invoked a lot of interest in the search of spin liquids with strong spin-orbit coupling however the GaMg disordering could interfere the QSL stability NaYbCh2 ChO S Se system has a hexagonal structure with the space group of R-3m the Yb ions form a triangular lattice in the ab plane and are well separated by the nonmagnetic A-site Na ions Fig 1  Therefore it naturally removes the disordering issue and the system is an ideal platform for the research of QSLs and its promising applications The large degeneracy to the ground state of this material could be presented The induced strong quantum effects could lead to exotic physical properties Specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements on the single crystals and polycrystals Fig 2 revealed no structural or magnetic transition down to 50 mK and it is very interesting to obtain the dynamic spectra of the system Among the common approaches to identify a spin liquid exploring the wave-vector and intensity dependence of the materials dynamical spin response by neutron scattering is the most promising one Previously we have applied inelastic neutron scattering technique to study the crystal electronic field CEF of NaYbSe2 over the temperature range 5 K - 300 K which were different to the ones of NaYbO2 and NaYbS2 and could be explained as the larger distortion and smaller electronic band gap Moreover the magnetic field-dependence of the heat capacity clearly demonstrated that the magnetic field could induce an ordered phase at 6T with the magnetic wavevector of 13 13 0 Based on the previous measurement on the spin-dynamics of NaYbSe2 at 100mK and 0T we want to apply inelastic neutron scattering technique to study the magnetic flied-dependence of the NaYbSe2 single crystals the spin-dynamics at 01 K in this proposal Previous result We have successfully synthesized NaYbSe2 single crystals Fig2 After grounded the small crystals into powder we carried out X-ray diffraction Fig 2 The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern has a goodness-of-fit The specific heat and magnetic susceptibility data Fig 2 did not reveal structural or magnetic transition down to 50 mK The Curie-Weiss fitting from T  150-300 K reveals a Curie temperature of CW  -5984 K with an effective moment of eff  424 B As the magnetic field increases a broad peak was observed around 7T which suggest an ordered phase Moreover the CEFs of NaYbSe2 were different to NaYbO2 and NaYbS2 Experimental Procedure We propose to use the Multi Axis Crystal Spectrometer MACS to measure the magnetic field dependence of NaYbSe2 spin dynamics to obtain the original driving force of the system From the density-of-state measurement of NaYbSe2 we got the top band is 11meV there MACS fits the experiment very well Using the flux our collaborator from the Institute of Physics Dr Qingming Zhang has synthetized a 1g single crystal The sample will be aligned on HHL plane the magnetic field applied along 1-1 and the sample maintained below T01K using a dilution refrigerator Based on the field dependence of the heat capacity 10T magnet would be apllied To measure the gapless modes we will keep Ef 25 meV for MACS to achieve the best accessible energy resolution below an energy transfer of 1 meV For the higher energy excitations we will use Ef 37meV The zone of 13131 will be measured along HH and 00 directions at base temperature Including the background measurement at T10 K with the mixture out we estimate that 6 days of beam time will be necessary As the spin-12 triangular antiferromagnet is a central model in quantum condensed matter physics and the quantum spin liquid phase one of the best example yet elusive exotic quantum state we anticipate our work will attract a lot of interest from experimentalists and theorists alike Recommended safety precautions controls or procedures These samples do no present safety issues in single crystal form References  J A M Paddison et al Nat Phys 13 117 2016  L Balents Nature 464 199 2010  P W ANDERSON Science 235 1196 1987  A Kitaev Annals of Physics 321 2 2006  W Liu et al Chin Phys Lett 35 117501 2018  M Baenitz et al Phys Rev B 98 220409 2018  T Ohtani et al Mat Res Bull 22 829 1987
