Polarized Neutron Diffraction on Spin-Triplet Superconductor Candidate UTe2 Scientific Importance Conventional and most unconventional superconductors have electrons with antiparallel spins forming spin-singlet Cooper pairs Spin-triplet superconductors TSC on the other hand have electrons forming Cooper pairs in spin-triplet state analogous to the equal spin paring ESP state in the superfluid 3He  The spinful and dissipationless electron-electron bound states in TSC make these materials great hosts for topological superconductivity Majorana physics and therefore quantum computing  Until recently only a few materials have been proven to be TSC candidates including UPt3  Sr2RuO4  UBe13  the organic Benchgaard salts  and heterostructures consisting of ferromagnet and s-wave superconductors  Recently experimental evidences of spin-triplet paring have been discovered in UTe2  and the system soon draws attentions in the community UTe2 is a heavy fermion superconductor with TC  16 K and an orthorhombic unit cell 81 U atoms form parallel chains along a-axis inside trigonal prisms of Te atoms as shown in Fig 1 A Curie-Weiss fit on the magnetic susceptibility data reveals an effective moment on U atom close to the 5f2 or 5f3 free ion value at high temperature 1 No long-range magnetic order has been reported down to base temperature 81 Instead a sudden raise of the magnetic susceptibility below 10 K with field parallel to a-axis resembles the quantum critical behavior of metallic ferromagnets indicating strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuation  This suggests that UTe2 sits at the paramagnetic end of a series of ferromagnetic heavy fermion superconductors as shown in the phase diagram in Fig 2 8 111 At the ferromagnetic end the compound UGe2 is a pressure-induced superconductor with optimal TC  05 K at 12 GPa 1 Moving to the left along the horizontal axis the spin fluctuation increases resulting in the enhancement of TC and the suppression of ferromagnetic long-range order These compounds share the feature of high upper critical field HC2 and strong anisotropy 8 111 indicating the spin-triplet paring state The signatures of spin-triplet Cooper pairing in UTe2 have been found via its very high HC2 a power-law behavior of the electronic specific heat and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate in the SC state and a temperature-independent nuclear magnetic resonance NMR Knight shift across TC  To further confirm the triplet nature a more direct probe on the spin state of the Cooper pairs is required And one way is to measure the spin susceptibility S across TC Upon entering superconducting state the spin susceptibility S of a spin-singlet SC should decrease due to the formation of spinless Cooper pairs TSC on the other hand has spinful Cooper pairs which should contribute to the spin susceptibility as the normal state electrons leaving the spin susceptibility unaffected 1 In fact a small increase in the S could occur for ESP 3He at the superfluid transition due to an insignificant raise of the density of state at Fermi level under external magnetic field but the change is often smaller than instrument resolution 141 Fig 1 Crystal structure of UTe2 Space group Immm 71 Fig 2 Phase diagram of the ferromagnetic heavy fermion SC Fig 3 Picture of the largest piece of single crystal UTe2 sample Polarized neutron scattering can be used to probe the spin susceptibility since the scattering cross section is proportional to 595A5  5  5  55  52 where 595A5 is the nuclear structure factor 5 is the neutron spin polarization vector and 55 is the Fourier components of the magnetization density at momentum transfer 5 To maximize the magnetic contribution the magnetic field has to be perpendicular to the scattering vector 5 When the incoming neutron beam flips its polarization the magnetic contribution flips sign By measuring the neutron cross section with opposite spin polarization the magnetization density and therefore spin susceptibility can be determined from the flipping ratio Measuring polarized neutron scattering on UTe2 across TC can then provide direct evidence on the spin state of the Cooper pairs Choice of Instrument We choose the thermal neutron triple-axis spectrometer BT7 for the proposed experiment for its polarization analysis capability Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We plan to perform polarized neutron scattering on coaligned single crystals of UTe2 The typical size of the crystals is 4 by 25 by 05 mm3 and the total mass is 2 g A small magnetic field will be applied to polarize the spin in the sample and the polarization of the incident neutron need to be perpendicular to the field direction to maximize the spin contribution to the cross section The proposed experiment will follow the same procedure in ref 1 That is to measure the flipping ratio R which is defined as the ratio of cross section for incident neutron spin states which are parallel or antiparallel to the applied magnetic field and with arbitrary scattered neutron spin state When the induced moment is small the flipping ratio gives the magnetization with the following equation 5E  1 255_055555595A5 Recently several groups have reported evidence of temperature-dependent Knight shift across TC in Sr2RuO4 181 questioning the spin-triplet state and the result of Duffy et als work Despite that we believe that the experimental design of Duffy et als work is valid With the fact that UTe2 has larger upper critical field and susceptibility along the easy axis it is feasible to propose this experiment on UTe2 We proposed to apply magnetic field of 1 T along a-axis the axis which shows the largest HC2 and measure the flipping ratio at Bragg position 006 at the following temperature points K 2 16 14 12 10 08 05 TC at 1 T magnetic field is around 14 K  The total request beam time is 7 days References  D M Lee Rev Mod Phys 69 645-665 1997  J Linder  J W A Robinson Nat
