Background Starch is bio-synthesized in granules in seeds roots or tubers etc as primary form of energy storage for plants Starch granule sizes range between 1 to 100 m depending on the plant species Starch molecules consisted of linear chain amylose and branched chain amylopectin arrange themselves in granules in a semi-crystalline fashion Under a polarized microscope Maltese-like crosses see Fig 1a for example resembling spherulites in semi-crystalline high polymers are often observed In addition inside a granule the crystalline and amorphous portion appear in an alternate way as schematically shown in Fig 2b The distances between two crystalline lamellae are in the order of nanometers and can be observed in small-angle scattering profiles manifesting as an interference maximum1 a b Figure 1 Polarized microscopic image of native waxy maize starch a and schematic illustration of lamellar structures inside a starch granule b  The ratio between the content of amylose and amylopectin as well as the crystallinity and crystalline morphology determine not only the texture and taste of starch products but also their digestibility The latter two factors are closely associated with the hydration state of the starch granules In general water has easier access to the amorphous domains hence depending the hydration level the separation between crystal lamellae varies Furthermore starch molecules adopt helix conformation in crystalline phase Helix channels cannot accommodate water molecules as they are largely hydrophobic but water molecules are able to diffuse into unit cell occupying spaces between different helices crystal unit cell can be enlarged accordingly In sum hydration provides us a knob to control starch secondary structures Understanding the structure variation due to hydration level can provide guidelines for manufacturing healthy food in food and nutrition industries We propose to use small-angle neutron scattering SANS to investigate secondary structures of starches from different species including native and modified starches induced by different hydration level The results are expected to help establishing the link between structure processing and product textures SANS experiment methodology and feasibility Starches from different sources will be hydrated using D2O and will be measured using SANS Figure 1 shows preliminary SANS data helped by the local contact of waxy wheat starch Fig 1a and debranched and crystallized waxy potato starch Fig 1b in their dry and hydrated state 50 hydration level After hydration features due to packing of crystalline lamellae are evident For waxy wheat starch due to higher crystallinity the Bragg peak at q 04 1 can also be identified We need to point out that the featureless profiles of starches in their dry state are not due to low contrast between the amorphous and crystalline domains but to the intrinsic disorder of the spatial arrangement of crystalline lamellae This can be verified by examining SAXS profiles of the same samples not shown here Thus SANS is a relevant probe for the proposed studies The advantage of using SANS over SAXS will be discussed in next section when introducing data analysis scheme a b Figure 2 SANS profiles of waxy wheat starch a and debranched and crystallized waxy potato starch b Profiles of both dry and wet 50 hydration level samples are shown Instrumental configurations experiment protocols and data analysis A series of static SANS measurements will be carried out 9-position sample holder can be used for batch measurement heating is not necessary In principle the experiment can be carried out at all the SANS beamlines at the NCNR NIST However we intend to collect in a full 5-range between  0003 to 06 1 Slightly higher 5-range is advantageous as there is a Bragg peak for some starch samples Thus both the NG7-30 m SANS and VSANS beamlines are relevant We prefer NG7-30 m SANS as it is more relevant for a one-day straightforward experiment Standard instrumental configurations with the sample-to-detector distances of 1 m 4 m and 15 m can cover the q-range needed Powder samples will be used Preliminary test suggests that 0-mm cell using 04-mm-thick spacer can accommodate sufficient amount of sample without producing unwanted multiple scattering SANS data analysis is outlined here We expect to observe two types of scattering profiles as shown in Fig 1 For ordered lamellar structures as shown in profiles of hydrated sample in Fig 1a stacking model can be used The fitting parameters are lamellar and amorphous layer thickness and the thickness distributions For less ordered structures showing an intensity transition in intermediate q-range we can try Debye-Bueche model first which is used to analyzing two-phase system A correlation length characterizing statistic average of size of crystalline and amorphous domains will be obtained For SANS experiment measuring absolute intensity is a common practice It provides an opportunity to interpret the pre-factors of the fitting models For stacking model this pre-factor is associated with the average height of stacks for Debye-Bueche model information about surface area might be available depending on how accurately the percentage of each phase and the scattering length density can be obtained we might need to combine SANS data with WAXS results Samples and beamtime request Ten different types of starches waxy maize normal maize waxy potato waxy wheat high-amylose maize starches and their debranched and crystallized samples at three different hydration levels namely dry 25 and 50 will be measured This leads to 30 measurements Preliminary data collected at the VSANS beamline require 25 min for each measurement Considering that the neutron flux at the NG7-30m SANS is lower we expect to spend 40 min for each measurement Thus 20 h are needed to complete this set of experiment Adding time spent on instrument alignment background measurements and sample change we request 1 day of beamtime at the NG7-30 m SANS beamline Reference  Bai Y Cai L Doutch J Gilbert E P  Shi Y C 2014 Structural changes
