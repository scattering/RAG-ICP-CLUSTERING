 Page 1 of 3 NIST Proposal No 27027 Water Seepage into an Internal Crack of Porous Ceramic-Matrix Composite CMC Panel Material The purpose of this study is to use neutron imaging to visually examine an internal crack of a Ceramic Matrix Composite CMC which is developed as a result of thermal expansion mismatching between the ceramic matrix SiC and the fibrous carbon C filler materials during the sintering process Fig 1 When the CSiC is used as a refractory material for reusable hypersonic flight vehicles its micro-cracked and porous-like structure allows water to penetrate and to freeze in the cold resulting in disastrous growth of the internal crack Detailed characterization of the crack and the dynamic water penetration into the crack may lead to improvement of the CSiC synthesis process as well as facilitate its evaluation as a critical high temperature material Scientific Importance With the rise of rivaling adversaries around the world many national security policy documents such as the OMB-OSTP memorandum of 2016 and the NDAA of 2015 have identified the development of hypersonic capabilities as a national research priority However with the US Air Force planning to develop reusable hypersonic flight vehicles in existing programs such as HyREV Hypersonic Reusable Vehicle the barrier to that frontier lies in material science There has not yet been a material reliably developed and tested that can withstand the aerothermodynamic loads of hypersonic flight while maintaining its structural integrity for reuse Under the auspices of WPAFBDOD the PIs group has studied heat-pipe cooled leading edge HPCLE devices which redistribute the aerothermodynamic loads and performed neutron imaging of lithium Li coolant behaviors inside a niobium Nb heat pipe over the last several years at NIST Fig 2 and Refs 1-4 To enhance the reliability of hypersonic thermal management the Air Forces research focus has recently been directed toward the exploration of the use of CMC as a refractory material for reusable hypersonic flight vehicles These CMC materials utilize a woven carbon fiber as filler to increase strength and structural resiliency while taking advantage of the high-temperature performance of SiC as a matrix material Fig 3 For example in CFM Internationals LEAP Engine CMCs have already shown their utility in high temperature aerospace applications CMCs have replaced the LEAP Engines metal parts due to their low density 313 gcm3 and low thermal conductivity less than 20 WmK A CSiC panel specific to a hypersonic leading-edge structure is currently being synthesized and developed at the University of Dayton Research Institute UDRI by the PIs main collaborator under the supervision of the Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL at WPAFB The provided CSiC samples have been preliminarily tested at the PIs laboratory at the University of Tennessee using fluorescence imaging which is limited in that it can only detect the surface crack Neutron imaging of the sample material with its inherent internal crack will provide us with an unparalleled perspective into the inner structural assessment of the CSiC material to evaluate its potential viability in hypersonic aerospace systems The cracks of the sample will be saturated with water ethanol may be added to promote penetration yielding an ideal contrast for neutron imaging based on waters relatively high neutron attenuation 10770 cm-1 over both the fibrous carbon 0000 cm-1 and the ceramic matrix materials Si 0006 cm-1 Al 0009 cm-1 N 0183 cm-1 Fig 2 Neutron image recorded previously at NIST for the Nb-Li heat-pipe under extreme heating to simulate hypersonic flight conditions Ref 2 Ceramic Filler Carbon Fibers Fig 1 A Ceramic Matrix Composite CMC with fibrous carbon fillers Ref 1 Fig 3 Schematic representation of internal cracks due to the thermal expansion mismatching between the carbon fiber and the ceramic matrix in CMC Page 2 of 3 Preliminary Work The PIs lab has been able to implement a special fluorescence imaging technique that can identify superficial surface cracks which are shown by bright blue fluorescent emissions Fig 4 In contrast the carbon areas are dark since the carbon atoms almost completely quench the fluorescent emission A small drop of DAPI fluorescent dye was dropped on one side of the CSiC panel and the sequential images were taken from the other side of the panel showing a progressive penetration of the dye solution through the internal micro- or submicro-scale cracks While the fluorescent quenching visualization can only reveal superficial imperfections by surface cracks neutron tomography will make possible a comprehensive mapping of internal crack structures The PIs lab is also testing different ways of introducing thermal and mechanical stresses to the CSiC panel for comparative neutron imaging of different types of cracks developed in the panel Choice of Instrument We have chosen the BT2 NIF Neutron Imaging Facility which provides outstanding computed tomography capabilities and well accommodates our proposed need for comprehensive internal crack development analysis The PI has also established long-term research collaborative activities with Dr David Jacobson who is the NIST representative for the NIF Experiment Plan First the PIs team at the University of Tennessee Knoxville UTK will conduct a preliminary study for surface cracks of the CMC sample materials from UDRI These surface cracks will then be identified by the carbon-quenching fluorescence imaging and inspected to see if they have penetrated inside the CMC from observation of the capillary action of the fluorescence fluid smearing into the cracks Our NIST experiment plan consists of three main tasks 1 Feasibility of neutron imaging for micro-cracks inside a CSiC panel sample will be tested primarily for the neutron imaging resolution compatibility A confirmation test will also be conducted to ensure that large neutron cross-sections of water will create a distinctive shadow over carbon and a ceramic background that should be dim because of their near-zero neutron cross-sections 2 Dynamic imaging of water penetration will be recorded for a similar CSiC sample with internal cracks through the remotely-controlled dropping of water droplets onto the sample surface allowing the water to be pulled into the crack capillaries progressively with neutron imaging 3 Tomographic imaging of the cracks will be conducted to examine the full three-dimensional internal crack structures for various types of CSiC sample materials that are associated with different sintering processes The sample will be thoroughly soaked in water beforehand to fill the cracks with water and then the sample will be wrapped with aluminum foil to minimize any evaporation during the lengthy tomographic data taking period For the completion of these tasks we ask for 72 hours of beam time preferably allocated during the UTK Spring Break week March 18-22 2019 because two UGRA students will be participating in the experiments with my supervision If this week is unavailable we would prefer scheduling over any weekend for minimum class absence t  1 s 2 s 3 s 3 s 5 s 8 s 18 s Fig 4 Progressive penetration of DAPI fluorescent dye through internal cracks to appear on the surface of a CSiC panel sample after the DAPI solution was dropped on the opposite side of the sample Page 3 of 3 Safety Considerations No safety concern is noted in conducting the proposed experiments using amorphous CSiC samples with aqueous solution In order to improve the water wettingpenetration ethanol can be added to help lower the surface tension however such a small amount of ethanol will not cause any concerns beyond the general lab chemical safety protocol References 1 httpswwwcompositesworldcomarticlesceramic-matrix-composites-heat-up 2 K D Kihm B Hight E Kirchoff H Yi J Rosenfeld S Rawal D Hussey D Jacobson H Bilheux L
