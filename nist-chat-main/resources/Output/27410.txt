Investigation of low-temperature incommensurate magnetic structure in mixed Ba2Cu1-xMnxGe2O7 multiferroic melilites Introduction Appearance of ferroelectricity in many members of the kermanite family Ba2XGe2O7 X  Cu Co Mn below the magnetic ordering temperature was recently discovered  This field-induced ferroelectric polarization is strongly coupled to the magnetic order which depends clearly on the selected transition metal ion For Ba2CoGe2O7 S32 the spins are ordered antiferromagnetic in the ab plane and ferromagnetic along the c-axis 2  Due to the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya Interaction DMI which is allowed by the non-centrosymmetric nuclear space group P-421m of this family the spins are slightly canted leading to a weak ferromagnetic moment For Ba2MnGe2O7 S52 the spins are not only ordered antiferromagnetic in the ab plane but also along the c-axis  Thus the magnetic unit cell is doubled in the c direction Ba2CuGe2O7 S12 in contrast forms an incommensurate almost AF cycloidal spin structure making it to one of the rare materials where spiral spin textures and weak ferromagnetism are predicted to coexist 5  Moreover it was suggested by theory that Ba2CuGe2O7 could support a stable skyrmion phase  However this phase which should be similar to those of the B20 compounds has not been observed so far Since the adopted magnetic order depends mainly on the nature of the transition metal ion it is extremely interesting to clear how these mechanism interplay in mixed compounds of Ba2X1-xYxGe2O7 type X Y  Cu Co Mn Such mixed melilite oxides could help us to understand and compare the competing mechanism within the kermanite family but also could emerge some new and interesting ferroelectricmultiferroic properties Previous results Recently Granata et al  succeeded to synthesize for the first time mixed melilite-type oxide of Ba2Cu1xMnxGe2O7 and provided us polycrystalline samples with different x-values for further investigations By room temperature X-ray diffraction we could confirm their tetragonal structure and good quality In heat capacity HC measurements we observed a different linear behavior of the transition temperature for the Mn rich and Cu rich Figure 1 Phase transition temperature in polycrystalline Ba2Cu1-xCoxGe2O7 as observed by heat capacity measurements dependent on the doping x There is a different behavior observed for the Mn and Cu rich sides Figure 2 Appearance of the commensurate 100 reflection with two incommensurate satellites by cooling to 15 K compositions as shown in Fig 1 However for the intermediate doping levels x  050 and 063 no clear phase transition could be observed by HC down to 04 K Very recently by neutron powder diffraction at low temperature of 15 K we observed the appearance of magnetic reflections for the intermediate compositions For all Mn rich compositions x  063 magnetic reflections with k  0 0  which are characteristic for pure Ba2MnGe2O7 was evidenced For the Cu rich compositions these k-vector reflections have not been observed at 15 K but a new commensurate magnetic 100 reflection is present accompanied by two incommensurate satellites see Fig 2 for x  050 Those peaks disappear by heating to 10 K The new phase might be similar to the AF-cone phase observed in pure Ba2CuGe2O7 single crystals  by application of a moderate magnetic field around 23 T along the c-axis These new low temperature reflections were most prominent in the x  050 compound and lost intensity for decreasing x-values For x  010 they are still present but barely visible For the x  005 and 000 compounds we could not identify them anymore Aim of proposed work By means of high resolution neutron powder diffraction at BT-7 we want to study thermal and magnetic evolution of the new incommensurate magnetic structure in the Cu-rich compounds of the mixed Ba2Cu1-xMnxGe2O7 solid-solution line and determine their order parameters This will help us to understand the mechanisms forming the individual magnetic orders in dependency on the selected transition metal ion and their interplay with the unconventional magneto-electric properties observed in the melilte-type germanites This experiment is a continuation of proposal 26303 and will be part of the PhD thesis of Mr Henrik Thoma Proposed experiments We plan to measure four mixed compounds x  000 010 025 05 with expected magnetic transition temperatures below 2 K which are not easily reachable with standard cryostat setups In order to study the appearance of the incommensurate magnetic structure in the Ba2Cu1-xMnxGe2O7 polycrystalline samples we propose detailed temperature scans of the incommensurate magnetic peaks from around 5 K above magnetic transition to 05 K or lowest possible using 3He insert below magnetic transition in order to determine precisely the transition temperatures and critical ordering parameters Furthermore by magnetic field scans of the incommensurate peak at fixed temperature we want to investigate the stability of this magnetic structure Since for single crystalline Ba2CuGe2O7 fields up to 9 T are necessary to break the incommensurate structure  a high field magnet is required Thus we ask in total for 6 days at BT-7 including time for the sample change and the cooling down process References  H Murakava et al Phys Rev B 85 174106 2012  V Hutanu et al Phys Rev B 86 104401 2012  V Hutanu et al
