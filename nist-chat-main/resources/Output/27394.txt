 Reference state of random mixing in amyloid fibrils structures Scientific background Alzheimer disease is the most common form of neurodegeneration in which the brain is damaged by accumulation of insoluble fibrillary deposits as a consequence of secretases cleavage of APP protein to pathogenic Amyloid- polypeptides The formation of those aggregates involves mainly the misfolding of two specific alloforms of Amyloid- polypeptides A40 and A42 These two peptides only differ by two amino acids in the C-terminal region yet previous studies in vitro showed that the assembly into fibrillar structures might be highly specific  Indeed different aggregation behaviour has been observed between A42 and A40 or between A42 and A42 mutant where the N-terminus domain is extended by 15 amino acids Previous studies on the aggregation mechanism of Amyloid- alloforms by ThT fluorescence assays reveal that A40 and A4215NTE mutant respectively have lower aggregation propensity then A42 but A4215NTE mutant favourite the cross-seeding and co-aggregation with A42  Surprisingly A42 and A4215NTE mutant seem to co-assemble to form heterogeneous aggregates while A40 and A42 peptides self-assemble into separate homomolecular fibrils  The origins of these differences have remained challenging to connect to specific molecular interactions By studying the binary mixture of different alloforms of Amyloid- in protonated and deuterated states we aim to define by using Small-Angles Neutron Scattering coupled to solid state NMR  the high resolution structure of Amyloid fibrils Preliminary results In figure 1 we show our recent findings on A42 fibrils cross-section of 68nm in the major axis and 17nm in the minor axis obtained by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Figure1 Blue dots Experimental SANS profile of A42 in 100D2O pH 74  Cyan line Elliptical cylinder model fit of Amyloid-42 Fibril Proposed experiments We will study the possible binary co-assembly of relevant A proteins by choosing a particular H2OD20 ratio in the buffer The D2OH20 ratio will represents the average scattering length density of the two proteins chosen for the binary sample thus matching the case of randomly mixed fibril We will focus mainly on two different mixed system i d- A42h-A40 and ii d-A42h-A4215NTE-mutant A42 will be fully deuterated and we will investigate the possible co-assembly with protonated A40 or A4215NTE -mutant In the case of complete segregation ie no mixing at all significant scattering is expected while complete mixing will lead to an almost vanishing scattering at lower q-values ideally I00 In fact a finite value of I0 will allow us to estimate any variation in the fibril compositions around 5050 while at higher q-values we are expected to the see the characteristic length scale of the scattering length density variation within the fibrils from the distribution of deuterated and protonated species In the case of a complete random mixing within the fibrils the characteristic length scale should be of the size of the folded protein in a fibril ie a few nm We expect to record a structure factor peak reporting on that length scale In addition we will record the scattering of pure d-A42 h-A40 and h- A4215NTE-mutant in the particular H20D20 buffer as references of the potentially purely segregated states ie no co-assembly Finally we will also study a mixture of d- A42 and h-A42 where random co-assembly of course is expected The objective of this experiment is to record the characteristic length scale of the variation of scattering length density within these fibrils again as another reference for the internal fibril structure In total we will measure 7 samples each of them over the full q-range 00009 -1 - 06 -1 of the 30 m SANS instrument using 4 different settings The scattering length density difference between individual peptide and solvent H2OD2O3070 will now be of the order of - 2 10-6 -2 Based on previous our experiments involving fully protonated protein in D2O where a total of 2 h per sample were used we estimate that we here will need ca 4 times longer exposure times ca 8 h for the same signal-to-noise in the case of fully segregated assembly ie no co-assembly and for the same protein concentrations In the case of co-assembly being contrast matched we may need even longer exposure times if we want to have good statistics at lower q Experiments will be performed on absolute scale which means that transmission backgrounds and calibrations also have to be measured With these measurements together with 7 samples each 8 h we estimate that we need 3 full days of beamtime on the NGB30 instrument to complete everything References 1 PNAS July 1 2014 111 26 9384-9389 2 JAmChemSoc 2015 13746 14673-14685 3 Chem Sci 20156 4215 4 J Am Chem Soc 2016 138 30 9663-9674
