Probing water at the catalystionomer interface of gas-fed electrochemical cells under in-operando conditions Introduction Polymer electrolyte PE based low-temperature electrochemical devices such as hydrogen fuel cells water electrolyzers and CO2-to-fuel electrochemical reactors are leading the clean energy technology revolution Electrochemical reactions in these devices occur at the surface of catalyst interfacing with ion-conducting polymer or ionomer eg Nafion Interfacial water at this electrochemical catalystionomer interface plays a vital role in controlling the electrochemical performance of these devices Pioneering neutron reflectometry NR work by NIST and ORNL researchers revealed few Angstroms of interfacial water for SiO2Nafion PtNafion AuNafion systems 1- Recent work by applicants show that the thickness of water at Ptionomer interface is dependent on the ionomer molecular structure specifically its side-chain length  However none of these studies were performed under in-operando conditions which may result in drastically different interfacial water contents For example in a fuel cell the in operando PtNafion interface would generate water via oxygen reduction reaction ORR If not efficiently removed the accumulated water would affect the interfacial pH and also impede the local transport of reactants Both of these affect the electrochemical reaction rate Although the interfacial water content was not known in recent studies variation in the external hydration level demonstrably affected the electrochemical activity and gas diffusivity through the ionomer thin film 5- The water content in the ionomer and at the catalystionomer interface is dependent on external relative humidity RH A direct probing of the interfacial water at this critically important catalystionomer interface under in-operando conditions is considered a grand challenge and if successfully attained will have immense scientific impact and will also be of direct technological value Prior Work and Research Gap Only a handful of studies all using neutron reflectometry NR have examined the interfacial water at electrochemically relevant interfaces ie NafionPt and NafionAu At high relative humidity above 90 RH a water rich interfacial layer between Pt and ionomer was observed 1- The amount of interfacial water will control the interfacial pH and thereby the electrode kinetics Surprisingly the scientific community has not even posited this idea of how the interfacial pH could change in operando Furthermore two opposing views of how interfacial water affects the local O2 transport a grave problem - see Ref  has been put forth from two separate MD studies 8- Without a knowledge of how the interfacial water content changes from non-active but under humidified to in-operando conditions the scientific community is merely speculating whether Ptionomer interfacial resistance is responsible for the unknown local O2 transport resistance  We propose to address these knowledge gaps using neutron reflectometry to study the interfacial water and distribution of water within the bulk ionomer thin film on Pt under in-operando condition Neutron reflectometry has been implemented to study the catalyst surfaces in a liquid electrolyte system 1 but never been applied to study ionomer-catalyst interface in a gas fed electrochemical cell where humidity is the only source of water to hydrate the ionomer Figure 1 Examples depicting Catalyst-ionomer interface in fuel cell and CO2 electrolyzer A key challenge is the designconfiguration of the electrochemical cell that satisfies two key functionalities i accessibility of the catalytic interface by the neutrons through the hardware without much interference ii sustain the desired electrochemical reaction at the probed interface under controlled chemical environment humidity and reactant concentration to generate constant electrical current Objective Our goal is to probe the interfacial water at the catalyst-ionomer interface under in-operando conditions as well as to study the evolution of ionomer structure during an electrochemical reaction Planar Pt substrate coated with 15nm ionomer film serves as a model system wherein oxygen reduction reaction ORR is carried out in specially designed electrochemical cell Electrochemical cell design We have engaged in an extensive discussion with the beamline scientist Dr Joseph Dura at NIST USA and Dr Helmut Fritzsche scientist at CNL Canada to design a functional electrochemical cell compatible with Neutron Reflectometry Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the newly developed electrochemical cell For the shown configuration the ORR reaction occurs at the interface of interest ie PtNafion interface and oxygen evolution reaction OER occurs at the counter electrode For the NR measurement both electrodes will be exposed to humidified oxygen or air supplied through an external system available at NIST The porous ionomer layer ensures transport of protons between the ORR and OER electrodes its porous nature allows the transport of oxygen and water vapor from the OER electrode side to the ORR electrode During electrochemical operation ie when current is being generated protons electrons and oxygen meet at the Pt-Nafion interface where ORR occurs and water is generated The porous ionomer layer is designed to be a very low SLD  01 material to avoid interference with the reflectivity from the sample Test of concept The electrochemical functionality of the cell has been established results are shown in Figure-3 The cell was held at a constant current density of 10 mAcmPt2 equivalent to 1 Amperes per cm2 of electrode area in a 04 mgcm2 cathode catalyst layer of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell for 16 hours sufficiently long to complete the necessary neutron reflectometry measurements During electric current generation or water production it is expected that the accumulation of water at Pt-Nafion thin film interface and within the ionomer will produce much different interfacial and hydrated ionomer structure than those for ionomer film on Pt exposed to humid air To assess the likelihood of measuring the changes due to the water production we simulated a reflectivity profile by considering a model of a water rich layer at Pt-ionomer interface see Figure-4 There is a clear distinction in the reflectivity profile with different water layer thicknesses importantly these differences are measurable below Q  015 Figure 2 Newly developed electrochemical cell for studying ionomer structure during ORR Figure 3 Long-term 16 hours constant current 10 mAcm2 operation of the newly developed electrochemical cell at 30 oC 85 RH in air Inset shows linear sweep voltammogram of the same cell 30 oC 85 RH air Figure 2 Simulated reflectivity profile for three thicknesses 0 A or no water 6 Aand 12 A  of water at Pt-Nafion interface Proposed Plan The proposed plan requests 9 days of beam time to perform a series of measurements where NR response of the system is collected as each additional component of the electrochemical cell is added to the base substrate ionomerPtTiSiO2 -
