INS study of interlayer exchange interactions in NiII square lattices We are focused on the design and syntheses of novel molecular and polymeric architectures with magnetic interactions governed by organic and hydrogen bond pathways To do this we are using simple combinations of transition metal cations eg Ni2 anions such as HF2- and halides F Cl Br and I and pyrazine pyz These efforts have afforded many new compounds based on Q2D Nipyz2 square topologies for which we can readily vary the axial ligands and tune the magnetic ground state according to the single-ion anisotropy D1-3 Ultimately our goal is to control the intra- Jpyz and interlayer J magnetic coupling such that phase diagrams can be traversed and materials placed in close proximity to quantum critical points QCPs In addition it is possible to cross phase boundaries wherein new phases may arise under application of pressure magnetic field andor chemical doping Recent successes using DCS to determine D and J parameters NiHF2pyzSbF6 pyz  pyrazine The material has a tetragonal network structure made up of Ni-FHF-Ni chains that run along the c-axis which are linked in the ab-plane by pyz bridges Fig 1a According to DFT the magnetic interaction along the Ni-FHF-Ni chains JFHF is much stronger than along Ni-pyz-Ni Jpyz1 The resulting structure affords spatial exchange anisotropy SbF6- ions needed for charge neutrality occupy interstitial sites and may contribute an additional although extremely weak magnetic pathway Figure 1 a Zero-field magnetic structure of NiHF2pyzSbF6 with SbF6- anions omitted for clarity b Background subtracted INS spectrum measured on DCS The solid black lines are those of the simulated INS spectrum using SpinW We recently measured T-dependent INS spectra of a deuterated sample of NiHF2pyzSbF6 using the DCS at the NCNR Fig 1c4 Figure 1a shows the background subtracted INS spectrum measured at T  16 K An upper bound of the spectrum appears at approximately 33 meV The T-dependence indicates that this feature is likely associated with the transition to magnetic long-range order owing to spin wave formation Collectively the energy scale wave-vector and temperature-dependence of the scattering below 1 meV indicates that acoustic phonons contribute to the scattering intensity at these lower energies A small percentage of hydrogen in the sample due to incomplete deuteration ie result of HF2- could cause this large background due to the large incoherent cross-section of the 1H-isotope For T  TN magnetic Bragg peaks are evident from diffraction patterns obtained from the WISH diffractometer at ISIS Here we learned that the zero-field magnetic structure consists of XY-ordered NiII magnetic moments lying in the ab-plane which concurs with D  04 For the magnetically ordered phase at T  16 K we modeled the zero-field spectrum using the numerical spin wave calculation package SpinW5 We chose the XY magnetic structure determined from the zero-field neutron diffraction measurements Exchange interactions JFHF and Jpyz as well as the anisotropy term D were used in the Hamiltonian Using thermodynamically derived parameters as a starting point we calculated the powder average spin-wave spectrum for energy transfers between 2 and 4 meV and compared this to background subtracted data The reduced fitting range was used to avoid the low energy phononic region described above Additional fit a b Ni N C F H parameters included an overall multiplicative prefactor to scale the calculated scattering intensity and a constant background Figure 1c also shows an overlay of the experimental and fitted spectra The resulting terms in the Hamiltonian were determined to be JFHF  0893 meV  104 K Jpyz  0122 meV  14 K and D  1129 meV  13 K with J  0 being attributed to AFM spin interactions4 Therefore Ni-FHF-Ni is a much more effective magnetic exchange mediator than Ni-pyz-Ni NiCl2pyz2 This compound has a tetragonal structure similar to that of NiHF2pyzSbF6 but with Cl- replacing HF2-3 As intended identical 2D Nipyz2 square lattices are replicated however the Cl- serve as non-bridging axial ligands By decoupling the 2D layers we can directly probe the strength of the intralayer Ni-pyz-Ni magnetic interaction as well as the electronic perturbation to the NiII center From heat capacity and INS on a powder sample D  78 K In applied magnetic fields of 3-75 T a weak peak in CmagT appears near 1 K but it is not clear if this is due to a field-induced LRO The broadening of CmagT with increasing field and its shifting to higher temperatures are typical of a Schottky anomaly due to single-ion excitations Zero-field neutron powder diffraction data obtained on BT-1 and WISH ISIS do not show any evidence for LRO down to at least 05 K Theory predicts that at DJ  56 a transition from an XY-AFM to quantum paramagnet QPM occurs6 With DJ 15 this seems consistent for NiCl2pyz2 although it remains unclear whether a magnetic field could induce LRO Figures 2a and b shows the measured scattering intensity at T  16 and T  50 K respectively The low temperature measurement shows a band of excitations that extends to approximately 08 meV in energy transfer  At higher temperatures this band of excitations becomes very diffuse and some of the scattering intensity appears on the negative energy transfer side of the spectrum consistent with detailed balance of magnetic excitations Figure 2c shows the difference of the high and low temperature measurements for the range of energy and wave-vector transfer Q which will be used to compare to different spin-wave theory calculations Here one can also see the decrease in scattering intensity as a function of Q further illustrating that the excitations are magnetic in origin No transition to long-range magnetic order was observed in these measurements Although our measurements are not in an ordered magnetic phase we chose to approximate the magnetic excitations using linear spin-wave theory LSWT This is a reasonable approximation for the low temperature measurement given the moment of the spin Considering similar structures and the thermodynamic measurements of the current material3 we assume that the exchange interactions are Heisenberg and AFM in nature with a magnetic structure that has the ordered S  1 moments pointing along the a-axis We consider Ni moments along the a- b- c- and 111 axes to be AFM aligned An in-plane single ion anisotropy D and exchange along the a- and b- axis Ja  Jb  Jnn was included in the spin-wave calculation We found that the data did not support refinement of additional exchange interactions We compared our LSWT model5 to the difference in the high temperature and low-temperature in the range of wave-vector and energy transfer shown in Fig 2c This range of data avoids potential influence from the elastic scattering and any potential acoustic phonon scattering Thermodynamic measurements predicted the ratio of DJnn to be approximately 10 Figure 2 Inelastic neutron scattering intensity as a function of energy and wave-vector transfer a T  16 K measurement b T  50 K measurement c Difference in T  16 K and T  50 K data d Calculated spin-wave spectrum as discussed in the text The intensity of panels c and d are shown as twice the actual measuredcalculated intensity We compared our LSWT model to the measured data for a range of D and Jnn values using a spherical approximation to the Ni2 form-factor This determined the values to be D  070 - 008 meV and Jnn  007 - 001 meV The corresponding calculated spin-wave spectrum is shown in Fig 2d and is shown to agree well with the measured data shown with and without the high temperature background subtraction in Fig 2c and d respectively The wave-vectors at which the minima occur in the calculated spin-wave spectrum agree well with the locations of the minima in the measured spectra namely in the vicinity of Q07 and 14 -1 If the material had experienced long-range magnetic order this would correspond to the antiferromagnetic wave-vectors This similarity lends further support to the proposed AFM model of spin correlations Proposed INS study 1 NiI2pyz2 is isostructural to the aforementioned Cl-compound From ESR and heat capacity measurements D  0 and TN  25 K3 The fact that LRO occurs suggests a small DJ ratio Experimental data in hand indicate that the single-ion gap D may follow the same trend as crystal-field splitting energy predicted by the spectrochemical series ie I-  Br-  Cl-  F-  HF2- for the NiX2pyz2 series INS data on sister compounds would help confirm this While the interlayer interaction J is small for X  Cl and Br thermodynamic data for X  I suggest that Jpyz  J despite the larger interlayer separation in NiI2pyz2 As a result the underlying physics of the material may be very different and warrants further study on DCS to directly determine Jpyz and J Furthermore pulsed-field MH data show a possible spin-flop-like transition near 35 T which argues D  0 based on analyses of related systems From measurement of the magnetic excitation spectrum we aim to determine Jpyz J and D for NiI2pyz2 Its spectra will also be compared to those obtained for the Cl and Br analogs 2 NiF2pyz2 has a 2D square lattice akin to NiI2pyz2 but crystallizes in a monoclinic space group7 Because of the reduced symmetry the N-Ni-N bond angles are distorted from the ideal 90 bond angles to about 88 The Ni-NN bridge is also distorted with an angle of 177 and we speculate that it should lead to a reduced Jpyz as compared to structures where that bridge angle is perfectly linear as in the other NiX2pyz2 members and NiHF2pyzSbF6 Like the Ni-HF2 compound which shares the same NiN4F2 environment we expect a large positive-D value such that DJ  1 and D should be larger than that found in NiCl2pyz2 However this material exhibits long-range magnetic order below 235 K according to SQUID and heat capacity data Proposed experiments From recent successes in measuring the spin excitations in several NiII compounds we ask for a total of four days of beamtime on DCS two dayssample to perform INS measurements on 2-g samples of NiI2pyz2 and NiF2pyz2 The expected energy scale of spin excitations should be less than 2 meV thus neutrons with a wavelength of 37  or 48  should be adequate and still provide good flux at the sample position NiI2pyz2 has a TN just above the 15 K base-T attainable in a standard orange cryostat so the low-T insert may also be needed We will measure the powder average magnetic excitation spectra above and below the suspected TNs and compare the results to an appropriate model Hamiltonian to determine the prevalent excitations in each material Spin wave spectra will be modeled using the Spin-W program5 This has proven to be an effective tool to simulate INS data of powder samples48 References  J L Manson et al Inorg Chem 2011 50 5990  J L Manson et al Dalton Trans 2012 41 7235  J Liu et al Inorg
