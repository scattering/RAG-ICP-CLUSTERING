 1 Understanding the interactions of ceramic particles in aqueous suspension and external AC electric field employing ultra small-angle neutron scattering USANS technique 1 Scientific Background and Anticipated Impact This proposal aims to employ the ultra small-angle neutron scattering USANS technique to understand the interactions between ultrafine 300 nm ceramic particles suspended in deionized DI water and alternating current AC electric field Understanding the interactions would enable us to employ an AC electric field in colloidal processing of ceramics for particle motion redistribution and assembly to result in the novel synthesis of materials and structures Alumina Al2O3 ceramic is utilized here as a model material system and the methodology is equally applicable to other oxide and non-oxide ceramics as well Upon application of an AC electric field dielectrophoretic DEP forces are generated in an aqueous suspension containing charged particles 1 The DEP phenomenon is the motion of a particle caused by frequency-dependent polarization effects in a nonuniform electric field Particles experience DEP force only in a non-uniform electric field and the DEP force does not depend on the field polarity When the AC field is applied between two parallel electrodes of the same size the electric field around ceramic particles in aqueous suspension is spatially non-uniform due to the perturbation of the electric field caused by the particles and individual particles in proximity induce spatially non-uniform electric field around each other resulting in mutual DEP forces on these particles  The biggest energy gain is realized when the particles align in chains along the direction of the field lines as schematically shown in Fig 1  The chaining force acting on the particles is always attractive And particles of the same type always align along the field lines regardless of whether their polarizability is greater or smaller than the media This proposal is strongly motivated by our preliminary studies in which we applied AC electric field to aqueous suspensions of Al2O3 which was followed by unidirectional solidification of the suspensions freeze-drying sublimation and sintering The bottom regions of the sintered samples were characterized primarily for the evidence of field-induced settling of particles Figure 2 shows scanning electron microscope SEM images of the bottom regions of the sintered samples for different field durations initial applied peak-to-peak voltage Vpp  195 V and frequency  1 MHz and of the control sample where no field was applied  During the unidirectional solidification process a thin and relatively dense layer of ceramic particles develops at the bottom and above that layer templated structure develops Fig 2a Note that the formation of a thin dense layer at the bottom of the control sample is not associated with particle settling but rather than a result of the solidification process itself  When the AC field was applied a relatively thick dense layer developed Fig 2b and the thickness of the layer at the bottom increased with the duration of the field Fig 2c We attribute the increased layer thickness to the field-induced settling of particles Our hypothesis is that as an AC electric field is applied to ceramic suspension field-induced DEP forces cause motion and agglomeration of ceramic particles Agglomerated particles would settle resulting in the formation of a layer of particles at the bottom of greater thickness compared to the control Figure 1 A schematic representation of particle chain formation through DEP forces ACFDEPFDEPFigure 2 SEM images of sintered Al2O3 a no AC field and field duration b 14 and c 35 minutes Applied Vpp  195 V and frequency 1 MHz  2 sample ie no field With the increasing duration of the field the extent of particles settling would also increase and hence the layer thickness During field application we also measured the changes in voltage Vpp across the suspension with time Since ceramic suspensions are opaque settling of particles could not be observed but voltage measurement provides some insight Figure 3 shows the variation of voltage at a frequency of 1 MHz with time for different initial applied voltage ie Vpp at t  0  The measurements were performed for Al2O3 suspensions of 18 vol solids loading For each initial applied voltage Vpp first decreased with time and then reached saturation however greater the initial applied Vpp sooner the saturation stage arrived The continuous change in voltage could be attributed to the simultaneous changes of permittivity and conductivity of suspension with time due to particle motion agglomeration and settling Whereas saturation in voltage suggests that no more particle settling for that experimental condition Our hypothesis is that the greater the magnitude of the initially applied Vpp the higher was the magnitude of the DEP forces and as a result saturation stage was achieved earlier The preliminary results are very exciting and provide some insight However to decipher the exact mechanism of particle settling employing the USANS technique we aim to directly probe into the field-induced motion and agglomeration of ceramic particles in an aqueous medium The USANS technique can probe into bulk average structures in a concentrated colloidal particle suspensiondispersion and suitable for characterizing features in the size regime of 01 - 20 m In a stable ceramic suspension particles will be initially randomly dispersed however as the distribution of particles changes due to an external AC electric field the change will affect scattering intensity The magnitude of DEP forces depends on several factors such as permittivity and conductivity of materials concentration of particles particle size and AC electric field parameters voltage frequency duration An increase in the magnitude of DEP forces will cause greater polarization of particles which can result in faster motion of particles and possibly the formation of a greater number of agglomerates andor larger agglomerates Employing USANS we anticipate to be able to capture the changes as a function of different variables The DEP forces that develop in an aqueous ceramic suspension can be estimated using analytical and computational approaches and investigators are working on developing models The experimental measurements would allow us to build quantitative relationships with model predictions which is necessary to understand the fundamentals of the proposed methodology The combination of the DEP phenomenon and particle chaining can be used as a facile tool for the directed colloidal assembly of microscopic ceramic structures Therefore the fundamental understanding from the proposed experiments would enable us to employ the dielectrophoretic assembly of colloidal particles for novel microstructural organization and synthesizing new materials 2 Experimental Details Aqueous ceramic suspensions will be prepared by mixing a commercially available ultrafine Al2O3 powder with a narrow size distribution d10  210 m d50  300 m d90  410 m in DI water A small amount of dispersant will be added for the uniform dispersion of particles and the suspensions will be ball milled prior to the experiments Figure 4 shows a schematic of the quartz mold wall thickness 4 mm with metal electrodes and containing ceramic suspension In the beam direction the thickness of the suspension is 1 mm USANS experiments will be performed with an AC electric field applied to ceramic suspension ElectrodV25 mm25 mm 1 mmFigure 4 Quartz mold containing suspension Figure 3 Variation of Vpp with time 90 125 and 150 are initial applied peak-to-peak voltages  3 In the proposed experiments we seek to specifically investigate in situ the effects of i solids loading ie ceramic content of suspension ii applied voltage iii frequency and iv field duration The selection of the parameters is based on the results of our preliminary studies where post characterization of the sintered samples revealed evidence of field-induced settling of particles and effects of the variables on the extent of settling During each experiment voltage change across the suspension will be measured and the experiment will be continued until the measured voltage saturates Based on the data shown in Fig 3 during the continuous application of AC electric field saturation stage was reached within 15 minutes Therefore once the setup for each USANS experiment is done each experiment can be completed within a short duration Table 1 shows the proposed set of experiments and the parameters for each experiment For an applied AC electric field the DEP effects are expected to enhance with the increasing solids loading in an aqueous medium because a higher concentration of ceramic particles will result in a greater perturbation of the field and increase the magnitude of the mutual DEP forces We will utilize two compositions which are 18 vol and 26 vol Al2O3 in DI water Similarly the applied initial voltage will be systematically varied in the range of 50-200 V and the measurements will be conducted at frequencies of 05 and 1 MHz 3 Run Times We are requesting 3 days for the proposed experiments This will be the first time the investigators will be conducting these experiments at NCNR Thus the requested beam time is based on the data showed in Fig 3 We expect that in 3 days we will be able to conduct several experiments and vary the parameters systematically which would allow us to generate sufficient data to understand the proposed methodology If the proposed experiments are completed in less than 3 days we will conduct some additional experiments for other frequencies 4 Anticipated Method of Data Analysis Data analysis will involve two projections of the anisotropic scattering ie tangential and radial to resolve the changes in the suspensions  The ODU investigators will work closely with the NC State collaborator who has significant experience in SANS and in situ measurements employing X-ray and neutron beams 5 Publications from Prior NCNR Instrument Time None
