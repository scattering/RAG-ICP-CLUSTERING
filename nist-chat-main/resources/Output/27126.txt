 1Transport of Radionuclides Generated by Nuclear Explosions into Urban Materials Austin Ladshaw Sotira Yiacoumi Georgia Institute of Technology Costas Tsouris Kristian Myhre Oak Ridge National Laboratory Yong-Ha Kim Louisiana State University Jake LaManna National Institutes of Standards and Technology Introduction After a nuclear explosion urban materials such as brick and concrete will be exposed to high levels of radiation and radionuclides which can be absorbed and modify the properties of the materials As the radionuclides begin to diffuse through urban materials various phenomena and mechanisms can occur including i adsorption to interior surfaces ii nuclear transformations and iii induced charging of the material from electron emissions From these mechanisms the penetration depth into the material and the distribution of resulting nuclides will create a unique signature based on the time of exposure and the original source nuclides For instance consider a concrete slab whose surface is exposed to fallout containing Cs-140 Figure 1 As the Cs-140 begins to absorb into the concrete it will undergo beta decay into Ba-140 Since Cs-140 has a relatively short half-life the penetration depth for Cs-140 will be shorter compared to the depth of Ba-140 which has a much longer half-life Then Ba-140 will also decay into La-140 whose penetration depth is expected to also be different The penetration depths for each radionuclide will depend on i the original source nuclide ii the exposure time iii the diffusion characteristics of each parent and daughter nuclide and iv the adsorption partition coefficient of each nuclide Since this depth pattern will be unique to the source nuclide and exposure time investigations into the penetration depth and absorption behavior of those nuclides may lead to the development of advanced techniques for nuclear forensics and diagnostics to aid in the determination of the radiation source Thus it is proposed that experiments be performed on common urban materials using a variety of nuclides to characterize how those materials diffuse and adsorb over time such that a library of information is developed for predicting the behavior of urban materials after a hypothetical nuclear explosion Necessary Work Neutron tomography experiments will be performed using stable isotope versions of common fission products from nuclear weapons Cs Ba La Gd Tb Dy1 These elements represent both the original source nuclides and the daughter nuclides that are typically formed within the first few hours of a nuclear fission event The above fission products were also selected because they can be readily dissolved into aqueous solutions Brick and concrete samples characterized in terms of porosity surface area per unit mass water and sand content will be exposed to heavy water containing such elements Elements with high cross section for neutron absorption will be used first Then over time neutron imaging and tomography will be used to see how the penetration depth varies with exposure time PenetraonDepth 0ExposedSurfaceofMaterialNuclideLegendCs-140Ba-140La-140Cs-140DepthBa-140DepthLa-140DepthFigure 1 Conceptual transport of Cs-140 generated after a nuclear explosion through urban materials such as a brick 2Data collected from these experiments will be analyzed computationally towards characterizing and estimating the adsorption partition coefficients and diffusion rates of each element Advanced computer modeling will then be employed to simulate the formation of the distribution of radionuclides in the material as a function of penetration depth and exposure time based on the source nuclides decay chain half-live of each nuclide and diffusion and adsorption characteristics of each nuclide A brief description of the proposed model for system analysis is provided in the next section Proposed Model Since the nuclides will be carried in an aqueous solution the model must consider the capillary diffusion of water into the urban materials as well as the molecular diffusion of the nuclides within that water and their affinity for binding to various sites within the urban material The process of capillary diffusion can be modeled using equation 1 where q is the normalized water content of the material and D is the capillarity diffusivity The transport of aqueous nuclides ci through the material will to be a function of the water content material porosity e and bulk density rB Thus their movement through urban materials can be represented as shown in equation 223 1 2 Equation 2 includes mechanisms for diffusion of the ith nuclide Di adsorption of that nuclide to surface sites in the material qi generation of the ith nuclide through j other nuclides with an associated branch fraction bij and loss of the ith nuclide through the decay constant li For the proposed experiments we will work with stable nuclides so the decay part of equation 2 can be disregarded during data analysis however the adsorption of nuclides at various activeoxide sites in the materials cannot be neglected To include the adsorption term we can consider a simple one-site chemical reaction model equation 3 to represent the immobilization of the nuclides In this reaction scheme S represents the number of available activeoxides sites at a particular location in the domain 3 To facilitate the modeling work a coupled diffusion and adsorption platform will be employed that has been developed in prior research for similar diffusion analyses4 This framework is especially equipped to simulate non-linear diffusion kinetics into porous materials while simultaneously optimizing for unknown diffusivities to provide approximations for the diffusion characteristics of various solutesadsorbates In addition a 3D model of these processes will be developed using the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment MOOSE that will be used to produce simulated 3D renderings of the transport of solutes through the materials5 Those renderings can then be compared against the neutron imaging results for comparative assessment and validation Preliminary Experiments In preliminary neutron imaging experiments at NIST we first measured neutron attenuation through concrete samples of different porosity prepared at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL Experiments were also performed to investigate capillary-force induced transport of water and Gd ions in D2O through concrete samples The objective of these experiments was to define optimal experimental conditions for subsequent transport experiments These preliminary measurements revealed that the path-length through concrete samples should be on the order of 5 mm instead of the 10-mm samples used Capillary-induced transport occurred but not to the extent expected Vaporization of the solution was ti D  ci ti Di ci   Bqit bij jc jj icici  S qi 3included in the analysis of the measurements It was also revealed that Gd adsorbed onto the concrete surface and did not penetrate the sample pores as deeply as water did Based on the conclusions made from the preliminary experiments corrections will be made in the sample consistency and geometry as well as in the experimental arrangement for the next phase of transport studies discussed below Proposed Experiments Two types of common urban samples with various water-to-cement ratios andor porosities will be employed in the proposed experiments i concrete and ii brick slabs The neutron pathlength will be 5 mm and transport experiments will be performed with a water and b Gd in D2O solutions which will be mounted on the top of the samples Special care will be taken to avoid leaking of the solution on the external surface of the samples Both ex situ and in situ experiments will be conducted The former will be performed at ORNL for certain periods of time and samples will be properly preserved for neutron radiography measurements The latter experiments will be performed at the beamline In addition experiments with competing ions in the solution such as Gd and Na will be performed to investigate competition effects Neutron radiography and tomography will be performed to determine if there are preferential paths for transport and if a fingering behavior can be detected Complementary to neutron and X-ray imaging laser induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS depth-profiling measurements will be performed at ORNL to provide a complete set of data that can be used to determine transport parameters needed in modeling Depth profiling with LIBS can provide high depth resolution 1 m but is not capable of completely analyzing larger samples like neutron radiography and tomography techniques Four days of user time are needed for the proposed
