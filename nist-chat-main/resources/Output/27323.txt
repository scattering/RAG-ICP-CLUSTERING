 Page 1 of 3 Studying the Effect of d-Spacing on the Electrochemical Performance of MXene Scientific Importance Electrically conductive 2D materials known as MXenes a novel family of 2D transition metal carbides discovered in 2011 have already been shown to have enormous potential in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to their capability to host ions and protons in addition to their high electrical conductivity1 Ti3C2 shown in Figure 1a-b is the most studied MXene as it was the first synthesized of that large family MXenes exhibit excellent capacitance at high rates in aqueous electrolytes specially in H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte as shown in Figure 1c but in a narrow potential window which limits the energy density Moreover oxidation of Ti3C2 under high anodic potentials in aqueous electrolytes further limits its use to cathodes of asymmetric devices Organic electrolyte and room temperature ionic liquids RTIL can provide higher potential window leading higher energy density and open circuit potential While they can host other ions beyond protons the rate capability of MXenes is not at the same level as what has been achieved in aqueous electrolytes We hypothesis that there should be an optimum d-spacing that can allow for fast ions beyond protons for high power with high energy considering the larger voltage window offered by both organic and RTIL electrolytes To test this hypothesis we are studying the effect of inter-layer spacing on the overall electrochemical performance of the electrodes 1 M 1-ethly-3-methylimidazolium bis-trifluoromethylsulfonyl-imide EMITFSI in acetonitrile and neat EMITFSI were employed as electrolytes for three-electrode system Figure 1 a SEM2 and b TEM3 images of Ti3C2 MXene c Cyclic voltammetry data collected at scan rates from 10 to 100000 mV s-1 for a 90-nm-thick Ti3C2 MXene4 Scale bar is 200 nm in a and 40 nm in b The behavior of EMI in the interlayer spaces is an integral part of our understanding of the behavior of electrolytes in pseudocapacitors made from MXene materials with different interlayer spacing EMI are known to intercalate between the layers of MXenes However how exactly EMI behave as an intercalant when confined on surfaces is unknown Also how presence of ions affects the dynamics in confinement of MXene is another important question considering that using such d-spacing tuned electrode materials in organic electrolyte and RTIL is one of their potential applications Here using Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering QENS which relies on the high incoherent neutron scattering cross-section of hydrogen of EMI we propose to investigate the microscopic dynamics of EMI present in MXene with and without intercalated ions Development of a predictive understanding of MXene with different interlayer spacing and their capacitive properties enables the transformative advances in capacitive electrical energy storage and other energy-relevant interfacial systems Preliminary Work The samples were synthesized following the reference5 XRD testing showed that the d-spacing were different with different chain-length indicating that the c-LP after equilibration with alkylammonium slats tetramethylammonium chloride decyltrimethylammonium bromide and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide denote to C1 C10 and C12 respectively was expended Specifically the longer chain-length the larger d-spacing This expansion is attributed to intercalation of the alkylammonium cations between the MXene layers Figure 2a shows the rate capabilities of pristine Ti3C2 and C1 C10 and C12 intercalated Ti3C2 in 1 M EMITFSIAN at different current densities from 02 to 10 A g-1 It exhibited the same trends with CV curves which is C12 showed a specific capacitance of 215 F g-1 at a current density of 02 A g-1 which is larger than C1 C10 and pristine C0 sample The specific capacity decreased to 75 F g-1 with the current densities increasing from 02 A g-1 to 10 A g-1 However the specific capacity can retrieve up to 175 F g-1 when the current density decreased to 20 mA g-1 demonstrating the excellent capability and Page 2 of 3 reversible electrochemical process This is due to the porous and layered structure of MXene with short ion diffusion pathway Similar trend was found from long-term cyclability Figure 2b that C12 showed the largest specific capacitance compared to all the rest samples To further investigate the electrochemical performance of C12 intercalated Ti3C2 neat room temperature ionic liquid EMITFSI was employed as electrolyte in a three-electrode cells activated carbon and Ag wire as counter and reference electrodes respectively CV tests were performed in a window of -2 to 12 V vs Ag at a scan rate of 1 mVs as shown in Figure 2c It is noted that C12 in neat EMITFSI electrolyte shows much large CV area than that in 1 M EMITFSIAN electrolyte indicating C12 in neat EMITFSI electrolyte exhibit much larger specific capacitance than that in 1 M EMITFSIAN electrolyte From Figure 2d C12 intercalated Ti3C2 shows a specific capacitance of 131 Fg which is larger than that in EMITFSIAN electrolyte The reason behind the higher capacitance for C12 in neat electrolyte compared to EMITFSI in AN is a topic of ongoing studies 050100150200250300000025050075100125 C0 C12 T KBeforeTestingC0 Sample mass  0770 gC12

compared to C0 as reflected in the mean square displacement of the ions presented Fig 2e The aim of the proposed research is to explore dynamics of EMI confined on the surface in neat EMITFSI electrolyte Preliminary data presented above clearly show that the ions get into the MXene layer during electrochemical cycling Data presented in Fig 2e justifies that the mobility of EMI will be within the energy resolution and dynamical range covered by HFBS spectrometer Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We propose a plan to study the dynamics of EMI confined on the surface in neat EMITFSI electrolyte We would use four samples pure MXene Ti3C2 before and after electrochemical intercalation C12 intercalated Ti3C2 before and after electrochemical intercalation These samples will be synthesized using well-established procedures Following the previously established procedures samples will be heated at 110oC in vacuum for 24 hours to remove surface bound water and will be performed electrochemical testing in glovebox QENS spectra will be measured at 4 K to measure sample specific resolution and at 300 K We will also perform the elastic intensity scan of each sample from 20 to 300 K at 2K minutes on Based on our previous experiences to complete this set of experiments we request 5 days of beam time on HFBS spectrometer Data will be interpreted using one-component model used previously in the analysis of EMI dynamics in MXenes Safety Considerations These samples do not pose any safety concerns References 1 Naguib M Mochalin V N Barsoum M W and Gogotsi Y Adv Mater 2014 26
