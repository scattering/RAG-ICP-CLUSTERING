 Page 1 of 3 Structure of Polyionic Protein-Polymer Complexes Amir Erfani Javen Weston Katie Weigandt Josh Ramsey and Clint P Aichele Background and Scientific Importance Advancement of therapeutic protein therapies has been hindered by the poor stability and short half-life of proteins in vivo Polyions can form stable complexes with proteins which can help delivery of proteins inside the body and help prevent protein clearance and protease These complexes can also be conjugated with hydrophilic polymers like poly ethylene glycol PEG to extend their half-life and prevent aggregation and immunogenicity We have carried out extensive research in our lab resulting in evaluating polymers that form complexes nanogels with biomolecules for protein or gene delivery purposes 1- The structure of these polyions the dynamics of the protein-polymer complexes the structure in protein solutions and their effect on the protein tertiary structure are not well understood Currently we are synthesizing two types of these polyionic-protein complexes pegylated and zwitterionic poly l-lysine PLL SANS has been used to evaluate the hydration structure and dynamics of a variety of proteins However to our knowledge the structure of these polyion-protein architectures is virtually unknown SANS offers the unique ability to use contrast matching to isolate scattering in multi-component systems in this case protein shell and polymer core Prior work has indicated that the scattering length densities of the polymers and proteins of interest to us are sufficiently different for contrast matching experiments to be a realistic option No technique beyond SANS allows for this level of contrast matching without altering the solution chemistry Preliminary Work We have carried out different bio-physical characterization studies on effects of these zwitterionic polymers on protein hydration and stability We have carried out 1H NMR experiments to characterize these polymers Fig 1 illustrates the formation of polymer - protein complexes due to electrostatic self-assembly while Fig 2 illustrates the TEM image of such complexes Fig 3 shows some preliminary SANS measurements measured at the NIST Center for Neutron Researchs NGB-10m SANS instrument for the BSA protein Figure 1 Schematic of the formation of copolymer-protein BCHE complexes  Page 2 of 3 Experiment Plan Two varieties of nanogels stabilized by electrostatic forces will be investigated The first will use PEG-g-PLL PLL at physiological pHs is a cationic rigid polymer Due to the electrostatic attraction PLL is capable of forming complexes with negatively charged proteins such as BSA effectively encapsulating the protein Here we will be studying the structure of such complexes We are interested to investigate if the Porod number of the PLL changes when it is in the complex with BSA Also as this polymer is pegylated we are planning to study the hydrophilic polymer PEG elongation on the backbone of the PLL and in complexes with BSA Our hypothesis is that PLL becomes more flexible when protein-protein complexes form which is caused by local charge neutralization Similarly we have synthesized new types of protein encapsulating polymers by zwitterionized PLL This new class of complex forming polymer have not been previously studied and the structural information on this system would be very informative The structures and interactions our experiments intend to probe are perfectly within the range of those probed by the SANS instrument 1-100 nm Also the contrast matching technique will allow us to study the structure and dynamics of the protein and the polymer molecules separately in a mixture This will allow us to explore the structure and dynamics of the polymers in the presence of the biomacromolecules First we must determine the scattering length density of the polyions and proteins used in our experiment We will use Bovine Serum Albumin BSA a as a model protein for our studies for which the scattering length density is well established in the literature We will use two polyions in this work Well-defined narrowly poly-dispersed polymers PEG-g-PLL and PZ-g-PLL will be synthesized in our lab and will be studied at concentrations of 30-40 mgml based on our preliminary results Both polyions will require 3 hours to perform a contrast variation series in order to determine the scattering length density 6 hours total Once the SLD of the polyions has been determined a sample series that varies polymer grafting ratio polymer-protein ratio and scattering length density will be prepared as summarized in table 1 The protein concentration will be held fixed at 20 mgmL to ensure sufficient signal but prevent multiple scattering In addition to the contrast variation series 24 samples will be prepared Each sample is expected to take 15-2 hours depending on contrast and concentration A total of 2 days is requested to complete the experiment on a 30 m SANS instrument Figure 2 TEM of the copolymer-protein complexes scale bar is 100 nm  Figure 3 Scattering intensity curves for buffered BSA in H2O The BSA scattering shows an unacceptable level of noise at low-q which will be addressed by reducing the incoherent background and increasing the measurement time in future experiments probing the same q range Page 3 of 3 Table I Proteinpolymer complexes

the hydration layer amount of bound water will be deduced using the methods described by Bendedouch and Svergun 4  Scattering will also be analyzed using the SasView program along with appropriate models for proteins dissolved polymers and hydrogels The results of this study will help the PhD student involved in this project to complete his researchthesis on the interactions of zwitterionic moieties with proteins Results will be published in top peer-reviewed journals such as Langmuir Biomacromolecules and ACS biomaterials Science and Engineering The results of this study will help provide fundamental insights into the mechanism by which polyionic complexes can help prevent non-specific binding and decrease immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins This better understanding can later translate to designing functional protein-polymer complexes for protein delivery and protein formulations that can address deterrents in advancements of biopharmaceuticals References 1 Flynn N
