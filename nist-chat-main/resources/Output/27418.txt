The interaction of SDS with Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION Lipolytic enzymes or lipases not only have important biological functions in the lipid metabolism but also are used in numerous applications1 The substrates for lipolytic enzymes are self-assembled structures or aggregates of different lipid molecules Most natural substrates have low aqueous solubility and are dispersed in or exposed to an aqueous solution containing the enzyme Lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosa TLL has a lid consisting of protein residues 82-89 that plays an important role in the activation of the enzyme At the triolein aqueous interface TLL undergoes a conformational change The lid region is dislocated to expose the catalytic triad of S146 H258 and D2012 The dislocation of S83 for example enables bonding of NH between the substrate and lipase and a nucleophilic attack happens on the scissile ester bond which initiates the hydrolysis of the substrate3 Mutations in the lid region can prevent the change in conformation thus the lid differs between wildtype and the inactive forms of TLL In this experiment the inactive TLL S146A and locked TLL C86C255 have mutations inside the catalytic triad and inside the lid region respectively TLL is one of most common used enzymes in detergents where it works together surfactants like Sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS Here the interaction between the lipase and the detergent is crucial Here we intend to study the interaction of SDS with the wild type active TLL as well as the locked TLL For this purpose we will use hydrogenated as well as deuterated SDS Figure 1 Coarse grained simulation of SDS micelles in interaction with the locked TLL Locked variant in yellow and micelles in green and with yellow head groups The simulated micelles are probably a bit smaller than at least thereotical and other measures in this setup than is appr 80 SDS molecules Typical the simulation have between 50 and 65 SDS molecules per micelle Sizes here are long side of 89 for lipase-micelle and 70 for two micelles Figure 2 Inhouse SAXS data for mixtures of Locked TLL and SDS TLL1800 is 1800 ppm TLL TLL900 is 900 ppm TLL SDS20 is 20 mM SDS and SDS40 is 40 mM SDS The cmc for SDS is 85 mM in water Figure 1 shows coarse grained simulation of mixtures of TLL and SDS Figure 2 shows the SAXS data for mixtures of locked TLL and SDS The SAXS data is rather noisy with high background and long acquisition times of several hours per curve and it required also high protein concentration The peak at Q 018 -1 or a spacing of about 35  at lowest TLL and highest SDS concentration is most likely from the SDS micelles This value is half of what is found for two SDS molecules together in the coarse grained simulations Figure 1 With this proposal we ask for SANS beamtime to reveal the structure of complexes of SDS with active and Locked TLL Using h-SDS and d-SDS and contrast matching we will be able to localise the SDS in the complexes and possibly how it affects the TLL structure We will also reveal if the wild type TLL and the locked mutant of TLL behaves differently EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Sample preparation Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase of the wild typed and the locked mutant will be incubated with SDS at concentration above and below cmc 0mM SDS pure protein 1 mM SDS 5 mM SDS  20 mM SDS and 40 mM SDS We will use 900 and 1800 ppm TLL SANS data collection To determine the contrast match point for each enzyme we will analyze both on 5 different isotopic contrasts around 4010 D2O The effect of match point with d-SDS below cmc 1 and 5 mM will also be determined After that we will measure the SANS of the mixtures of enzyme using 3 isotopic contrasts 100 D2O and 100 H2O as well as the enzyme match point We will use 3 contrasts h- and d-SDS 2 types of TLL 2 TLL concentrations and 4 SDS concentrations samples which will make 96 samples We want to investigate the full Q range of 0009 nm-1 to 70 nm-1 and therefore request the NGB30 SANS instrument With background and transmission runs we expect an average of 1h per sample and hence we request 4 days of beamtime to complete our measurements REFERENCES Schmid R D and Verger R 1998 Lipases interfacial enzymes with attractive applications Angew Chem Int Ed 37 pp 1608-1633  Willems N et al The effect of mutations in the lid region of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase on interactions with triglyceride surfaces A multi-scale simulation study Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 211 4-15 2018  Skjold-Jrgensen J et al Understanding the activation mechanism of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase using rational design and tryptophan-induced fluorescence quenching Lipid Sci Technol 118 1644-1660 2016
