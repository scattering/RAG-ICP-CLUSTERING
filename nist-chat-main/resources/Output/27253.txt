Magnetic Structure of Time-Reversal and Inversion Symmetry Breaking Weyl Semi-Metals Motivation and goal of the experiment The discovery of quantum materials with new and useful properties is an important frontier of research in condensed matter physics The concept of topology has recently flourished that field via theoretical predictions of materials with exotic surface state properties that are protected by specific symmetry of the bulk crystal  Various topological non-trivial states have been predicted such as a Weyl semimetal where Weyl fermions emerge in a material due to a linear energy-momentum dispersion within its electronic bulk structure  Weyl fermions can be generated by inversion symmetry breaking or by time-reversal symmetry breaking An inversion symmetry breaking Weyl semimetal is realized in a few materials such as TaAs  However a robust experimental realization of a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl semimetal remains scarce Recently ab-initio calculations predicted that materials of composition ReAlGe where Re is a rare earth ion are unique templates for studying Weyl physics  In addition to breaking inversion symmetry these materials are special due to the presence of magnetic Re ions that also allows the possibility of breaking time-reversal symmetry Following this theoretical study linearly dispersive electronic bands attributed to Weyl fermions were observed by ARPES in the non-magnetic LaAlGe  These works motivate experimental efforts in characterizing the magnetism and electronic band structure of magnetic materials with identical space group than LaAlGe Within that perspective we found that materials with composition NdAlX where X  Ge or Si are promising Fig1A These materials have the same crystal structure as LaAlGe but magnetization data also support ferromagnetic order at low temperature hence this system breaks time-reversal symmetry Our initial neutron diffraction investigations on NdAlSi have shown this material has a ferrimagnetic ground state which is parametrized by three different magnetic ordering vectors that all onset at different temperatures Thermodynamic measurements on NdAlGe suggest a similar phase diagram although neutron diffraction is needed to confirm this scenario We thus request beam time on the double-focusing triple-axis spectrometer BT-7 to resolve this question While we have determined the temperature phase diagram of the magnetic ordering vector of NdAlSi see next section the exact details of its magnetic structure such as the spin anisotropy in the different phases are not fully determined yet Detailed refinement of the complex magnetic structure of NdAlSi would be highly facilitated by polarized neutron analysis which is possible on the BT-7 spectrometer Thus in addition to unpolarized neutron diffraction on NdAlGe we are also requesting 2 days of polarized neutron beam to accurately determine the magnetic structure of NdAlSi Note that we expect a similar magnetic phase diagram for NdAlGe such that the 2 days of the polarized beam will also be useful for this compound Characterization of the samples Using flux growth techniques in collaboration with the group of Fazel Tafti in Boston College we have grown single crystals of NdAlSi and NdAlGe All crystals were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction magnetization resistivity and heat capacity measurements The structural refinement against the x-ray diffraction pattern of NdAlSi is shown in Fig1 B Like for the case of NdAlGe the x-ray pattern of NdAlSi shows phase pure that is well described by a 109 tetragonal space group This space group breaks inversion symmetry due to the ordering of the Al and Si lattices However the same quality fit can be obtained using the tetragonal space group 141 where the AlSi lattices are disordered and do not break inversion symmetry Second-harmonic generation measurements have determined that NdAlSi breaks inversion symmetry so we inferred these materials crystallize into the 109 space group Magnetization data of NdAlSi is shown in Fig1 C and reveals ferromagnetic order near 35 K A similar result is obtained for NdAlGe where ferromagnetism occur near  Heat capacity measurement on NdAlSi is shown in Fig1 D and while there is a peak in the heat capacity around 35 K the phase transition occurs slightly above near 8 K We have investigated the zero-field phase diagram of NdAlSi using the cold neutron triple-axis SPINS at NIST A summary of our neutron diffraction results is shown in Fig1 E where the temperature dependence of the different magnetic ordering vectors is shown Long-range antiferromagnetic order was detected below 8 K with ordering vector k  23230 This magnetic ordering induces a gradual increase of an incommensurate order with k  00 with   0027 Near 35 K the incommensurate phase vanishes and a long-range ferromagnetic order with k  000 appears A proper magnetic refinement was performed for the k  000 and k  00 phase but only two Bragg peaks of the 23230 phase were observed such that the exact spin arrangement of this phase is unknown We wish to answer this question using polarized neutron diffraction which will allow direct evidence of the spin anisotropy in that phase Two days of beam time is requested for this matter Finally the heat capacity of NdAlGe is also plotted in Fig1 D and two transitions are also observed in this compound suggesting a similar magnetic phase diagram We would like to investigate the different magnetic ordering in NdAlGe to compare and contrast with its sister compound NdAlSi For this part we are requesting 4 days of unpolarized beam time on BT-7 Plan of the experiment Unpolarized neutron beam configuration 4 days Two single crystals of NdAlGe will be co-mounted on an Al post and installed in an orange cryostat One crystal will be aligned such that the H0L is in the scattering plane while the second crystal will be aligned such that the HHL is in the scattering plane The 00L direction of both crystals will be slightly offset  5 to each other such that the Bragg peaks of both crystals will not overlap At first rocking scans on all structural Bragg peaks of both crystals will be measured to refine the nuclear structure of NdAlGe Afterward line scans along high symmetry directions will be performed in the 3 different magnetic phases that is 55 K  T  7 K 475 K  T  55 K and T  4 K This procedure will allow the determination of the magnetic ordering vector within the different phases Finally a series of rocking scans centered at each magnetically allowed positions will be collected to do a robust magnetic refinement for all the magnetic phases Polarized neutron beam configuration 2 days A single crystal of NdAlSi and NdAlGe will be co-mounted on an Al post and installed in an orange cryostat Note that we will also mount a PG sample on the Al post such that the sample depolarization of the neutron beam can be characterized within the same experimental configuration than the experiment Both crystals will be aligned such that the HHL is in the scattering plane but offset to each other to avoid overlap of the Bragg peaks The sample will be cool down to about 6 K where the magnetic phase is in the pure k  23230 phase See Fig1 E Spin-flip and non spin-flip cross-sections for both vertical VF and horizontal HF polarization configurations will be collected on all the 23230 Bragg peaks The cross-sections in the HF configuration allow unambiguous determination of the magnetic origin of these Bragg peaks Symmetry analysis of the 23230 phase suggests a spin density wave and the polarization of this spin density wave can be determined using the cross-sections obtained in the VF configuration Fig1 A
