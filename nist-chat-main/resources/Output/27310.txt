Analysis of the AC Magnetic Response of Iron Oxide Nanoflowers with Time-Resolved SANS The use of functionalized magnetic nano-objects in biology and medicine has increased dramatically during the past two decades Many applications such as imaging therapeutic heating hyperthermia or drug delivery exploit the unique physical and magnetic properties inherent in magnetic materials that possess characteristic dimensions smaller than 150 nm In addition these applications also use AC magnetic fields Unfortunately knowledge of the behavior of magnetic nanoparticles under AC fields even at low frequencies is limited to highly simplified models that do not come close the explaining the complexity of behavior in real systems The collective response of the colloid to the AC field especially in terms of the magnetic nanoparticle structure and interactions is unknown Unfortunately probing the actual physical and magnetic behavior of the nanoparticles in a colloidal solution on the time scale of oscillation is incredibly difficult Neutron scattering is the only technique to allow this Time-resolved SANS is a powerful method to probe not only the magnetic interactions and their timescales within a colloid but also the resulting physical structure within a colloid of practical concentration The nanoparticles we will use were synthesized by Micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH explicitly for magnetic particle imaging MPI  As MPI and time-resolved SANS at NCNR have the same upper frequency limit of 25 kHz our nanoparticle system is perfectly tailed for NCNRs time-resolved capability There are two forms of the nanoparticle system both consists of the same nanoflower core but with distinct shells of dextran and starch to control the interactions The concentration is the same for both at 25 mgml The physical and magnetic characterization is on-going and includes x-ray diffraction Mossbauer spectroscopy magnetometry transmission electron microscopy and hopefully polarization analyzed SANS This system will be compared experimentally with previous time-resolved SANS work on other well-characterized magnetic nanoparticle systems The expectation is that this will be final key to understanding the magnetic response and developing good models for the behavior Therefore on each of the two samples in both H2O and D2O contrast matches we will collect time-averaged and time-sliced data under an AC magnetic field of 1 Hz 10 Hz 100 Hz 1 kHz 10 kHz and 25 kHz and magnetic field amplitudes of 1 mT 7 mT 10 mT 25 mT 50 mT and 70 mT at each frequency The comparison of the time averaged and time-sliced data will help separate out the changes in the colloidal structure In addition tracking the signal at a specific Q as a function of frequency will hopefully provide quantitative information on the frequency dependence of the coercivity In consultation with the instrument scientists who are developing this technique at NCNR we are requesting 4 days of beam time  B Gleich and J Weizenecker Nature 435 2005 1214
