Proposal for Neutron Scattering Study of Frustrated PyrochloreMagnet Tb2Ti2O7Thomas Halloran1 2 Huiyuan Man1 2 Seyed Koohpayeh1 2 and Collin Broholm1 21Department of Physics and Astronomy Johns Hopkins University2Institute for Quantum MatterDated November 2019I Scientific BackgroundFrustration in pyrocholore systems arisesfrom antiferromagnetic interactions along the2D triangular plane of magnetic ions cre-ated by the corner sharing tetrahedra of mag-netic rare-earth ions Due to local symme-tries it is impossible to satisfy the local in-teractions giving rise to a highly frustratedground state that may host exotic new phasesof matter like quantum spin-ice In such sys-tems quantum fluctuations would prevail overlong-range static magnetic ordering yet todate few compelling examples of this existTheoretically in pyrochlores like Tb2Ti2O7nearest-neighbor interactions suppress orderand create a cooperative paramagnetic stateThe ice rules state that the lowest energyground state requires that the net numberof spins pointing into each tetrahedra is zero In reality the vast majority of these sys-tems do in fact order due to other kinds ofinteractions between the magnetic ionsTb2Ti2O7 remains a quantum spin-icecandidate whose ground state is not welldefined in the literature The magneticion Tb3 is non-Kramers with crystal fieldlevels appearing at energies on the energyscale of 15meV and above Specific heatin some samples shows a transition aroundT400mK yet others show no such transi-tion  The single-ion properties of Tb3have shown that the measured moment of 5 B is substantially different from thefree-ion value of 96 B  Theory shows thatthis should induce ordering around T1Kyet experiment has shown no such resultmeaning that the standard dipole interactionmodel fails for this system Instead it may benecessary to consider the sizable quadropolarmoment of Tb or a different model altogetherPrevious inelastic neutron scattering stud-ies show broad diffuse scattering at energytransfers above 01 meV and features resem-bling pinch points at the 11 and 00 po-sitions in the reciprocal space  These cor-relations are consistent with a two-in two-outconfiguration on a doubled unit cell Previ-ous authors have interpreted this as supportfor a quantum spin-ice interpretation of theground stateII Sample Dependence and PreviousStudiesInterpretation of these results becomesdifficult when considering the varying qual-ity of samples in the literature While in-elastic neutron spectra appear to be consis-tent across samples the specific heat tellsa different story The elastic scattering at12 12 12 which is associated with the two-intwo-out ordering observed is attributed to thepeak in specific heat at T400mK whichis inconsistent across samples Indeed theground state of Tb2Ti2O7 has been shown tobe very stoichiometry dependent when theTb content is carefully controlled Otherrare-earth pyrocholore systems have showncompletely different ground states with onlyminute changes in sample qualityWe have synthesized new single-crystalsamples of Tb2Ti2O7 by the traveling solventfloating zone method They immediately dif-fer from the literature in that they are trans-parent instead of black More rigorously we2compare our specific heat measurements tothe literature Fig 1 and find no T400mKpeak that other authors observe 2 5- In-stead we have a far lower overall heat capac-ity in millikelvin temperatures with entropythat is removed with the application of fieldThis is suggestive that the ground state is dif-ferent from other samples in the literature10g of crystalline sample was taken to theBASIS instrument at Oak Ridge NationalLab Here we used the backscattering geom-etry of the instrument to very finely resolvethe low energy inelastic neutron spectrum toa resolution of 3 eV  Our preliminary re-sults are already quite different from those inprevious experiments As expected from thelack of a peak in specific heat we see no clearelastic scattering at 12 12 12 In fact there isno clear structure to the elastic scattering atall Fig 2 The inelastic spectrum is quali-tatively the same as what has been observedin other samples with diffuse checkerboard-like scattering Fig 3 While we alreadyhave quite a bit of information regarding theground state from this measurement to tella complete story we require a higher energymeasurement up to the scale of the crystalfield levels for a full inelastic spectrumIII Sample Environment andExperiment PlanOne limitation of the BASIS instrumentis the lack of in-plane detectors due to thebackscattering geometry To this end theMACS instrument would be a great tool tofirst verify the lack of 12 12 12 elastic mag-netic scattering and then to observe a higherenergy transfer regime 03meV-10meV Wewould require a dilution refrigerator sam-ple environment as the relevant temperatureregime in this material is T400mK Moresample can be synthesized but the previoussample is ready and is still at ORNL It couldreadily be shipped to NCNR We request fivedays to perform this measurement Four ofthese days would be used to carefully mea-sure the elastic and inelastic spectra at basetemperature The rest would be used to takea high temperature measurement T 20Kas a background to seperate out the magneticscatteringIV ConclusionTb2Ti2O7 is a material with a long his-tory but with no satisfying characterizationof its ground state Thanks to improved sam-ple quality we have shown behavior in spe-cific heat and neutron scattering that con-flicts with what has previously been reportedTo settle this discrepancy we propose a lowtemperature measurement on the MACS in-strument to see how the inelastic excitationspectra of our sample compares to that of pre-vious works Combined with the measure-ment on BASIS we should be able to usethis information to achieve a new level ofunderstanding of the curious magnetism
