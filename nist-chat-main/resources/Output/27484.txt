November 2019 NCNR Beamtime Proposal 1 Network Structure of Lignin-Based Hydrogels for Aqueous and Bioseparations Nicholas Gregorich PhD Candidate Clemson University Tyler Martin Beamline Scientist NCNR Eric M Davis Assistant Professor Clemson University Instrument 10m Small-Angle Neutron Scattering SANS The use of lignin in biopolymer-based composite hydrogels holds significant potential for added value in biological applications such as protein delivery tissue engineering and bioseparations1 Present in nearly all plants lignin is abundant and economical and possesses several attractive qualities for these applications including being biocompatible biodegradable antimicrobial and antibacterial In particular recent studies have indicated that certain proteins exhibit strong nonspecific interactions with lignin holding potentially profound implications for both protein separation and protein transient immobilization and controlled release4 Soft composites are particularly ideal for these biological applications as the selectivity of the membrane can be directly influenced through manipulation of its network structure ie mesh or pore size Unfortunately developing lignin-based hydrogels for targeted bioseparations processes is hindered by our lack of understanding of how the addition of the lignin to these soft composites alters the crosslinked network structure of the resultant composite membrane Furthermore conventional methods used to recover lignin indiscriminately precipitate crude bulk lignins CBLs from solution resulting in lignins with a broad range of molecular weights MWs purities and chemical architectures When used in the synthesis of composite hydrogels the heterogeneity of the lignins results in composites with ill-defined network structures which obfuscate the molecular-scale interactions and fundamental principles governing transport in these composites In addition conventional recovery methods can yield lignin solutions with high metals content ie 10000 ppm Membrane Material BSA Permeability cm2s Neat PVA 73 x 10-13 PVA  CBL unfunctionalized 31 x 10-13 PVA  L-1500Da unfunctionalized 55 x 10-14 b Figure 1 a

they can leach out of the composite material into the human body or into an expensive product stream presenting both a health risk and a risk for product contamination To directly address these issues a series of lignin-based hydrogels was fabricated see Fig 1a leveraging a lignin purification process recently developed at Clemson University US Patent No 10053482 August 2018 see Fig 1b This purification process uses renewable solvents to both fractionate and clean the dirty CBLs producing ultraclean lignins of prescribed MWs in Fig 1a MW 1500 g mol-1 or Dalton L-1500Da Here the term ultraclean refers to lignin with very low metals content  50 ppm metals As a standard for comparison Fig 1a shows two control membranes neat or unmodified PVA along with a lignin-based composite fabricated with crude bulk lignins Promising preliminary results see Fig 1c suggest that the molecular architecture of the lignin plays an important role in governing molecular interactions and protein transport properties of the composite hydrogel membrane as the PVA  L-1500Da membrane exhibits almost an order of magnitude decrease in BSA permeability Here the terms unfunctionalized and functionalized refers to the acrylation of hydroxyl -OH groups on the lignin replacing them with acryloyl groups H2CCH-CO- Once acrylated the lignin functions as a crosslinker between itself and the PVA chains providing more direct control over the mesh size of the composite membrane versus the heuristic addition of heterogenous lignin to the membrane To obtain insight into the fundamental structure-property relationships governing bioseparations in these composite hydrogels we propose a systematic investigation on the effect of host polymer MW in this case PVA at 25K g mol-1 and 78K g

lignin-based PVA composite hydrogels Using lignins with low dispersity  and prescribed MWs to systematically vary the network structure of the composite hydrogels will facilitate the discovery of fundamental relationships between membrane structure molecular interactions and protein transport Small-Angle Neutron Scattering SANS - We propose to characterize the network structure of the hydrated composite membranes via hydrated SANS measurements Nanoscale structure of hydrogels has been successfully interrogated via SANS where the use of deuterium oxide D2O provides the contrast between the polymer and solvent necessary to obtain information about the network structure of the hydrogel Specifically a scattering model developed by Hammouda and coworkers will be employed to model the scattering data obtained from SANS experiments as this model has been previously utilized to analyze neutron scattering data from solvent-swollen hydrogels The neutron scattering intensity can be modeled by the following equation LBkg  where and are the scattering intensity and scattering vector respectively The exponents and are the Porod and Lorentzian exponent respectively These exponents provide information on the fractal structure of the hydrogel as well as provide a measure of the thermodynamics of the system The Lorentzian screening length L can be thought of as a correlation length between polymer chains and is essentially a measure of the mesh size of the crosslinked hydrogel Results from scattering experiments will be compared with those obtained from poroelastic relaxation indentation PRI experiments that will be carried out by Nick Gregorich and Prof Davis at Clemson University Together these properties will be used to determine an effective pore size for each composite hydrogel membrane The pore structure of the hydrogel directly impacts the transport properties and thus the selectivity of the crosslinked hydrogels Along these lines preliminary SANS experiments were performed on hydrated neat PVA PVA  CBLs and PVA  L-1500Da containing unfunctionalized lignin which are shown in Fig 2 As seen in Fig 2 PVA membranes containing unfunctionalized CBLs showed a drastically different scattering curve than the similar scattering curves seen for neat PVA and PVA  L-1500Da membranes These preliminary results suggest that the introduction of just 10 wt CBLs to the PVA membrane alters the formation of the pore structure of the composite hydrogel These results also corroborate the changes November 2019 NCNR Beamtime Proposal 3 in poroelastic time scale measured via PRI which indicated the formation of a looser network structure for the PVA  CBL membranes Further we can see from Fig 2 that the scattering curves for the neat PVA and PVA  L-1500Da are almost identical indicating similar network structures ie similar mesh size even those the BSA permeability was over an order of magnitude different between these two membranes These preliminary results underscore the need for further SANS studies interrogating the network structure of these lignin-based hydrogels Based on the results of the preliminary SANS measurements we request a total of 96 hours or 4 days to collected hydrated SANS data on 26 individual samples The composite hydrogels will be soaked in D2O for at least 24 h prior to SANS data collection Using two configurations we will investigate a q range of 00035-05 -1 With this we estimate a collection time of 3 hours leaving a little over  a day to collect all other necessary measurements eg blocked beam
