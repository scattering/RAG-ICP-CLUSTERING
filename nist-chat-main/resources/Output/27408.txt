Possible orbital magnetism in a cuprate CuGa2O4 The spin-orbit interaction has recently attracted great attention for the intriguing magnetic states that can result from it Due to the strong spin-orbit interaction in 5d oxide the studies of unconventional spin-orbit magnetism were initially focused on iridates such as possible Kitaev spin-liquid states in Na2IrO3  and unconventional spiral order in Li2IrO3  Recent studies have demonstrated that strong spin-orbit coupling can also be achieved in 4d materials such as RuCl3  Now there is the fascinating possibility that Cu2 the iconic spin-12 ion well known from cuprate superconductors could exhibit an orbital moment when sitting in the tetrahedral A site of the spinel compound AB2O4 with B  Al Ga  A-site spinels are of course well-known for their interesting magnetic properties resulting from magnetic frustration  If Cu sits on the A site the spinel structure would cause its single 3d hole to be shared among the Cu dxy dxz and dyz orbitals which would cause a substantial orbital contribution to the magnetic moment A model of isotropic magnetic exchange leads to a prediction of a novel spiral spin-liquid state  while inclusion of the anisotropic coupling resulting from spin-orbit effects leads to a particular spiral order  Even in the case of site disorder unconventional spin correlations can result  Neutron scattering is the ideal technique for distinguishing these possibilities Recent thermodynamic studies of CuAl2O4 suggest that the Cu moment corresponds to Jeff  12  At the same time magnetization studies of CuAl2O4 and CuGa2O4 have found evidence for a spin-glass transition at  2 K 91 The BNL group has now grown a large over 5g high-quality single crystal of CuGa2O4 by the floating-zone method Based on our preliminary results DC susceptibility measurements show no sign of any transition to magnetic order or spin glass down to 17 K The linear fit of 1M vs T gives a Curie-Weiss temperature of -76 K as shown in Fig1 X-ray powder diffraction measurement shows this crystal has the spinel crystal structure which agrees with the previous report 1 We propose to carry out inelastic neutron scattering measurements to probe the magnetic correlations in CuGa2O4 The measurements will focus on possible magnetic order and low energy magnetic excitations in this compound First we need to know whether there is any static order at the lowest Fig1 DC susceptibility measurement of temperature dependence of inverse M Measured at 100Oe temperature Second we will look for how the low-energy excitations are distributed in reciprocal space and their changes with temperature Based on the recent theory calculation there are special scattering patterns for magnetic order and excitations in the spinel compound  The temperature dependence of magnetic order and excitations in this sample will help us identify the role of anisotropic exchange interactions in this spinel compound and may demonstrate the predicted novel strong spin-orbit coupling states in 3d Oxides MACS will be the best instrument for our experiment The energy resolution of MACS is very important to our measurements since the small Curie-Weiss temperature suggests low energy excitations The multi-detector coverage will also be ideal for covering a large E-Q space in a reasonable time And the high flux at MACS is also essential The single-crystal growth favors a single domain and the structure is cubic which makes the situation much less complicated We would run our experiments in the HK0 plane with 00 vertical and measurements will cover one quadrant We will look for possible magnetic order and low energy excitations in this energy range related to the spin-orbital coupling Our current estimate would be that for each temperature it would take about 68 hours to map out the spin excitations at each energy transfer We would like to measure at least 56 energy transfers from 0 to 3 meV And we would like to get at least 3 temperatures To be able to finish the measure we will be asking for 7 days for the measurements on MACS References  J Chaloupka et al Phys Rev Lett105 027204 2010  A Bifn et al Phys Rev Lett113 197201 2014  A Banerjee et al Science 356 1055 2017  S A Nikolaev et al Phys Rev B 98 201106R 2018  N Tristan et al PhysRevB72 174404 2005  D Bergman et al Nat Phys 3 487 2007  M Iakovleva et al Phys Rev B 91 144419 2015  C H Kim et al arXiv181008594  R Nirmala et al J Phys Condens Matter 29 13LT01 2017 1 G A Petrakovskii et al Phys Rev B 63 184425 2001
