research by Bockstaller and Karim has revealed that the tethering of polymeric ligands to the surface of nanoparticles so called brush particles can induce the autonomous organization of multicomponent particle brush mixtures into monotype domain structures in a process that bears similarity to phase separation in binary polymer blends  This leads to intriguing questions about the role of polymeric ligands on the interactions and assembly formation in particulate materials  Previous studies by the PIs on thin films have revealed the scaling coefficient for domain coarsening d  t02 to be distinctively different from the scaling observed in classical polymer blends d  t03 This points to fundamental differences of the dynamical processes that control domain growth Our hypothesis is that the reduced scaling coefficient is caused by the constraining effect of particle cores that limits diffusion of polymer segments thus giving rise to domain growth via anomalous diffusion This was in fact predicted by De Gennes in a 1980 paper however until now this anomalous growth behavior has not been observed experimentally  Unfortunately thin film experiments cannot be considered unambiguous due to unknown effects of the film substrate The fundamental objective of this DOE-BES funded project is thus to elucidate the physics of phase separation in blends of polymer-tethered particle systems and to test the hypothesis that the connectivity between particle and polymer constituents gives rise to an anomalous growth behavior that eventually transforms into regular diffusion-controlled growth Ultra-small angle neutron scattering SANSUSANS experiments are proposed to elucidate the mechanism and kinetics of the phase separation process of particle brush blend systems as a systematic function of brush architecture and quench depth Here it should be emphasized that neutron scattering experiments are uniquely suited to perform the proposed experiments This is because the high electron density of inorganic particle cores dominates the scattering of X-rays Particle brush blends therefore appear uniform to X-ray probe beams independent of the microstructure The situation is depicted in Figure 1 The posed research objectives bear relevance to a range of areas in polymer and materials science For example the proposed research will not only provide new insights into the physics of polymer and hybrid materials but also provide a foundation for the fabrication of microstructured nanoparticle-based materials which are relevant to a host of energy-related applications Preliminary Work Our material system is based upon polymethyl methacrylate PMMA and polystyrene-r-acrylonitrile PSAN tethered organosilica brush particles oSiO2-PMMAoSiO2-PSAN with appropriate degree of deuteration of polymer The PSANPMMA composition presents an ideal model system for the present study due to the accessibility of all monomers to controlled radical polymerization as well as the abundant prior work on the phase behavior and separation of PSANPMMA homopolymer blends which serve as reference for this study 4-1 Both polymers are amorphous with Tg  110 oC this enables rapid quenching of melt morphologies if needed Furthermore PSAN with a molar composition xS xAN  31 forms a LCST system with PMMA Because phase separation occurs only above the LCST  150 oC this enables fine control of the time and quench depth of the separation process Key to our approach is the use of contrast matching to avoid scattering contributions from particle cores to simplify analysis and to enable early-state domain characterization To enable contrast matched conditions for neutron scattering experiments we have developed a novel chemistry to synthesize organosilica-hybrid particles via crosslinking of organosiloxanes with a tunable and narrow disperse size in the range of d  3-10 nm and temperature stability up to T  210 oC thus the materials can be heated above LCST wo incurring degradation 1 By variation of the HD-isotope composition of the organic component the scattering length density of the hybrid particles can be tailored to be within the range SLD  123 10-10 m2 corresponding to a fully hydrogenated Figure 1 A Illustration of a particle brush blend Blue and red spheres indicate distinct compositions of particle cores B

fully deuterated organosilica core SLD values are reported per structural repeat unit of the organo-siloxane These particle systems will in the following be referred to as type I and II Because of the identical organo-silica surface chemistry both hybrid particles have been polymer modified using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization SI-ATRP PMMA or PSAN tethers have been isotopic labeled by random copolymerization of appropriate amounts of d8-MMA or d8-S monomers in the reactant composition of the respective polymer we found the kinetics of the polymerization not to depend on isotope composition For example to accomplish contrast matching of PMMA to fully hydrogenated organo-silica particles SiO2-I a molar fraction of d8-MMA of xD  2 was applied this sample is denoted PMMA in the following Similarly xD  69 was used for the deuterated analogue SiO2-II PMMA Analogous synthesis was performed for PSAN analogs PSAN PSAN Using the strategies outlined above the following brush particle systems have been prepared 1 SiO2-I-PMMA SiO2-I-PMMA and SiO2-II-PMMA - sample ID PMMA PMMA 2 SiO2-I-PSAN and SiO2-II-PSAN - sample ID PSAN PSAN For each particle series 1 and 2 three degrees of polymerization N  100 200 and 300 have been prepared the grafting density is about constant s  02 nm-2 for the different brush particle systems Thus a total of 6 samples has been prepared about 1 g of each material system is currently available SLD matching of the respective particle brush systems has been confirmed SANS CNR NIST by evaluating the scattering strength of films with systematically varied dh composition Choice of Instrument Beam time at the CHRNS USANS BT-5 is requested for experiments on material systems a and b We plan to perform USANS of blend films  1mm thickness at various quench depth To in-situ resolve microstructure formation a hot stage capable of T variation across the range 100-170C will be required If required samples can also be annealed outside the station and rapidly cooled to the glassy state for analysis however we would prefer in-situ analysis Experiment Plan and Data Analysis The goal of this project will be to elucidate the phase separation mechanism and kinetics of particle brush blend systems as a function of blend compositions molecular characteristics N and quench depth SANS experiments will be performed as function of quench depth and time To accomplish this experiment a hot stage will be required that allows T variation in the range 100-170C The following experimental systems will be of interest Blend System 1  SiO2-I-PMMA SiO2-II-PSAN N  100 Blend System 2  SiO2-I-PMMA SiO2-II-PSAN N  200 Blend System 3  SiO2-I-PMMA SiO2-II-PSAN N  300 We expect that experiments during a first beamtime cycle will only focus on N  100 particle systems to optimize parameters A series of films with variable composition will be prepared to scan across the metastable and unstable regimes in the phase diagram Preliminary experiments on thin films suggest that domain sizes will be in the range of 300 - 800 nm however domain growth in the bulk could lead to the formation of even larger domain sizes due to the absence of pinning effects To elucidate the phase separation characteristics of brush particle blends we will be evaluated at compositions f  01 03 05 07 09 For each blend composition we plan to investigate the microstructure nucleation  growth vs spinodal as well as domain growth kinetics at two different annealing temperatures above LCST ie two distinct quench depths T1  160C and T2  180C respectively the LCST was determined in preliminary experiments to be about 150C and as a function of annealing time between t  0 and 5h however this time range will be adjusted depending on results Our analysis will proceed analog to those of linear homopolymer blends Analysis of Iq as function of annealing time t will be used to establish the kinetics of phase separation and domain size Spinodal decomposition will be confirmed by linearization of Iqq2 and extrapolation to q  0 will yield the mutual diffusion coefficient DM Analysis of Iq as function of t will furthermore yield the spinodal wavelength lmax It will be interesting to test the dependence of the lmax on the quench depth that close to the spinodal is expected to follow the relation lmax  1-TLCST-12 We are particularly interested in testing De Gennes proposal that spinodal decomposition in constrained systems De Gennes envisioned spinodal decomposition in a weakly crosslinked polymer network is characterized by an anomalous growth regime that precedes the regular diffusion-driven regime which has been widely observed in phase separating polymer blends Phase evolution in this anomalous regime is predicted to follow a time evolution with an exponent of 15 rather than 13 We Page 3 of 3 hypothesize that particle cores - because of their reduced dynamics - will present a temporary network akin to a physical crosslinked structure and thus give rise to an anomalous diffusion regime during the initial stage of phase separation Response to Previous Panel We have performed SANS experiments at CNR NIST to evaluate materials and confirm composition However limitations in flux did prevent us from elucidating domain growth We have also contacted SNS beamline scientist Ken Littrell to confirm feasibility of T-scan experiments using a hot stage Safety Considerations All materials will be in form of solid film samples that will be prepared at Carnegie Mellon University Individual materials PMMA PSAN silica do not present hazards
