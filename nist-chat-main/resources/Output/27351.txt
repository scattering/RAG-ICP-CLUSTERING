Neutron Imaging of Platinum-Group Metal-Free Cathode Fuel Cells with Engineered Solutions for Enhanced Water Management Lisa Dunsmore and Shawn Litster Carnegie Mellon University We propose to use the unique water imaging capabilities of neutron imaging to address the key challenge of water flooding in thick platinum-free fuel cell electrodes and catalyst layers by understanding the impact of novel structures and treatments for water management The thickness of these electrodes is much greater than those with Pt making the resolution of neutron radiography suitable for studying water dynamics in catalyst layers This work will be part of the CMU-led DOE ElectroCat Consortium project PI Litster on advancing electrodes for Pt-free fuel cells Polymer electrolyte fuel cells offer a means of energy conversion with zero emissions for stationary power automotive applications and numerous other power sources applications However the platinum catalyst typically used in these fuel cells does not scale like the other components of the fuel cell stack because of its raw material cost making it a significant portion of material cost especially at high production quantities Platinum-group metal-free PGM-free catalysts offer a solution by using earth abundant materials here specifically iron carbon and nitrogen However the lower volumetric activity of these catalysts requires a thicker catalyst layer which causes more liquid water accumulation blocking oxygen transport To mitigate this effect and thereby improve the efficiency and power density of these fuel cells we have developed novel cathode electrodes by exploring the use of hydrophilic and hydrophobic structures In order to pinpoint the mode of water removal in these electrodes we would like to use neutron imaging of these fuel cells at operating points that correspond to flooded and non-flooded conditions The first electrode that we would like to investigate contains a microporous layer with catalyst layer material filled perforations to create hydrophilic pathways for water removal Previous work has been done to enhance water management using perforations for platinum-based fuel cells where flooding is less severe 1- The Mench group from Penn State developed a variety of perforated electrodes which were imaged at NIST These perforations were unfilled and extended through the entire gas diffusion layer From imaging at high 17 Acm2 and low 02 Acm2 current densities as well as high and low relative humidity they were able to observe a higher water content in the perforated electrodes and periodic peaks of increased water mass indicating possible pooling locations induced by the perforations 1 Ford Motor Company also explored the effect of perforations on platinum-based electrodes using unfilled perforations in the microporous layer  Here neutron imaging from NIST enabled the observation that the perforated design resulted in a more uniform water distribution which is desirable for uniform electrochemical reaction high power density and durability Imaging techniques will be informed by this previous work but we welcome changes in the experiment at the advice of the NIST scientists The difference from these previous works is that these thick PGM-free catalyst layers have more severe flooding than platinum-based electrodes Additionally the perforations are filled with catalyst layer material which is designed to prevent high levels of water saturation in the cathode Figure 1 shows a micro-CT cross section of a membrane electrode assembly containing this perforated cathode electrode This Figure 1 Micro-CT images of a 1 mm section of the membrane electrode assembly with 500 m perforation spacing Catalyst layer material in orange fills the two perforations up to the carbon paper backing providing a path for water transport and clearing the way for O2 transport The increased interfacial area between the catalyst layer and microporous layer also enhances O2 transport perforated design results in the performance improvement observed in Figure 2 Our hypothesis is that this improvement is due to a reduction in breakthrough pressure for liquid water through the microporous layer resulting in a decrease in liquid water saturation in the catalyst layer From neutron imaging we could validate this hypothesis by comparing the water content of the perforated and non-perforated baseline electrode at a series of operating points This will also help us identify the spatial range of influence that the perforations have on the catalyst layer water content Membrane electrode assemblies for fuel cell testing will be prepared as close as possible to the time of measurement to minimize degradation of the PGM-free electrodes These take a maximum of two days to prepare and will be prepared in a way that is compatible with the fuel cell hardware at the Neutron Imaging Facility at NIST First we will condition the cells for two hours under 100 relative humidity N2 at 200 sccm on the anode and cathode at 80C with 50 kPa backpressure After conditioning we will maintain the relative humidity temperature and backpressure and apply H2 at 200 sccm on the anode and air at 1000 sccm on the cathode Galvanostatic measurements should be used in order to control the amount of water production for accurate comparison between cells We will hold the current density at 02 Acm2 for 10 min to achieve a steady state condition then record 20 images at an acquisition rate of 60 seconds per image This measurement is to evaluate a non-transport limited operating point We will repeat this imaging procedure at 04 Acm2 and 12 Acm2 to evaluate a typical operating point for these fuel cells and a transport-limited operating point respectively Once these three sets of images are taken at 100 relative humidity we will switch to N2 and reduce the humidifier temperature to 78C to reduce the relative humidity to 95 We will hold this condition for 30 minutes then apply H2 and Air as before and repeat the imaging procedure at open circuit voltage This measurement is to evaluate the case where no additional water is produced by the oxygen reduction reaction with the goal to observe the level of equilibrium water saturation in the meso- and micro-pores of the electrode where water will condense at less than 100 relative humidity Figure 2 Polarization and power density curves for in 100 RH with air at the cathode Perforation spacing of 500 um 750 um and 1000 um are compared to a baseline electrode with no perforations The increase in perforation density corresponds to an increase in maximum current density and power density These tests were conducted with 80 nm particle size catalyst through capillary condensation Then we will reduce the humidifier temperature to 68C and the backpressure to 30 kPa to change the relative humidity to 60 and hold this condition in N2 for 30 minutes We will then switch to H2 and Air and repeat the imaging procedure at open circuit voltage 02 Acm2 04 Acm2 and 12 Acm2 Lastly we will completely dry the cell and repeat the imaging procedure to get the reference dry image In total nine series of images are collected Each image series would be averaged to reduce measurement uncertainty as in  This procedure would take approximately nine hours for each electrode tested including the time required to disassemble and reassemble the cell In addition to the baseline and perforated electrode we would also like to image the following electrodes engineered for enhanced water management using the same experimental methods as stated previously in priority order The first of these uses a new catalyst layer ink formulation during fabrication to increase hydrophobicity The morphology of this electrode also contains less dense catalyst aggregates and results in higher maximum current density due to improved oxygen transport The second and third electrodes use polytetrafluoroethylene additives to increase the hydrophobicity of the catalyst layer to prevent and remove liquid water The second electrode uses a polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion that is mixed into the catalyst ink as a binder The third electrode uses expanded polytetrafluoroethylene infiltrated with catalyst ink to create a percolating hydrophobic network for water removal With an experiment time of nine hours each we are requesting three days of beam time to image four electrodes and one baseline electrode We can determine if the increase in maximum current density of these engineered electrodes is due to a reduction in saturation of the cathode catalyst layer by comparing the overall water content at each operating point to that of the baseline cell In particular for the perforated cell we can look for water mass peaks that correspond to perforation distance in the in-plane direction as in  indicating preferential water transport pathways The alignment uncertainty will be measured and we will use a perforation spacing of 750 m to ensure that the perforation spacing well exceeds any misalignment We can also look at the range of water thicknesses to compare the uniformity of the water distribution as in  The information gathered in this study can also be used to inform our computational fuel cell model by using the electrode dependent saturation to elucidate the hydrophobicity of the different electrodes Neutron imaging of PGM-free catalyst fuel cells in sync with computational fuel cell modeling could expedite a feedback loop of informed experiment optimization and efficient robust electrode design This would further develop an understanding for water management tackling one of the main challenges for PGM-free fuel cells Furthermore improved water management and PGM-free catalysts can both broadly advance the progress of fuel cell technology Please contact Lisa Dunsmore in future communications regarding this proposal at llanghorandrewcmuedu The proposed work is an essential part of Lisa
