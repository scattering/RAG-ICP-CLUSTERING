integrated inten-sity over the Yoneda wing as a func-tion of magnetic eld for a continuousFe90Zr10V70Zr3 20We would like to use Polarized Neu-tron Re ectivity PNR and o -specularPolarized Neutron Scattering PNS tostudy dynamics induced by changes inapplied eld in an amorphous multi-layered structure pattered into an ar-ray of parallel stripes Amorphousmaterials are alone interesting consid-ering it can be viewed as isotropicand exhibit good layer perfection This allows an exciting and accessi-ble route to tailor properties such asmagnetism within a layer but also be-tween adjacent layers With PNR andPNS we have con rmed that a continu-ous amorphous ferromagneticnon-magneticFe90Zr10V70Zr3 20 multilayer stack forma magnetic domain structure when sample isdemagnetized This was achieved by previously PNS measurements performed at ILL us-ing the re ectometer SuperADAM Fig 1 show obtained data for the integrated intensityover the Yoneda wing collected in the spin up-up and down-up channels as a function ofmagnetic eld As can be seen the intensity is decreasing a with eld strength indicatingexistence of magnetic domains that are disappearing when an external magnetic eld isappliedFigure 2 Sketch of the laterally pat-terned Fe90Zr10V70Zr3 20 multi-layerPatterning this multilayer system latteraly intoan array of parallel stripes rst of all intro-duces a uniaxial shape anisotropy where thestrength depends on the aspect ratio lengthvs width  The uniaxial anisotropy de- nes the easy axis parallel to the stripes whilethe hard perpendicular to the stripes lead-ing to an e ective two-fold-in-plane anisotropySecondly the patterning is introducing an an-tiferromagnetic arrangement between adjacentmagnetic layers due the stray eld originat-ing from the edges of the layers giving riseto demagnetizing elds and dipole interactionsmodifying the magnetic alignment see Fig21The o -specular polarized neutron scattering will reveal both nuclear and magnetic cor-relations due to modulation of the magnetic lateral pattern When the external appliedmagnetic eld is zero a half-order magnetic Bragg peak Q12 will appear in the intensitymap due to the antiferromagnetic arrangement in the multilayer system When the stackis ferromagnetically aligned the intensity will be redistributed to areas where scatteringarises due to the lateral pattern As the applied external eld is reduced back towardszero the intensity of the Q12-peak will increase which will resolve the strength of theinteraction between the layers and the behaviour magnetization reversal Depending onif the reversal is taking place in along the easy or hard axis the scattered intensity willbe manifested in di erent ways for the two directions By performing full spin polarizedanalysis collecting all four spin states we will be able to analyse how the direction ofthe magnetisation within the layers changes for both the easy and hard axis In additionwe will be able to investigate if there is a domain formation at the same time as we willbe able to resolve inter-island e ects We therefore consider that this experiment to bean excellent example to show the power of PNR and PNS providing more detailed in-formation than other bulk methods especially for a complex system having two arti cialperiodicitiesProposed ExperimentOur planned experiment will be concentrated on performing polarized neutron re ectivityand o -specular studies as a function of temperature and applied external magnetic eldby using MAGIK We will record di use scattering as function of both in-plane Qx andout-of-plane Qz scattering vectors in order to obtain a full reciprocal space map wherepolarised-beam measurements will be performed by using the 3He analyserWe intend to measure at two di erent temperature regimes and three external magnetic eld states We will start by measuring at room temperature were the sample is non-magnetic and the nuclearchemical specular and o -specular scattering can be obtainedNext temperature will be at below ordering temperature 10 K At this temperaturedata will be collected in zero external eld and in high eld strength where multilayerstack Fe90Zr10V70Zr3 is ferromagnetically aligned Additionally we will collect data ina small external magnetic eld of approximately 5 mT along both the easy and hard axisThis measurement will be performed to observe the di erent reversal processes for thetwo di erent directions The preparation for the experiment and temperature changeswill in total take about 1 day Each polarised specular and o -specular measurementwill take approximately 17 hours to record We therefore require a minimum of 5 daysbeamtime in order to record the full data set for the two samplesSample description and preparationThe sample for proposed experiment consists of 20 alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers see Fig 2 Both the elemental and compositional selection was thought-fully considered having in mind the large SLD contrast between Fe90Zr10 and V70Zr30 andmagnetic behaviour of the Fe90Zr10-layer The thickness of the spacer layer is well abovethe limit for any interlayer exchange coupling though the V70Zr30-layer and interactionsbetween the magentic layers can therefore be neglected  To eliminate crystallization2at the substratemultilayer interface and to protect the structure from oxidation a bu erand cap layer of Al70Zr30 has been deposited having thicknesses of 20 respectively 60 AThe second layer from the bottom is a Sm17Co83-layer deposited in an external magnetic eld applied parallel to the lm plane Sm17Co83 is a hard ferromagnet and depositing itin a magnetic eld results in an imprinted uniaxial anisotropy de ning an easy axis in theplane along the growth eld direction and a hard axis perpendicular to it Due to the softnature of Fe90Zr10 the direction of the magnetisation within each ferromagnetic layer isstrongly a ected by the imprinted anisotropy in the Sm17Co83-layer The magnetizationof the bottom Fe90Zr10-layer is pinned and therefore mediates the antiferromagnetic cou-pling between the layers On the contrary the top-most Fe90Zr10-layer is not pinned it islacking in number of neighbours and therefore experience a weaker dipole coupling Theextremity of the stack can thereby be aligned more easily to an applied eld Dependingon the eld protocol used during the experiment we therefore will obtain di erent pat-terns of the magnetic di use scattering which will tell us about the reversal mechanismwhitin the magnetic layersThe multilayer stack is deposited on a 20x20 mm2 substrates in order to have a bigscattering area It is pattered into arrays of stripes having a diameter of 5 and 10 mwith a separation of 1 m resulting in a periodicity of 6 and 11 m The size of theelements are fabricated considering obtaining both interesting magnetic e ects at thesame time as obtain su cient intensity in a reasonable time The sample will be fullycharacterized with gracing incident di raction in order to assure good amorphicity X-rayre ectivity experiments will be performed to determine the layer thickness prior to thebeamtime The magnetization will be determined as a function of temperature by usingthe longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr e ect setup along both the easy and hard axis andabsolute
