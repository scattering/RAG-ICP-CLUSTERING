are metal complexes with MS  12 or MJ  12 which by Zeeman effect split into the entangled MS  12 and MS  -12 levels2-3 For such metal complexes electron spin-spin interactions among neighboring molecules in the solids severely reduce the qubit lifetime or T2 required for QIP2 Thus 90 dilution with non-magnetic ZnII ions for CoII2 and LuIII ions for YbIII ions3 are required to reduce the interactions There is little understanding of the intermolecular spin-spin interactions in metal complexes thus limiting the selection of qubits as well as the development of single-molecule magnets SMMs4-5 SMMs are typically paramagnetic S   compounds with organic ligands separating the metal ions Unlike bulk magnetism the magnetic properties of SMMs stem from the intrinsic electronic structure of individual molecules5 However there have been questions whether certain single-molecule magnets truly behave as individual molecules Directly confirming the presence of such intermolecular interactions in SMMs is difficult Habib and coworkers have found a second relaxation process with an intermolecular nature in a CoII SMM4 and the process only disappeared in highly ZnII-diluted solids Pedersen and coworkers also needed to make 7 YbIII in 93 LuIII for an SMM which is also a qubit candidate3 Gmez-Coca and coauthors have used ZnII dilution to show that there are intermolecular interactions in SMM Coacac2H2O2 1 acac  acetylacetonate9 Typically bulk susceptibilities between undiluted and diluted samples are compared to find out whether there are intermolecular spin-spin interactions We propose to use INS to probe the intermolecular spin-spin interactions in metal complexes through the Q-dependence of the magnetic peaks To our knowledge INS has not been used to study such intermolecular interactions However such an approach has been used to study intramolecular spin-spin interactions For example using compounds with two metal ions and direct antiferromagnetic couplings Furrer and Gdel have shown that the Q-dependence of the intensities in INS gives direct information about both the form factor of the unpaired electrons and the intramolecular geometrical configuration of the magnetic ions in a metal dimer Fig 210-13 They show that for a magnetic transition S  S its INS intensity is given by Eq 1  exp   exp21    Eq 1 Fig 2 a INS of D3N5CrODCrND3Cl5 b Q

is the interference betweenamong metal ions giving the oscillatory behavior Fig 2b of the INS intensities10 12-13 as a direct picture of the metal-metal distances in the dimer10-13 The proposed work will help understand the nature of intermolecular spin-spin interactions in metal compounds A good understanding will lead to the selection of both chemical qubits and SMMs We plan to use Coacac-d72D2O2 1-d18 S  32 for the studies 1 Coacac2D2O2 1-d4 and 1-d18 have been extensively studied by us7-8 and others9 2 Preliminary Work Per-deuterated 1-d18 displays spin-phonon coupled peaks A and B in Raman Fig 3a and far-IR spectra as we recently reported7 The magnetic transition 114 cm-1 is coupled with a nearby phonon to give the spin-phonon coupled peaks at 0 T Peaks A and B in Raman appear to carry more phonon and magnetic features respectively Far-IR and Raman spectroscopies cannot reveal whether there are intermolecular interactions INS offers the unique Q dependence of scattering peaks which may show if peak B carrying more magnetic features in INS indeed displays the behavior associated with a magnetic transition from a single ion of CoII or that of interacting CoII metal centers In other words the proposed work will demonstrate if INS is capable of revealing the intermolecular interactions in 1-d18 Preliminary studies on 1-d18 were conducted with Disk Chopper Spectrometer DCS with a 10 T magnet under 0 T and 10 T8 The measuring time for each field was about 24 hrs The experiment was hindered due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of the magnet Fig 3c appears to show an oscillatory behavior expected from the F2Q 1    part in Eq 1 and observed in Fig 2b10 12-13 suggesting the presence of intermolecular interactions The observation is consistent with ZnII dilution results by Gmez-Coca and coauthors9 However the data although consistent with Raman and far-IR spectra are statistically questionable at the 3 level Fig 3b-c Better data from the proposed studies are needed to confirm our results 3 Choice of Instrument We plan to use BT-7 Double Focusing Triple-Axis Spectrometer to perform this experiment BT-7 is the proper choice of INS instrument due to the following 1 Energy range of the excitation 14 meV 113 cm-1 is suitable 2 Higher intensity of the instrument We will use the horizontal focusing option with Ef  147 meV on BT-7 together with the velocity selector in the reactor beam which was not available during the last proposal cycle as it was under Raman Shift cm-190 100 110 120 130 140Magnetic Field

will provide a clean incident beam and will therefore provide excellent signal-to-noise With the horizontal focusing option the instrument scientist estimates that the signal will be close to two orders-of-magnitude better than on DCS The velocity selector is also essential when using the Ef  5 meV option on BT-7 4 Experiment Plan The measurements will be performed with final energy Ef  147 meV 119 cm-1 at 17 K for a series of wave vectors Q to determine IQ Additional data with higher energy resolution will be obtained for the 14 meV transition by using the Ef  5 meV 40 cm-1 with a Be filter and horizontal analyzer focusing option on BT-7 Four grams of polycrystalline sample of 1-d18 will be rolled in an aluminum foil cigar before being packed in an Al sample can and sealed under helium as an exchange gas We kindly ask for 2 days of beam time at BT-7 to gather sufficient statistics for the intensity measurements and 3 days for the high resolution data for a total request of 5 days The peaks will be examined further for interference effects from the Co-Co interactions of neighboring molecules ie intermolecular interactions that Furrer and Gdel described10 5 Safety Considerations This compound is not listed in the MSDS Material Safety Data Sheet 6 Publications from the Prior NCNR Instrument Times Our past studies at BT-1 and DCS with a 10-T magnet were published in Nat Commun7 and Eur J Inorg Chem8 In addition the collaboration with Dr Craig Brown led to the publication of a review on neutron instruments for research in coordination chemistry14 References 1
