Origin of Anomalous Paramagnetism in Py-Cu Composite Spin Valves with Temperature Dependent Coupling Based on Spacer Layer Thickness Kristen Repa and Casey Miller Rochester Institute of Technology Brian Kirby NIST Center for Neutron Research Spin valves which were discovered in 1991  are of technological interest due to applications in magnetic sensors hard disk read heads and MRAM  A spin valve device consists of two ferromagnetic metals with a normal metal spacer in between One of the ferromagnetic metals is pinned by exchange biasing it with an antiferromagnet while the other is allowed to rotate freely with an external magnetic field Instead of using a normal metal we fabricated spin valves with a metal that we can study as it goes through its magnetic phase transition In a recently completed PBR experiment we examined a thermal spin valve consisting of layers with 3 variations of PyxCu1-x x  04 08 and 10 Due to the difference in Cu concentration these layers exhibit distinct ferromagnetic transition temperatures TC and saturation magnetizations The Si substrate is coated with a 500 nm thermal oxide layer followed by the 3 different PyxCu1-x layers a 16 nm x  08 free layer a 20 nm x  04 spacer layer and a 16 nm x  10 pinned layer an antiferromagnetic IrMn layer and a Ta cap The IrMn serves to pin the adjacent Py layer through exchange bias  The degree to which the rest of the sample is also biased depends on ferromagnetic coupling between the PyxCu1-x layers which is highly temperature dependent owing to the depth-dependent variations in TC At room temperature a small 1 mT field was applied antiparallel to the biasing direction following application of a large saturating field At this field and temperature the pinned layer magnetization is aligned along the biasing direction the spacer layer is not ferromagnetic and correspondingly the free layer magnetization tracks the applied field direction We then measured specular non spin-flip and spin-flip reflectivities as a function of decreasing temperature Via model fitting we determined the magnetizations magnitude M and angle with respect to the externally applied in-plane magnetic field M of each layers in-plane magnetization vector as shown in Figure 1 bottom We observe a sharp transition at T  160 K corresponding to coupling of the x  10 and x  08 layers as T moves below TC of the x  04 spacer layer and long-range order is established in the spacer leading to a spontaneous reorientation of the free layer Note that the TC for the outer layers of the spin valve are well-above the Figure 1 Magnetization vs temperature top normalized at 80 K middle and angle with respect to externally applied in-plane magnetic field vs temperature bottom for 3 magnetic layers in the spin valve structure previously measured on the PNR at NIST Gaithersburg TC for the spacer layer Curiously we observe a significant non-zero magnetization in the x  04 spacer layer above that transition For this paramagnetic region of the phase diagram such behavior is unexpected as a field-induced magnetization should be strongly temperature-dependent which is inconsistent with what we observe Possible explanations include Py clusters in the nominally x  04 alloy layer andor proximity effects due to the high magnetization outer layers The magnetization of the low x spacer layer is tiny compared to that of the other two layers see top of Figure 1 and as such its temperature dependence is essentially impossible to resolve with standard magnetometry Thus to explore proximity effects in the spacer we used subsequent PBR beamtime to examine a series of similar thermal spin valves with different spacer layer thicknesses We measured non spin-flip scattering well below 50 K and well above the nominal TC 250 K To maximize paramagnetic signal we measured with an applied field of 3 T along the IrMn biasing direction in such a saturating state no spin-flip measurements were required With the allotted time we were able to obtain magnetization vs temperature for a control sample homogeneous layer of Py04Cu06 listed as x40 and the spacer layer in spin valves with 2 different spacer layer thicknesses Figure 2 Interestingly we found that proximity effects play an extremely important role For a 71 nm spacer MT looks very similar to that of the homogeneous control sample However for a 13 nm spacer TC of the spacer is drastically enhanced Further the magnetic depth profiles determined from model fitting not shown reveal no evidence that the proximity induced enhancement of the spacer layer evolves in a depth dependent fashion - ie the data at all conditions for all samples are consistent with completely uniform spacer magnetic depth profiles Figure 3 Cartoon of the spin valve structures left and exchange bias field vs temperature for each spin valve right Thicknesses on the right side correspond to the spacer layer Py04Cu06 thickness Figure 2 Spacer layer MT curves at high field and low field for different spacer layer thicknesses DC magnetometry reveals that spin valves with spacer layers x  04 of different thicknesses show a feature that looks like a blocking temperature well below the TN of IrMn that shifts with the spacer layer thickness Figure 3 This result combined with the MT from our previous PNR beamtime indicate that were able to enhance the ferromagnetic order throughout the entire spacer layer by placing it in between the two strong ferromagnets on the edges Given that the exchange length in Permalloy is approximately 5 nm it is somewhat surprising that we see such a significant and uniform enhancement across a 13 nm spacer Additionally we appear to be sensitive to a modest enhancement even in the 71 nm spacer sample To better understand this phenomenon and what role the spacer layer thickness plays we need to complete measurements over a wider range of spacer thicknesses 35 nm 7 nm and 35 nm Specifically we want to determine how the TC enhancement scales with spacer thickness We propose to continue these measurements on the remaining samples in this set We expect scans on each sample to take 2 days thus we request 6 days of beamtime References  B Dieny VS Speriosu SS Parkin BA Gurney DR Wilhoit D Mauri Phys Rev B 43 1 1991  Vinod Kumar Joshi Engineering Science and Technology an International Journal 19 1503-1513 2016  W H Meiklejohn and C P Bean Phys Rev 105 904 1957
