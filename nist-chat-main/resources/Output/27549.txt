Title Polymer Thin-Film Expansion During Static and Dynamic Electrolyte Infusion Investigator Dr Jamie L Weaver Material Measurement Laboratory NIST Collaborators Laisuo Su Carnegie Mellon University Prof B Reeja Jayan Carnegie Mellon University Dr Joseph Dura NIST Center for Neutron Research Introduction - Select chemistries of intrinsically conducting polymer thin films ICP-TFs can significantly improve solid electrodeliquid electrolyte battery cell performance by maintaining a cells high energy density  The polymer which can be applied directly as a thin film to the cathode material works as an electrodeelectrolyte interface and mitigates formation of a solid electrolyte interphase SEI A failure factor for these thin films is expansion and subsequent delamination andor tearing of the polymer following exposure to liquid electrolytes or upon application of a voltage bias  Knowledge of conditions under which novel chemistries andor preparations of ICP-TFs may expand and fail is needed for general assessment of their usefulness in commercial battery cells However measuring expansion of ICP-TFs by traditional methods eg ellipsometry can be difficult due to the light absorbing properties of the polymers  Other methods such as reflectometry must therefore be employed In this proposed work neutron reflectometry NR and x-ray reflectometry XRR will be used to determine expansion and density changes in a series of novel low temperature CVD deposited polymer thin films under ambient and electrochemical exposure to a Li electrolyte Background - In 2019 our team measured the density and thickness of three novel low temperature CVD deposited polymer thin films with neutron reflectometry Figure 1 Those studies were completed on as deposited polymers and did not include samples which had been exposed to electrolyte or electrochemical cycling In this follow-up study we would like to measure the same polymers after exposure to electrolyte and after application of a potential bias Our newly proposed studies will allow for measurement of a polymer films expansion and associated SLD change due the uptake of Li and or electrolyte molecules such as solvent or anions under ambient conditions and when a voltage is applied Knowledge of novel deposited polymers expansion upon electrolyte exposure will provide needed insight into the stressstrain interaction of the polymer coatings with underlying materials eg electrode material If a polymer expands too much it can tear or delaminate enabling direct contact between the electrolyte and electrode and formation of unwanted formation of an SEI Failure of coatings in this manner have been previously reported for PEDOT  and expansion can range from a few percent to almost 100 of the original films volume  Preliminary results from ellipsometry measurements of lithiated polymers by our team suggest that the low temperature CVD thin-films can increase in size by  23 to  26 for PEDOT and PDVB respectively Table 1 However due to the light absorbing nature of PEDOT we believe that these ellipsometry results are underdetermining the expansion of the PEDOT film Furthermore we would like to determine if the expansion and resultant composition profile is uniform or if there are interfacial layers Therefore repeating these measurements using neutron reflectometry is vital Knowing the total expansion and possible failure of these polymers at both open circuit and with applied potential is important as these polymers are designed to be used in stored and active battery cells Figure 1 - Fit experimental NR data previously collected on the unlithiated polymer thin-films Separate experiments for polymer expansion under both conditions are thus needed The two conditions can result in different total expansions because the applied bias can cause more lithium to infiltrate a polymer layer than would under ambient conditions Proposed Work - In this proposed study the three types of polymer thin-films previously analyzed as deposited by our team will be measured by NR and XRR before and after lithiation The goal of the reflectometry measurements is to quantify how much the SLD and thickness of the polymers changes upon exposure to a lithium electrolyte and after biasing A secondary goal will be to determine whether there are interfacial layers formed upon lithiation Initial samples for all studies will be polymers deposited onto sputtered Pt thin films Pt will be the electrode for the dynamic lithiation experiments The Pt layer will be deposited on a thick SiO2 layer supported by a Si wafer Prior to exposure the samples will be analyzed by XRR and NR to determine initial layers structure The samples will be measured under inert gas conditions Neutron Reflectivity The combined use of NR and XRR will taking advantage of the differences in the neutron scattering length densities and x-ray scattering length densities of Pt SiO2 and the polymers listed in Table 2 Additionally longer count times with higher statistics can be made on the polymer coated samples with neutrons as opposed to x-rays as the polymers can undergo a chemical change with prolonged exposure to x-rays All as deposited samples be measured under inert conditions He as several of the samples can undergo oxidation reactions upon contact with air All studies of samples exposed to electrolyte at open circuit potential will be analyzed under wet conditions This is necessary as the electrolyte can crystalize upon drying and would result in the formation of a too-rough-for-reflectometry sample with the roughness coming from the crystalline material Running the under wet conditions will aid in avoiding this issue The studies at applied bias will be also be completed in-situ with constant voltage being applied and NR data is being collected after the current decays to negligible levels Electrochemical measurements of test samples prior to the NR determine the lowest applied potential that can be achieved A total of 8 days of NR beamtime is requested for these experiments 2 days to measure all 3 samples as deposited in front-reflection mode in an inert environment before lithiation 3 days each to measure the 3 samples in back reflection in a wet cell filled with electrolyte The first measurement will be at open circuit after equilibrating for at least 24 hrs 3 days for 3 samples followed by in-situ studies of the samples at applied potential The wet cell measurements will require 24 hours each Corresponding XRR studies will be completed on the SiSiO2Pt supports before polymer deposition and post-deposition to obtain complementary structural information of the layers which can be utilized in the fitting of the NR data XRR will be completed at the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology NIST NR and XRR data reduction will be completed and Reductus  and data processing in Refl1D  Quality of fits will be determined by 2 and relative differences between calculated Bayesian Information Criteria BIC values  Table 1 -
