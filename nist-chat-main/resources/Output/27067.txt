Drug-Induced Morphology Switch in Excipient Systems C Lim A Kabanov UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill STeixeira Dept Chemical  Biomolecular Engineering U Delaware Newark Scientific background and Preliminary data Drug formulation is a crucial issue in pharmaceutical technology To minimize the administered amount and limit toxicity high loading capacity and solubility of the excipient are critical for poorly water-soluble drugs Polymeric micelles play an important role in nanomedicine as highly versatile drug delivery systems where wormlike micelles are of particular interest for their enhanced circulation time in vivo We recently produced Wan et al 2018 micelles using an amphiphilic triblock copolymer based on poly2-oxazoline that solubilize unprecedented high loading contents of potent anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel etoposide ETO bortezomib and vismodegib Fig1 Clear effects of the incorporated drug were observed on the morphology and overall stability of the delivery system Using a combination of SANS and TEM data we now aim to analyze the structure and stability of related polymeric nanoparticles targeting pharmacokinetic drug properties of interest Our preliminary SANS data recently collected at the NCNR see fig 2 shows a clear dependency on the formulation method and the drug feeding ratio consistent with previous observations on similar worm-structure polymeric micelles Shultz et al 2014 The scattering from the samples with the lowest drug loading 101 Vismodegib can be approximately fit with a polydisperse core-shell sphere model with a core of 327  004  radius a thickness of 381  004  and polydispersity indices of 016 and 007 respectively As more drug is loaded the micelle correlation peak  003 -1 becomes more pronounced Figure 1 TEM images of Etoposide C6-cisplatin or both drugs co-loaded in micelles Wan et al 2018 For our system depending on the nature of the drug the micelle size can be increased or decreased and incorporated drugs shift the balance between spherical and wormlike structures Wan et al 2018 The scale bar is 100 nm Figure 2 LEFT Preliminary SANS data on solutions of drug-loaded micelles 101 102 and 104 micelles have increasing drugmicelle ratios The 101 sampl Data were collected at the NG7SANS instrument NCNR NIST at room temperature 22C for solutions that were over 3 days-old The total data collection time required per sample was ca 1h RIGHT Fit to the micelle structures with lowest drug loading using a core-shell model with scattering length densities SLDcore  1x10-6 -2 SLDshell  55x10-6 -2 Our preliminary results show small particle dimensions than observed by TEM Although experimental artifacts cannot be ruled out at this point there is likely insufficient contrast between the outer shell layer and the solvent D2O due to loose packing and strong hydration This is consistent with the presence of the drug between the inner part of the shell and the core calculated SLDdrug  2x10-6 -2 as previously observed by others for other excipients Jaksch et al 2016 Proposed experiment and justification of beamtime Detailed information on the micellar size shape inner structure and correlation as well as the changes upon incorporation of the drug are essential to complement our TEM investigations SANS measurements in solution rule out effects from preparation steps such as drying freezing and staining which are needed to do TEM Furthermore SANS is sensitive to the differences in scattering length density of the various components enabling the possibility of contrast studies Finally SANS data is an average over a large sample volume in contrast to TEM and the results are thus statistically relevant We now have at hand a toolbox of formulation protocols and stoichiometries that we can deploy to favor the worm-like micelle conformations To rationalize our semi-empirical protocols and in preparation for follow-up in-situ studies at various temperatures we propose to determine the structure of a series of 4 drugs at 4 different stoichiometries 16 samples We will also collect data on the drug-free micelles for comparison 1 sample The samples will be prepared in solutions at 2 different contrasts 17x2 samples 100 D2O and 50 D2O we expect the SLD for the drug to be approximately matched at the latter Taking the measurements for solvent into consideration this amounts to 36 samples Our preliminary measurements in D2O indicate that 1h is sufficient per sample Our preliminary SANS data for some of the drug stoichiometries not shown showed a steep upturn at low-q indicative of the presence of larger metastable aggregates coexisting with well-formed micelles Our TEM data also indicates polydispersity for some of the samples depending on their age and storage temperature We will measure data on samples in D2O that have been pre-annealed at 60C for 24h 17 samples a procedure previously observed to successfully clear aggregates for similar types of micelles Ivanova et al 2008 important to improve the accuracy of our data fitting We estimate a total of 3 days are required for the measurements we propose which also takes into consideration background measurements The q range of interest 1x10-3 to 05 -1 is accessible to the 30m instruments at the NCNR or the VSANS instrument where even lower-q can be used to probe the presence of larger aggregates References Ivanova R  Komenda T  Bonn T B Ldtke K  Mortensen K  Pranzas P K Jordan R and Papadakis C M 2008 Macromol Chem Phys 209 2248-2258
