Understanding molecular orientation in ferroelectric croconic acid thin films Background Croconic acid CA is the first reported single component organic ferroelectric molecule with a high ferroelectric polarization  20 Ccm2 at room temperature comparable with the traditional inorganic ferroelectric materials  promising alternatives to traditional ferroelectrics because organics are more flexible scalable environmentally friendly and cheaper than their traditional ferroelectric counterparts Future miniaturization of electronics and information storage capabilities require device elements to be fabricated as small as possible Consequently fabricating ultra-thin film of CA is the first step toward this goal Unfortunately no studies have yet been reported out on fabricating uniform and smooth ultra-thin ferroelectric films at an ultrathin several nm limit  although progress is being made in this direction 3  with high-quality films in the 10s of nm range produced through evaporative methods with various in situ conditions For example we have demonstrated that a high in situ electric field applied during thermal evaporation results in a smooth and uniform CA film 20 nm thick due to the high polarity of the CA molecule as seen in Ref  and Fig 1 Fig 1 Effect of an in situ electric field on the CA film formation on SiO2 surface a The vapor deposition system in UHV system with electric field setup b AFM image of CA film prepared with no electric field c AFM image of CA film prepared with 5kVcm electric field d 1-D profile of AFM images  Building on these findings we are continuing to deposit CA films using choice of substrate and the application of an in situ electric field to optimize the films structural uniformity and ferroelectric properties We anticipate that higher ordering of the CA molecules will correlate with both more uniform films and higher polarizations Aim Here we aim to use neutron reflectometry to study the interface between CA films and substrates and identify any connection between the structure of the interface and the uniformity of the bulk of the film Previously we have used positron annihilation spectroscopy particularly Doppler broadening energy spectroscopy DBES to detect voids at the CAsubstrate interface  Results comparing CA on Si and SiO2 are shown in Fig 2 The S parameter is proportional to the defect concentration at a given depth with a noticeable difference at the interface for the two samples This is likely interpreted by the CA forming H-bonds with the O atoms at the SiO2 surface resulting in a higher adherence and lower defects with that substrate We aim to understand what effect this has on the molecular orientation of the CA at the interface and through the bulk of the film which could be observed as differences in the scattering length density of the films Fig 2 a DBES spectrum of CA films on Si and SiO2 substrates b Schematic diagram of CA on a SiO2 surface  Therefore we plan to use neutron reflectometry to obtain a scattering length density profile across CA films on different substrates and as a function of electric field applied during deposition Thus far this has been hard to quantify as the local tools available are insufficient for these studies in that they only yield information about surface topography eg AFM or bulk functional properties eg PFM electrical measurements DBES was able to shine some light on the concentration of defects in the films and at the filmsample interface and neutron reflectometry will highly complement these measurements As the film material is chemically constant across all samples the reflectometry measurements will yield information about interfacial roughness which can be correlated with DBES data and molecular density which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding about the alignment of CA molecules in each sample Proposed Experiment We plan to use unpolarized neutron reflectometry to measure six samples 20 nm thick CA films on Si SiO2 and Au substrates with samples deposited with and without an electric field applied in situ Reflectometry measurements can be performed at ambient conditions as the samples are relatively stable over time The samples have been prepared on substrates that are 10 cm  10 cm in size We anticipate that we will be able to measure out to relatively high Q value 018  by scanning roughly 12 hours for each sample Therefore we request 3 days for this experiment in order to measure 6 samples Preliminary Results CA films have been prepared using thermal evaporation with powder purchases from Sigma-Aldrich evaporated in a crucible at 130C under ultra high vacuum of 20 x 10-7 torr Films were deposited in commercially obtained Si SiO2 and ultra flat Au deposited on Si substrates both with and without the application of an applied electric field during deposition Details of the applied electric field can be found in Ref 3 Both Fig 1 and 2 show recent results of our samples demonstrating an enhanced film uniformity with applied electric field also demonstrated in Ref 5 All samples are characterized with atomic force microscopy to determine their surface topography and roughness DBES results already indicate differences between films deposited on different substrates especially at the interface While DBES studies were performed only on films on Si and SiO2 we also anticipate further differences on films deposited on Au especially because the hydrophobic nature of the Au will lead to differences in how the organic molecules adhere to the surface Additionally local collaborators have performed molecular dynamics simulations on the CAAu interface predicting a difference in molecular orientation when an electric field is applied during deposition Fig 3 References  Horiuchi S Tokunaga Y Giovannetti G Picozzi S Itoh H Shimano R Kumai R Tokura Y Above-room-temperature ferroelectricity in a single-component molecular
