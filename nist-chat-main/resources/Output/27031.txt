Background The search for antiferromagnetic systems that exhibit exotic ground states has been one of the most attractive areas in experimental condensed matter physics Recently our group has been studying the magnetic properties of a non-centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic system -Cu2V2O7 which surprisingly reveals the nonreciprocal magnons caused by the incompatibility between anisotropic exchange and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya DM interactions  The underlying physics of this system has been studied thoroughly particularly in its magnetic properties macroscopically and microscopically We therefore extend our investigation to its cousin phase -Cu2V2O7 Copper pyrovanadate can be typically formed in two distinct crystal structures ie -Cu2V2O7 and -Cu2V2O7 Although the magnetic structure and magnetic properties of -Cu2V2O7 have been studied extensively 1- the thorough study of -Cu2V2O7 is still scarce Both systems are believed to have different magnetic properties since in the former the DM interaction is present whereas the latter does not have such antisymmetric interactions between the nearest-neighbor Cu2 ions due to symmetry of the underlying crystal structure It has long been proposed that the magnetic network of -Cu2V2O7 with the presence of further-neighbor interactions could be realized as a spin-12 anisotropic honeycomb lattice 7- Although the co-linear antiferromagnetic interactions of spins in the honeycomb structure itself is un-frustrated however when the second or third nearest neighbors are taken into account magnetic frustration can emerge leading to the spin liquid state 9-1 The -phase of Cu2V2O7 is therefore a new candidate for this type of magnetic structure In order to understand the magnetic behavior of this system it is essential to determine the magnetic structure with the essential of powder neutron scattering technique It has been suggested from magnetization study on the single crystal sample that the c-axis is the easy axis with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions 1 Our preliminary irreducible representation analysis based on the H-M notation space group C12c1 and the magnetic translation vector k  000 resulted in four irreps of dimension 1 Since c-axis is the easy axis and assume that nearest-neighbor interaction is the leading coupling with non-negligible third-neighbor interaction in order to form the honeycomb network we thus presume that the magnetic symmetry of -Cu2V2O7 can be represent by the Shubnikov space group C12c1 This preliminary analysis could be confirmed by the powder neutron scattering It is worth noted that up to date there has been no report on the high purity powder sample of -Cu2V2O7 even though the phase transition between the - and -phase can alternatively be Figure 1 Rietveld refinement on the powder x-ray diffraction pattern of -Cu2V2O7 controlled by doping copper sites with zinc 21 We believe that the difficulty was due to the complex phase diagram of Cu2V2O7 We however were able to prepare high purity powder sample of both -Cu2V2O7 and Zn015Cu185V2O7 The powder x-ray diffraction with the Rietveld refinement of -Cu2V2O7 is shown in Fig1 whereas the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature is shown in Fig2 The Curie-Weiss fit to its inverse magnetic susceptibility yielded the Curie temperature of -8533 K indicating the dominating antiferromagnetic exchange interaction The magnetic property studies of -Cu2V2O7 is still scarce and the magnetic structure is still unknown We therefore propose to study the magnetic structure of -Cu2V2O7 in comparison with our previous granted proposal 26023 on Zn015Cu185V2O7 for a deep understanding on the magnetic network of these systems Proposed measurements In this experiment we will perform the neutron powder diffraction measurements on the pure -Cu2V2O7 at 3 K and 50 K ie above and below the Neel temperature of 26 K in order to observe the magnetic Bragg peaks We expect that the intensity of magnetic peaks from the ordered Cu2 ions is supposedly low as we have experienced from -Cu2V2O7 Therefore we choose Ge 311 as a monochromator without collimators to maximize the intensity We also expect to do the measurements with a long counting time to maximize the statistic We thus request a total of 2 days of beam time at BT1 for these measurements References  G Gitgeatpong Y Zhao P Piyawongwatthana Y Qiu L W Harriger N P Butch T J Sato and K Matan Phys Rev Lett 119 047201 2017  J Pommer V Kataev K-Y Choi P Lemmens A Ionescu Y Pashkevich A Freimuth and G Guntherodt Phys Rev B 67 214410 2003  J Sannigrahi S Bhowal S Giri S Majumdar and I Dasgupta Phys Rev B 91 220407R 2015  G Gitgeatpong Y Zhao M Avdeev R O Piltz T J Sato and K Matan Phys Rev B 92 024423 2015  A Banerjee J Sannigrahi S Bhowal I Dasgupta S Majumdar H C Walker A Bhattacharyya and D T Adroja Phys Rev B 94 144426 2016  G Gitgeatpong M Suewattana Shiwei Zhang A Miyake M Tokunaga P Chanlert N Kurita H Tanaka T J Sato Y Zhao and K Matan Phys Rev B 95 245119 2017  A A Tsirlin O Janson and H Rosner Phys Rev B 82 144416 2010  O Janson A A Tsirlin J Sichelsschmidt Y Skourski F Weickert and H Rosner Phys Rev B 83 094435 2011  P W Anderson Science 235 1196 1987 1 D C Cabra C A Lamas and H D Rosales Phys Rev B 83 094506 2011 1 Z He and Y Ueda Phys Rev B 77 052402 2008 1 B Chattopadhyay Md A Ahmed S Bandyopadhyay R Singh and P Mandal J Apply Phys 121 094103 2017 Figure 2 Magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature and its inverse of -Cu2V2O7 powder sample The Curie-Weiss fit yields Curie temperature of -8533 K
