Structural analysis of viral single-stranded DNA for optimization of DNA nanotechnology Joseph Robertson Jacob Majikes Michael Zwolak and J Alexander Liddle Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division National Institute of Standards and Technology Objective Structural DNA nanotechnology and DNA origami in particular is a self-assembly-driven bottom up nanofabrication method for creating intricate nanostructures for a wide variety of applications The challenges in characterizing and understanding the assembly process limit the efficacy of scaling structures up in size and increasing yield for difficult to fold structures We will address these limitations by making fundamental measurements on the structural and dynamical variations of the central molecule to DNA origami the approximately 7200 base-pair bp cyclic single-stranded ssDNA viral DNA from the M13 bacteriophage ie the template SANS and USANS data will be obtained under a variety of key conditions including DNA concentration Mg2 concentration and temperature and analyzed to understand the nature of inter- and intra- molecular interactions intrinsic to the template and which compete with programmed folding This data will be further analyzed with coarse-grained molecular models and expected secondary structure ie intramolecular complementarity to generate a comprehensive model for the energetics and distribution of molecular size This work will be combined with further measurements to extract information on the dynamical structure of these molecules using other methods including neutron spin-echo spectroscopy Introduction Structural DNA nanofabrication is an emerging self-assembly technique that utilizes the well-understood properties of DNA hybridization with relatively inexpensive DNA synthesis of arbitrary sequence to design systems which fold into predesigned 2D and 3D structures 1 see Fig 1 DNA origami the typical and currently most viable DNA nanofabrication technique routes a large 7 kilobase viral circular ssDNA into a predesigned structure through programmed base pairing folds with synthetic oligomers staples While DNA origami design is relatively easy the details of its assembly processes are notoriously difficult to examine 1 and hinder the design of more robust structuresfold routing This is in part due to the complication of existing secondary structure within the M13 viral scaffold By nature this secondary structure competes with the origami folding This secondary structure is also biologically relevant for M13 and the closely related fd phage 2 There is evidence that DNA secondary structure in ssDNA bacteriophage can provide signals for RNA polymerase 3 or incision by the phage fd gene II-protein 4 It also has been shown to function as a set of morphogenetic signals over the lifetime of the fd phage 5 It is increasingly clear that the dynamics of secondary and tertiary structure play an important role in biological function The M13 bacteriophage which infects E Coli is a well-known model system in this context 5 It is particularly interesting that under biologically relevant conditions any individual hairpin is only 50  to be folded at any time This is a promising indicator that the folding and unfolding of secondary structure contains meaningful information With relevance in both biology and nanotechnology it is an ideal candidate for examining properties of this intrinsic secondary structure Preliminary Results Initial experiments were designed to measure the change of the hydrodynamic radius Rh of M13 with the inclusion of Mg2 ions at room temperature Since DNA has a highly charged primary structure the electrostatic Figure 1 Example of DNA origami structure repulsion does not allow stable secondary structures to form without proper screening Mg2 is very effective at shielding the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA backbone and thus encourages stable secondary structure With increased Mg2 concentration base-pair formation becomes a dominant structural motif and secondary structures both stable and dynamic can form Dynamic light scattering DLS experiments show that in the absence of Mg2 the 7200 base single stranded DNA loop adopts a relatively large Rh of 40 nm A regularization analysis estimates a polydispersity of apparent Rh on the order of 75  suggesting that the molecule is both self-repulsive and highly variant in its dynamic size As Mg2 is added to the system the Rh is initially approximately constant and then decreases monotonically reaching a minimum value at approximately 10 mM As the Rh decreases the dispersity of the radius decreases commensurately This suggests that either a dominant structure is being locked in or more likely the ensemble has universal characteristic substructures which will be modeled in the course of this work Cursory examination of the nucleic acid sequence suggests several regions that are expected to have significant base-pairing which will create loops and complex structures on the order of several nanometers which should produce resolvable scattering within the accessible q range of the SANS instrumentation While it is likely that these changes are indicative of nanoscale structures in thermal equilibrium with the environment the molecular details are not accessible with visible light To access the critical lengths necessary to understand these molecular dynamics preliminary small angle neutron scattering SANS experiments were performed on M13 DNA both with and without Mg2 Figure 3 shows SANS scattering curves at a relatively high 025 wt  of DNA in a modified TE buffer The data both with and without Mg2 show significant interparticle interactions with a slope of Q24 at low q The magnitude and nature of this interaction will be studied by reducing DNA concentration between to as low as 00025 wt  to see the evolution of DNA structure as the crowding regime is altered To quantitatively assess the data in Fig 3 various shape independent models were assessed with only the correlation length model providing an adequate fit In the correlation length model 6 intermolecular and intramolecular interactions are separated into Porod and Lorentzian-like scattering functions and fit with a combined model This can disentangle effects of self-interactions and local stiffness of the polymer from crowding-type interactions Figure 4 highlights the most significant observations from the preliminary trial Figure 4A shows the evolution of the cluster strength calculated from the Porod

without Mg2 with the Mg2 containing sample changing at nearly three times the rate More interestingly Fig 4B shows the correlation length of the DNA Without Mg2 present the nucleic acid interaction is a relatively stiff 65 nm which suggests that the single stranded DNAs stiffness still dominated by the backbone charge repulsion When Mg2 is present charge repulsion is no longer dominant and the structure of the polymer is controlled by base-pair interactions and base stacking which presents a semi-persistent 3-dimensional structure As the temperature is increased these secondary structures are melted and the correlation length decreases likely due to unstructured coiling of the polymer Experimental We propose to investigate two major factors in the organization and structure of the viral DNA template We intend to investigate the structural changes that can be found by altering crowding The crowding experiment will be done by changing the DNA concentration 00025 wt  0025 wt  and 1 wt  with magnesium concentrations at 0 mM 2 mM and 125 mM Furthermore we will probe the thermodynamics of these interactions measuring at up to 10 discrete temperatures to understand the role of hybridization and stacking These temperatures will be across the range where dynamic light scattering experiments and complimentary fluorescence melting assays 7 suggest the largest changes should be found If we allot 1 h of integration per sample in the middle and high concentration range and 2 h to 4 h of integration for the low concentration sample we should be able to complete this experiment
