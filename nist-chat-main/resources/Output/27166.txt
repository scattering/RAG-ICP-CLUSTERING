Crystal Structure of a Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskite Introduction Two-dimensional metal halide perovskites MHPs have been intensively studied in recent years for their attractive optoelectronic properties and high device stability 1 The high device performances of MHPs result from their unique properties such as changeable bandgap and high light absorption 3 The phenylethyl-ammonium lead iodide PEA2PbI4 PEAC6H5CH2CH2NH3 room-temperature crystal structure  shown in Fig 1A is typical example among this class of materials which possesses an average power conversion efficiency PCE of  145 retains 92 of its initial PCE after 1000 hrs of exposure to ambient conditions relative humidity 40  5 and shows no efficiency loss after thermal testing at 150   The optoelectronic properties of such materials are intimately related to the organic cations Thus tuning the configuration of the organic cations could give a great enlightenment on the device optimization Proposed Research In the proposed research we are going to investigate the crystal structure of a new two-dimensional metal halide perovskite mPEA2PbI4 mPEACH3C6H5CH2CH2NH3 cation shown in Fig 1B Combined with DFT calculations of the electronic band structures and photoluminescence measurements we expect to figure out how the extra carbon group affects the stack of the organic cation layer and the optoelectronic properties We have performed neutron diffraction measurements on PEA2PbI4 at 20 K 400 K and 500 K using POWGEN at ORNL and are in the process of analysing the data In order to make a good comparison we would like to perform the diffraction measurements at the same three temperatures using BT-1 on our new sample We estimate that the measurements will take at least 3 days thus we request 4 days of BT-1 beamtime in total taking the sample loading and temperature changing time into account References Fig 1 A Crystal structure of PEA2PbI4 at room temperature B Schematic configuration of mPEA cation  H Tsai et al High-efficiency two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite solar cells Nature 536 312-316 2016  J Yin et al Excitonic and polaronic properties of 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites ACS Energy Letters 2 417-423 2017  M R Filip et al Steric engineering of metal-halide perovskites with tunable optical band gaps Nature Communications 5 5757 2014  S De Wolf et al Organometal halide perovskites sharp optical absorption edge and its relation to photovoltaic performance J Phys Chem Lett 5 1035-1039 2014  Ke-zhao et al Two-dimensional lead halide-based hybrid perovskites templated by acene-alkylamines crystal structures optical properties and piezoelectricity Inorg Chem 56 9291-9302 2017  K Lee et al A highly stable and efficient carbon electrode-based perovskite solar cell achieved via interfacial growth of 2D PEA2PbI4 perovskite J Mater Chem A 6 24560 2018
