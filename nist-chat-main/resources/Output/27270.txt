vehicle BEV adoption will remain limited until concerns about insufficient range and recharge rate are ameliorated 1 The US Department of Energy DOE reports that enabling extreme fast charging XFC may be a single path for overcoming these shortcomings simultaneously targeting the addition of 200 miles of driving range in a 10 minute charge 1 No BEV on the market today is capable of meeting this demand Fast charging predisposes a Li-ion battery with a graphite anode to a host of undesirable side effects Graphite stores Li ions by intercalation but at higher charging rates Li plating onto graphite surfaces becomes more thermodynamically favorable due to large anodic overpotentials 2 Additionally thermal gradients can arise within the battery during fast charging 1 Our group has previously demonstrated that inter-electrode thermal gradients in a specific direction Tanode  Tcathode can induce and exacerbate lithium plating 3 4 Li plating on the graphite surface is not only the source of battery capacity loss and electrode diffusion resistance but it can also pose a significant threat to battery and operator safety via formation of internal short circuits Additionally the morphology and type of Li plating film-like mossy dendritic is considered to have implications on battery safety as well as plating reversibility Figure 1 A Battery capacity retention vs cycle number

plated lithium and restore battery capacity which can mitigate the consequences of XFC External thermal gradients where Tanode  Tcathode may be used to either prevent lithium metal plating on the graphite anode entirely or to restore battery health after inadvertent Li plating has been detected following an XFC event In Figure 1A we show capacity loss after inducing Li plating blue data points followed by enhanced recovery of plated Li using an applied external thermal gradient Tanode  Tcathode compared to isothermal ambient cycling Our hypothesis for the recovery of Li plating is represented schematically in Figure 1B Figure 1C shows unique Li plating morphologies as a function of cathode loading which we expect to have implications on recovery by external thermal gradients Despite the promise that external thermal gradients hold for enabling XFC the mechanism for metallic lithium stripping and recovery by this type of control is not yet well understood Neutron imaging can improve the understanding of lithium plating exacerbated by XFC and ultimately Li-ion battery safety In our work so far the presence of metallic Li plating has been supported by dVdQ analysis electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS and X-ray computed tomography CT Though this suite of characterization provides convincing electrochemical evidence of Li plating and subsequent recovery it is not capable of providing direct visual confirmation of Li plating spatial orientation of Li plating in the electrode or Li morphology and growth depth Neutron imaging experiments can help answer these remaining questions to vastly improve our understanding of lithium plating verifying our electrochemistry data and elucidating the mechanism for plated Li recovery to enable XFC via novel external thermal control Proposed experiment Graphite lithium iron phosphate LFP pouch cells will be constructed for these experiments We will trigger Li plating in the anodes of these cells by imposing a negative thermal gradient across the cell Tanode  Tcathode which plates Li reproducibly 3 The single-layer pouch cell form factor will be the most amenable to high-resolution neutron imaging Cell formation cycling to trigger Li plating dVdQ and EIS will be conducted prior to arrival at NIST for electrochemical confirmation that large amounts of Li have been plated on the cell anode We propose using neutron imaging to visualize a cell immediately after failure to verify Li plating in order to establish a baseline for the worst-case scenario from fast charging With neutron imaging we will visually confirm the presence of plated Li prove its spatial orientation correlate visual observations to our electrochemistry data for future diagnostics and identify regions in the graphite with lesser degrees of Li intercalation to determine how solid-state diffusion of Li-ions may exacerbate Li plating The neutron imaging capabilities at NIST will prove the effectiveness of two separate strategies employed to mitigate Li plating after it has been diagnosed either resting at OCV or cycling at lower rates with an applied external thermal gradient Tanode  Tcathode In situ Li visualization by neutron imaging in the pouch cell before and after recovery attempts will improve the current understanding on the reversibility of Li plating and the long-term consequences on battery health from XFC These results will allow us to tailor battery thermal management strategies for XFC in order to avoid Li plating and guide our efforts to optimize Li plating recovery via external thermal gradients Experimental details Three different pouch cells with identical construction and cell components will be studied at NIST In all three pouch cells we will induce lithium plating to understand the effects of XFC and how batteries subjected to these conditions may be safely restored using novel chargedischarge conditions The three triggered pouch cells will be visualized as follows 1 Cell with Li plating no attempt to recover plated Li 05 day with 15 m detector 1 day with 2 m detector 2 Cell with Li plating that has been allowed to rest for several days at OCV to passively recover plated Li 05 day with 15 m detector 1 day with 2 m detector 3 Cell in which Li plating has been recovered by novel thermal control during chargedischarge Tanode  Tcathode 05 day with 15 m detector 1 day with 2 m detector All cells will be visualized first with the 15 m detector to determine the global extent of Li plating and to identify areas of interest for subsequent higher resolution neutron imaging We will use the 2 m detector to probe three smaller areas of interest 3x4 mm field of view per pouch cell 8 hr per scan The data and conclusions from this study will be presented at technical conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals These results will also directly inform our modeling efforts to better understand the mechanisms for Li plating and recovery from fast-charging Anticipated beam time The anticipated neutron imaging beam time for these experiments is five days NRL will fabricate the Li-ion battery pouch cells form and cycle in advance of neutron imaging measurements to trigger and confirm the presence of Li plating The 15 m detector will be used for 15 days and the 20 m detector will be used for 3 days with 05 days to switch between the two detectors References 1 D Howell S Boyd B Cunningham S Gillard L Slezak S Ahmed I Bloom A Burnham K Hardy A N Jansen P A Nelson D C Robertson T Stephens R Vijayagopal R B Carlson
