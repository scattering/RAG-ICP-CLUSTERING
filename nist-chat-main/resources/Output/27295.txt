Proximity Effect in Superconducting Sr2RuO4 and Ferromagnetic SrRuO3 Heterostructures Background Sr2RuO4 is an unconventional superconductor with a Tc of 15 K While the Tc is fairly low this particular superconductor is of interest due to the potential pairing symmetry of the Cooper pairs In previous experiments time-reversal symmetry breaking has been thought to occur in the superconducting state as shown by NMR giving evidence for the possibility of spin-triplet pairing S  1 In addition it was initially thought that perhaps the angular momentum pairing wave function could be of chiral p-wave symmetry px  ipy The realization of chiral p-wave order is significant both technologically and scientifically because it is believed that this ordering should be topologically non-trivial and exhibit gapless surface modes representing the realization of the so-called Majorana fermions and also Majorana zero modes in the superconducting vortices The technological potential is realized when considering the non-Abelian braiding statistics of these Majorana zero modes for topological quantum computation Despite these motivations the pairing symmetry of Sr2RuO4 is still unknown and recent experiments have challenged the spin-triplet picture For example the recent NMR experiments by Pustogow et al rule out the possibility of the spin-triplet picture and therefore chiral p-wave order as they show a substantial drop in the NMR Knights shift in the superconducting state The proximity of the superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 to the ferromagnetic state in SrRuO3 and Ca2-xSrxRuO4 is interesting in this context and has motivated the study of whether ferromagnetic spin fluctuations lead to the unconventional pairing symmetry In a recent polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiment a significant but not dominant scattering was attributed to quasiferromagnetic fluctuations in Sr2RuO4 while the dominant scattering was from the incommensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations In addition to this neutron work Ortmann et al showed that with just 15 Co-doping one can induce a ferromagnetic cluster glass phase in Sr2RuO4 lending further credence to the idea that Sr2RuO4 exhibits competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations which could play an important role in the stabilization of its unconventional pairing symmetry In the proposed experiment we aim to understand Sr2RuO4 in the proximity of a ferromagnet SrRuO3 Recently our group has been able to grow superconducting Sr2RuO4 thin films by oxide molecular-beam epitaxy MBE which exhibit the highest Tc in thin films to our knowledge and represent the only known superconducting Sr2RuO4 thin films grown in the United States In fact the Tc which is 18 K midpoint of the resistive transition is slightly higher than the Tc of bulk single crystals 15 K see Figure 1 for comparison We have established the ability to achieve this high film quality robustly and repeatedly in a variety of strain states in a variety of heterostructures In particular we can now explore heterostructures of Sr2RuO4 214 and SrRuO3 113 where the interplay of ferromagnetic ordering in the 113 subunit with the superconducting paring in the 214 raises Fig 1 Resistivity versus temperature plot at low temperatures showing the comparison between the superconducting transition of our groups best

the interface between these electronic ground states As a demonstration of our film quality we show scanning transmission electron microscopy STEM X-ray reflectivity XRR and electrical transport characterization of the interfacial structure thicknesses of the layers and the superconducting transition of one particular 214113214 heterostructure grown on a 100-oriented LSAT substrate see Figure 2 In this heterostructure the ferromagnetic layer is sandwiched between the two superconducting 214 layers as shown in the schematic drawing in the inset of Fig 2a It is clear that the interface is quite sharp from the XRR Figure 2a and the STEM Figure 2c and from the transport we can see that the structure is indeed superconducting Figure 2b Given the abrupt interface with the measured coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism probing the thickness dependence of the ordering is critical for determining the nature of the interfaces For 214 grown on 001-oriented SrTiO3 we maintain the same excellent film quality with a Tc of 156 K For this strain state we observe that the ferromagnetic order of the 113 exhibits an in-plane component as measured by anisotropic magnetoresistance AMR See Figure 3 The AMR data is shown as a function of theta the angle between the applied field direction and the surface normal of the film This illustrates that the magnetic easy axis is canted from the out-of-plane direction by 30 degrees This in-plane component allows us to use polarized neutron reflectometry to probe the spatial make-up of the magnetic ordering We propose to utilize polarized neutron reflectometry PNR measurements on the NCNR Polarized Beam Reflectometer PBR to evaluate the depth profile of the ferromagnetism in both a 113214 bilayer and 214113214 heterostructures grown on 001-oriented SrTiO3 with varying 113 thickness These samples will be characterized or have already been characterized by a combination of XRR STEM and electrical transport prior to the PNR experiment in the same way shown for the heterostructure in Figure 2 Specifically we ask for beam time to measure one heterostructure of 10 nm 113 20 nm 214 and one trilayer of 10 nm 21410 nm 113 10 nm 214 for a total of 2 films Each of these films are 1 cm x 1 cm in lateral dimensions From our reflectometry simulations of these heterostructures we expect to need to probe a Q range up to 07 nm-1 which will require 1-2 days per temperature and applied magnetic field per film Initial simulations using known magnetization values for thin films of 113 film interfacial

interface between each of the individual layers STEM from Prof Kourkoutis group at Cornell show a large calculated spin asymmetry which is highly sensitive to perturbations of magnetic thickness We will measure these samples using the He3 insert in the 7-T magnet available at NCNR allowing us to achieve temperatures well below both the magnetic ordering and the superconducting ordering at this strain state as has recently been demonstrated for other superconducting systems on PBR In order to demonstrate the effect of the superconductivity we will measure at 4 K well above the ordering temperature and at 300 mK well below the fully ordered superconducting state at 01 T for each sample We will apply a 05 T in-plane field to orient the moment in the magnetic layer which is well below the critical field for the 214 Despite the superconductivity in the 214 we do not expect a strong magnetic shielding effect due to the long magnetic penetration depth much larger than the thickness of these films  It takes 12 hours to change samples in this sample environment for a total of 8 days of requested beam time 1 day for sample changing and 7 days for measurements to achieve appropriate
