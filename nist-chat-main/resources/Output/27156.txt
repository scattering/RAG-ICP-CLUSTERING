Title Biomineralogy of Stainless Steel Accumulated Corrosion Products in Chloride-Containing Waters PI Dr Treva T Brown Naval Research Laboratory Code 7332 Co-PI Dr Jason S Lee Naval Research Laboratory Code 7332 Co-PI Prof Les Butler Louisiana State University Objective Provide fundamental understanding of the relationship between metal-oxidizing bacteria accumulated corrosion products and pittingcrevice corrosion in stainless steels MotivationBackground The austenitic 300 series stainless steel SS designation contains many different compositions of SS 303 304 304L 305 316 316L 321 347 etc but the common factors among them are 18 wt Cr and 8 wt Ni 18-8 and they are non-magnetic 300 series SS is routinely used in US Navy systems eg fuel transfer lines Alloys 316L and Nitronic 50 were candidate alloys for the double-hull Zumwalt-class destroyers DDX designed as multi-mission stealth ships However localized corrosion pitting and crevice corrosion on 300 series SS especially at welds has caused catastrophic failures of these materials Figure 1 Localized corrosion in these alloys has been investigated extensively and in most cases the failures have been diagnosed as microbiologically influenced corrosion without any demonstration of microorganisms or biomineralogy Localized corrosion is typically associated with tubercles or mounds of accumulated corrosion products attributed to the activities of metal-oxidizing bacteria MOB Tubercles on the surface of these alloys in oxygenated chloride-containing waters causes under-deposit corrosion that initiates a series of events leading to aggressive corrosion ie fixation of a small anode surrounded by a large cathode dissolution of metal at the anode acidity under the tubercle and ingress of chloride However the structure mineralogy and microbiology for tubercles on 300 series SS have never been examined in detail Recent work at the Naval Research Laboratory has clarified some long-held erroneous assumptions regarding MOB accumulated corrosion products and corrosion of carbon steels in seawater and fresh water environments Approach It is our hypothesis that MOB are not responsible for the formation structure mineralogy and resulting electrochemistry of accumulated corrosion products on austenitic 300 series SS Alloys in the proposed studies will include 18-8 SS with low carbon content 304L and with Mo addition 316L Field and laboratory experiments with SS alloys of varying chemistries will be designed to answer the following fundamental questions 1 How do the properties of accumulated corrosion products associated with MOB differ from those produced in the absence of MOB 2 Does mineralogy of corrosion products on SS vary with alloy andor environment Figure 1 Through-wall penetration of 31 mm thick welded 316L coupon exposed to flowing seawater for 10 weeks Neutron and X-ray Imaging The region of interest is the metal-biofilm structure at the interface of the 58 diameter crevice former Teflon or ceramic 116 thick stainless steel plate and 14 diameter titanium bolt The expected biofilm structures are delicate hence disassembly of the was crevice former from the plate will destroy the biofilm structure The combination of neutron and X-ray imaging is ideal for this metalmetal oxysulfidebiomass structure The structural elements of interest will have 3D structure Normal to the metal surface the depth of corrosion will be shown by both neutron attenuation the biomass growth boundary and X-ray attenuation the boundary between high density metal and lower density metal corrosion products In the surface plane the structure may show heterogeneities associated with nutrient inflow and waste product outflow at the crevice former The samples will be imaged in a dehydrated condition reached by lyophilisation well before imaging The steel plates are completely covered with biofilm the dried biomass will serve as an internal standardization for the neutronX-ray imaging of biomass between the steel plate and washer A portion of the biofilm near the crevice former will be measured in advanced of imaging to gather mgcm2 data A portion of the dried biofilm will be protected from delamination during transport and handling with aluminum tape A diamond saw will be used to trim the steel plate and titanium bolt The steel plate will be trimmed from 2 in length to just over 1 to allow two-sample stacking at the tomography stage The steel plate will also be trimmed to narrow the plate width around the bolt from 1 to near 58 to enable better X-ray data for this high aspect ratio sample The titanium bolt will be trimmed near the nut to enable better neutron and X-ray data Lastly an aluminum frame will be fabricated to enable simultaneous tomography of two 2 samples At 15-micron pixel size the field-of-view is 125x15 Two trimmed samples will fit into the field-of-view The trimmed samples will have longest path lengths of titanium 1 cm steel 1 cm and biomass  1 cm The neutron and X-ray view normal to the steel plate should yield excellent data and reveal growth structures of the biomass in the crevice former Both the neutron and steel views in the plane of the steel plate will be challenging due to biomass attenuation neutrons and steel attenuation X-ray Nevertheless the neutron view in the plane should show the penetration of the biomass into the steel plate one of the imaging objectives The neutron and X-ray imaging tomography are expected to be 18 hour runs based on Chiang et al work on organic mattershale imaging Chiang 201 Four tomography days are requested with 2 samples mounted in an aluminum frame Hence 8 data sets showing the steelcrevice formerbiomass structure are anticipated Data Processing Data processing strategies for combined neutronX-ray data sets are evolving The organic mattershale study used a qualitative analysis based on visible structures A recent neutronX-ray study of cultured pearls also used a structural analysis Micieli 201 More relevant for this work a study of corroded metal structures used a bivariate histogram analysis to guide the interpretation of the X-ray and neutron attenuation values Jacot-Guillarmod 201 The PI has experience with ImageJFiji software which is quite capable of bivariate histogram analyses with the Color 2 plugin As needed the Naval Research Laboratory team members also have access to Avizo via sponsored guest LSU accounts The NIST neutron imaging facility also has software for bivariate histogram segmentation Albahri et al acquired and processed X-ray tomography data of extensive corroded carbon steel Albahri 201 The samples were taken from shipwrecks after 73 years exposure This work suggest an end point for the steel corrosion with mineral phases such as goethite magnetite and other mineral phases detected along with active microorganisms References Albahri 201 Albahri M et al Xray microcomputed tomography
