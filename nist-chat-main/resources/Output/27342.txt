Starch is the primary energy reserve for higher plants In general it is consisted of two types of macromolecules namely amylose which is essentially a type of linear-chain polymer and amylopectin which is highly branched Starch can crystallize Though researchers often draw analogy between starch crystallization and high polymer crystallization the former is more complex due to various factors such as existence of rich H-bonding both between starch molecules and between starch and its solvent surroundings molecular weight degree of branching and so on Thus multiple processes such as liquid-liquid phase separation gelation and crystallization might coexist The interplay of these complex processes is not fully understood1 Yet understanding starch crystallization is of pivotal importance in producing foods with desirable texture and nutritional properties For example it has been found that crystallinity and crystal morphology in starch has significant influence in enzyme digestibility of starch These results provide a mechanism to manipulate the digestibility of starch products which can lead to important applications The so-called slow-digestible starch SDS and resistant starch RS are used to slow down the postprandial rise in blood glucose level hence is important in treatment of obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease It can also provide long-term energy support for eg athletes and field researchers We propose to use small-angle neutron scattering SANS to investigate the crystallization of starch from different sources from their aqueous melted state The goal is to monitor in situ the change of chain conformation and development of secondary structures during the crystallization process SANS experiment methodology and feasibility Starch from different sources characterized by different molecular weight and degree of branching as discussed in the next section will be suspended in D2O to provide enough contrast The aqueous suspensions become homogenous after heating to approximately 180   then the sample will be temperature jumped to the crystallization temperature and SANS data will be recorded in situ during the crystallization process Unlike high polymers starch crystallization often has a gelation step in which the viscosity of the liquid sample becomes high The problem of precipitation which is often observed for synthetic high polymers in solutions are greatly mitigated This allow us to collect scattering data in a continuous fashion in regular sealed titanium cells Figure 1 shows a preliminary data of a potato starch with 50 hydration collected at the VSANS beamline at the NCNR NIST with the help of local contact The simple experiment clearly demonstrates that the contrast between D2O and the native starch is sufficient to produce analyzable data In Fig 1a a major peak at q 007 1 is observed which is due to lamellar structure of starch crystals At the high-5 rigime at q 04 1 another peak due to the first Bragg peak of B-type starch crystal can also be observed Being able to capture this Bragg peak is advantageous It is the strongest peak in B-type starch crystal according to our XRD data Thus in this particular case the VSANS machine serves as a poor mans simultaneous small- and wide-angle scattering workhorse Simultaneously capturing the low-5 and intermediate-5 data representing secondary structures along with crystallographic signature at the high-5 regime is very useful in understanding the nature of the secondary structure in the time-resolved experiment a b Figure 1 Preliminary SANS data for potato starch with 50 hydration a data in the full-5 range between 0003 to 06 1 b intermediate to high-5 data showing the interference maximum due to lamellar crystal and the first Bragg peak of B-type polymorph The preliminary data indicates that the SANS method is relevant for our purposes Moreover for time-resolved experiment we need not to concern about sample damage which is often a serious problem in X-ray scattering experiment for biopolymers Instrumental configurations experiment protocols and data analysis SANS data needs to be collected in the 5-range between  0003 to 06 1 In VSANS this can be fulfilled by using two instrumental configurations at the VSANS beamline has been tested No high-resolution detector is needed A 1 neutron guides the front detector at 3 m and the middle detector at 16 m B 9 neutron guides the front detector at 07 m and the middle detector at 45 m VSANS instrument is ideal for the proposed experiment We will set up a 7-poistion heating block and a 9-position coldheating block side by side Since the starch sample needs to be melted at about 180  a 7-position block is needed which can reach a high temperature up to about 300  After melting and after data collection in the amorphous state the sample will be manually transferred to the 9-position coldheating block with the temperature set at the crystallization temperature 25 or 50  And continous data collection will be carried out until crystallization is completed SANS data analysis can be outlined though detailed scheme needs to be determined when actually data are in hand For each type of starch we will prepare three concentrations representing dilute semi-dilute and concentrated solution regimes For dilute solution a good starting point for chain conformation modeling is the Gaussian chain Of course deviation from this classical model would be interesting but non-trivial A radius of gyration as a model-independent parameter can always be subtracted In semi-dilute regime the first trial will be given to Ornstein-Zernike model which yields the mesh-size of overlapped chains As crystallization proceeds two-phase system approach will gradually become relevant but the transition period might need more considerations In the late stage when crystalline structures are largely developed lamellar stacking model can be used to analyzing lamellar thickness and its distribution Samples and beamtime request Four different types of starches waxy maize normal maize waxy wheat and high-amylose maize starches will be measured For each type of starch three concentrations in D2O will be prepared Thus 12 samples will be measured in total The crystallization processes are completed in 5h to 6 h according to our DSC and WAXS data not shown In the proposed SANS experiments sample change time is negligible as the two sample holders 7HP and 9CB will be set up side by side no temperature ramping is needed Thus considering time spent on instrument alignment and measurements for various backgrounds we request 3 days of beamtime at the VSANS beamline Reference  Bai Y Cai L Doutch J Gilbert E P  Shi Y C 2014 Structural changes from
