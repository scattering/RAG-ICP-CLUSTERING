Investigating the In-plane Component of the Magnetic Structure of Fe13NbS2 Background The Fe intercalated NbS2 is a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide TMD material that exhibits various superlattice structures at different Fe concentrations 1 The parent compound NbS2 has hexagonal unit cell and shows superconductivity at TC  6 K 4 Unlike similar TMD superconductors TaS2 TaSe2 TiS2 NbS2 does not show charge density wave ordering 4 The system can become magnetic by interstitially doping with different 3d magnetic ions creating a great potential for spintronic applications 136 The 3d ion occupies some of the octahedral cavities in between adjacent S-Nb-S layers and forms superlattice structures at x  12 and 13  Deviation from these doping levels results in site disorder and for Co01NbS2 and Fe030NbS2 the site disorder leads to spin glass behavior below Neel temperature 91 Figure 1 shows the crystal structure of the 3 by 3 superlattice with 13 doping When intercalated by different 3d ions different magnetic ground states were reported including ferromagnetic order with Mg doping  antiferromagnetic order with Co Ni and Fe doping 1 and the lately discovered helical order with Cr doping  Recently the Fe13NbS2 composition has drawn a lot of interests because it shows an anisotropic in-plane magnetoresistance and a current driven magnetic order switching 1 Susceptibility and Mossbauer measurements in this system indicated antiferromagnetic order with the Fe spins aligned along c-axis at TN  47 K 21 which cannot explain the newly observed anisotropic magnetoresistance under in-plane magnetic field It is suggested that the ordered moment is canted from the c-axis and it is the small in-plane component that gives rise to the magnetoresistance anisotropy Applying current pulse through the sample switches the orientation of the in-plane ordered moment which effectively tunes the resistance in the transverse direction This electrical tunable magnetic switching behavior makes the Fe13NbS2 compound suitable for robust fast respond spintronics Figure 1 Shown above is the crystal structure of the Fe13NbS2 3 by 3 superlattice structure Figure 2 Shown above is the magnetic susceptibility curve on our x13 sample with 02 T field along c-axis Figure 3 Picture of a typical piece of the single crystal samples The tick mark on the ruler is 1 mm Experiment The reported magnetic structure of Fe13NbS2 was deducted from powder neutron diffraction susceptibility and Mossbauer measurements and was not fully resolved Since the recent magnetoresistance results suggested a more complex magnetic structure it is worth digging into the static and dynamic magnetic order of the system through elastic and inelastic neutron scattering Single crystal Fe13NbS2 samples were synthesized using chemical vapor transport method The typical size of the crystal is 2 by 1 by 05 mm3 The susceptibility measurement on our sample shows a clear AFM transition at TN  46 K without spin glass behavior in good agreement with the reported Neel temperature for the x  13 superlattice compound as shown in Figure 2 The experiment will be performed using co-aligned Fe13NbS2 single crystals total mass of  1g The sample will be aligned in H0L scattering plane to allow access to strong superlattice peaks 100 and 101 as well as strong magnetic peaks 12 0 0 and 12 0 1 Elastic and inelastic scattering near these peaks will be measured first with zero magnetic field above and below TN Since the sample consists of many single crystal pieces that only have their nuclear structure co-aligned the in-plane magnetic moment of each single crystal piece should be randomly oriented Then a magnetic field of 1 T will be applied in the ab plane at the base temperature to force a co-alignment of the in-plane magnetic moment After removing the field the Bragg pattern as well as the spin wave spectrum up to 10 meV of the HK0 plane will be measured again A qualitative difference in the H0L patterns and the acoustic spin wave spectrum before and after applying magnetic field is expected if the magnetic structure of Fe13NbS2 indeed has in-plane component We therefore propose the following experiment 1 elastic scans near Bragg positions 100 101 12 0 0 and 12 0 1 at 5 20 40 60 100 K before and after applying in-plane magnetic field of 1T 2 inelastic scans near the Bragg positions that show qualitative difference after field at base temperature Based on this plan we would like to request a beamtime of 7 days Preliminary Work As mentioned before the reported magnetic structure of Fe13NbS2 was deducted from powder neutron diffraction susceptibility and Mossbauer measurements No single crystal elastic or inelastic neutron scattering results have been reported on this system For the similar compound Cr13NbS2 that shows helimagnetic order inelastic neutron scattering demonstrated spin wave excitation up to 25 meV 1 Choice of instrument We choose MACS for its high momentum and energy resolutions as well as its high flux and high survey efficiency compared to normal TAS which are all very crucial for studying the static and dynamic spin
