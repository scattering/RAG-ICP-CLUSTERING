 Page 1 of 3 Probing Lateral Lipid Diffusion in Selectively-Deuterated DMPCDSPC Membranes Background Cell membranes provide cell compartmentalization and protection while harboring vital peripheral and integral proteins These membranes are primarily formed of lipid bilayers of various lipid species which are delicately balanced to regulate vital cellular processes such as signaling biomaterial transport cell adhesion and cell division1 Until recently this complex functionality of membranes was attributed to membrane proteins and lipid bilayers were merely treated as a support matrix for proteins However recent studies have established the role of lipid bilayer composition structure and dynamics in determining membrane protein functions2 3 For instance lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions induce lateral membrane heterogeneity in the form of lipid rafts that dictate various membrane functions2 Protein-membrane interactions at the longer timescale micro-seconds to milli-seconds are easier to investigate and these slow dynamics have been linked to various biological functions However it is increasingly recognizable that these slow dynamics have their origins in faster molecular motions through solvent interactions4 or dynamical hierarchy where faster dynamic modes dictate the slower ones5 Faster dynamics in lipid bilayers are difficult to probe experimentally but with the advent of neutron spectroscopy techniques in combination with isotopic labelling of bilayer lipid components faster dynamic time and length scale regimes have been successfully accessed in numerous recent studies6-9 Given the complexity of the lipidome of biological cell membranes and the novelty of the techniques any meaningful investigation of fast membrane dynamics should be conducted on model singlemulti-component systems which while simple can represent select physical phenomena in biological membranes One such example is binary DMPCDSPC membranes which exhibit a rich phase behavior10 11 due to chain length mismatch and represent an ideal system to study dynamics of phase separated lipid domains see Figure 1 At any given DSPC mole fraction the bilayer exists in a mixed fluid phase above the upper transition temperature Tu upper arm in Fig 1A and transitions into a gel-fluid coexistence phase as the temperature is lowered below Tu - where DSPC molecules start to form transient gel nanoclusters and subsequently large thermodynamically-stable gel-domains11 As the temperature further decreases towards the lower transition temperature Tl lower arm in Fig 1A the system transitions into a fully phase-separated gel membrane The domains are rich in the minority component DSPC whereas the matrix is rich in the majority component DMPC The amount of DMPC in DSPC rich domains and DSPC in DMPC-rich matrix can be easily obtained by using the lever rule as shown in Figure 1A Using NSE spectroscopy we have previously9 demonstrated the effects of phase separated DSPC-rich gel domains on the collective dynamics of fluid DMPC-rich matrix Figure 2 discussed in the next section In this study we propose to utilize high-flux backscattering spectrometer HFBS and disk chopper spectrometer DCS at NCNR to explore how lateral diffusion of individual lipid components are affected by the presence of laterally phase separated lipid domains Small Angle Neutron Scattering SANS will be used to probe the structural properties of these membranes Lateral diffusive properties of lipids obtained through this study will complement our earlier results using the framework12 recently developed by Nagao et al which extracts membrane bending rigidity and viscosity through NSE measurements of collective dynamics Figure 1 A Phase diagram of DMPCDSPC membranes obtained by DSC adapted from ref 10 B Coarse-grained MD simulation of a binary lipid vesicle with relative bending rigidity mismatch of 17 our results manuscript in preparation Page 2 of 3 Previous Experiments In previous neutron spin-echo NSE and SANS experiments 23603 and 25336 - manuscript in preparation we used a selection of protiated tail-deuterated and perdeuterated DMPC and DSPC lipids to selectively probe membrane structure bending and thickness fluctuations in DMPC-rich matrix of 7030 DMPCDSPC molmol binary membrane at various temperatures spanning fluid to the gel-fluid coexistence phase of the mixture Differential Scanning calorimetry DSC measurements on these two systems DMPC DSPC-d83 for selectively measuring bending fluctuations of DMPC-rich matrix and DMPC-d54 DSPC-d83 for selectively measuring thickness fluctuations of DMPC-rich matrix show that the upper and lower transition temperatures occur at 359 C 253 C and 376 C 208 C respectively In comparison the transitions occur at 401 C 26 C see Figure 1A for fully protiated membranes Differences in the transition temperatures are caused by different deuteration levels of DMPC and DSPC used in respective samples Our studies showed that the bending rigidity modulus  of DMPC-rich matrix gradually increased as the temperature was lowered towards Tu suggesting the formation of transient DSPC nanoclusters and it increased further in the phase coexistence region with the growth of large DSPC gel-domains Figure 2A On the other hand pronounced thickness fluctuation dynamics were observed at 50 oC and 40 oC completely fluid but got drastically suppressed at 30C gel-fluid coexistence region Figure 2B According to recent experimental12 and theoretical13 developments in NSE data analysis the dampening of thickness fluctuations observed in the DMPC-rich fluid phase indicates an increase in the matrix viscosity Figure 2C Combined with matrix rigidification this could result from a small transient DSPC gel-nanoclusters11 present in the DMPC-rich fluid matrix eg 13 mol at 30 oC see Lever rule Figure 1A or b mechanical coupling between the DMPC-rich fluid matrix and large DSPC-rich gel domains While the NSE-based approach allows indirect extraction of viscous membrane parameters from slower thickness fluctuation analysis it cannot directly resolve faster lateral lipid diffusion sub nano-second which are necessary to discern the two mechanisms discussed above14 15 Choice of Instruments and Aim of Proposed Experiment A combination of DCS and HFBS spectrometer at NCNR can easily access the nano-second to pico-second dynamics needed to fully understand the lateral motion of individual lipids in these domain-forming bilayers This proposal aims at directly measuring the changes in the lipid lateral diffusion in the DMPC-rich matrix in response to a formation of DSPC gel-nanoclusters and b subsequent formation and growth of large DSPC-rich gel-domains from fluid to coexistence phase Decrease in matrix diffusive dynamics from current proposal coupled with dampened collective dynamics bending and thickness Figure 2 A Temperature dependence of the

will provide direct experimental evidence of hierarchical relations between fast individual lipid dynamics and slower collective membrane dynamics Structural characterization of membranes will be performed by SANS under this proposal Proposed Experiments The list of samples proposed in Table 1 will allow structural measurements to compliment the data from HFBS and DCS experiments Lipid vesicles will be prepared at 5 ww in D2O by freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion through 100 nm pore-size polycarbonate membrane using established protocols Samples will be loaded in demountable titanium cells with 1mm path length SANS will probe the entire q-range available including LENS configuration using all 3 sample to detector distances SANS data will be reduced in IgorPro and analyzed using a core-multishell sphere model in SasView Thus for complimentary structural characterization we are separately requesting 1 day of SANS NGB 30m SANS with LENS configuration beamtime References 1
