The anisotropy present in magnetic materials is essential to their use in applications such as in permanent magnets and has recently been a focal point of fundamental importance - for example with Kitaevs prediction of quantum spin liquid behavior for systems with anisotropic interactions on a honeycomb lattice In spin-glass systems anisotropy is usually single-ion-like thus for high-spin d5 systems in which each d-orbital is singly occupied such as in Fe3 containing spin-glasses there is expected to be weak gg10 g-factor anisotropy and weak D005 meV single-ion anisotropy It came as a surprise therefore when Fe2TiO5 was found to exhibit highly anisotropic responses below and above its spin-glass freezing temperature Tf55 K  This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic pseudo-brookite structure with random mixing among Fe3 and Ti4 ions similar to that of an inverse spinel see Fig 1 Most strikingly the sharp cusp in the linear c-axis susceptibility c1 seen at Tf is not reflected in a1 and b1 see Fig 1 Two distinct puzzles are embedded in these results the anisotropy of the susceptibility above Tf for a system containing Fe3 and the absence of freezing anomalies in a1 and b1 at Tf These puzzles motivate our interest in this compound Previously we carried out extensive neutron diffraction experiments discussed further below which led us to propose a microscopic model by which these puzzles could be understood Specifically the neutron data indicate that surfboard-shaped antiferromagnetically correlated regions develop upon cooling towards Tf see Fig 2 with the spatially longest direction along a in accordance with the orientation of corrugated double chains in the crystal structure We argue that these surfboards form nano-scale antiferromagnets with the spins aligned either parallel or antiparallel to a They mimic the behavior of an XY spin where the easy plane is transverse to the longitudinal axis a In our model the resulting XY quasi-spin interacts only with other quasi-spins along c and the spin-glass freezing has an Ising-like response in the susceptibility since the quasi-spins themselves can only fluctuate along c Thus we seem to have an unusual situation in which interactions among isotropic atomic spins give rise to a highly anisotropic degree of freedom which itself is formed by interactions In other words the Ising anisotropy in Fe2TiO5 is an emergent property driven by interactions among atomic spins Fig 1 Inverse susceptibility of Fe2TiO5 for H perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis Inset structure of Fe2TiO5 showing the FeTi sites blue balls and oxygen red balls Fig 2 Schematic of AFM surfboards and T-dependence of the correlation lengths along a and c We believe that the explanation for the emergent anisotropy in Fe2TiO5 is a new result within the field of spin-glass systems and that this system merits additional investigations The goal of the present proposal is to make use of high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to investigate the temporal nature of the spin correlations that are present resolving between fluctuating and static spins on  picosecond timescales We have performed extensive preliminary experimental investigations of the magnetic susceptibility and the diffuse neutron scattering of Fe2TiO5 crystals These results are currently submitted and under review see arXiv190511534 As shown in Fig 3 we observed strong diffuse magnetic scattering and developed a model for the ordering of spins that give rise to the diffuse scattering as discussed above Using Corelli we were able to turn cross-correlation on and off which essentially yields the energy-resolved elastic cross-section on  meV scales and the energy-integrated cross-section We observed that the energy-integrated cross-section was much stronger than the elastic cross-section at high temperature reflecting the presence of fluctuating spin correlations and an elastic signal only present because of the quasielastic nature of the fluctuations Upon cooling the elastic cross-section increases faster than the energy-integrated however the elastic remains weaker than the energy-integrated cross-section down to 5 K indicating that spin fluctuations are still present at base temperature The temperature dependence of the elastic and energy-integrated cross-sections on Corelli yields a broad idea of what is going on in the spin dynamics but to truly understand the fluctuating nature of the spins we need to be able to measure the energy dependence of the diffuse cross-section in inelastic measurements DCS has the energy resolution momentum transfer range and momentum transfer resolution to investigate the quasi-elastic fluctuations on the time-scales anticipated for a spin-glass system We will measure the quasi-elastic cross-section of the diffuse scattering from our Fe2TiO5 crystals as a function of temperature from  5 K to 300 K The crystals are faceted and already aligned We will measure SQ by rotating the sample 360 We possess crystals varying between 100 mg and 200 mg These crystals are faceted and we would co-align the crystals to a total mass of  1 g before the experiment The local magnetic moments correspond to S52 We ask for 5 days to carry out such measurements References  U Atzmony et al Phys Rev Lett 43 783 1979 Fig 3 Measured magnetic
