 Page 1 of 3 Zwitterionic Hydrogel Structure and Interactions with Proteins Amir Erfani Javen Weston Katie Weigandt Josh Ramsey and Clint P Aichele Background and Scientific Importance Advancement of therapeutic protein therapies enzyme-based biosensors and many enzyme based chemical processes have been hindered by the poor stability and short half-life of proteins Protein stability depends on interactions between solvents and proteins interactions between excipients and proteins and proteins interacting with other proteins in a given solution  There is emerging evidence that biocompatible zwitterionic polymersmoieties polymers with equal numbers of opposite charges on each monomer can prevent non-specific interactions within proteins system 2  For instance recently our work has shown how these interactions can be tuned to prevent protein aggregation  While emerging evidence indicates that the zwitterionized polymers have biocompatibility properties that can have applications in protein stability and protein delivery there is little empirical information available on their mechanism of action Currently we are synthesizing two different chemistries of zwitterionic hydrogels crosslinked polymers with high water content beads We are able to load model proteinsenzymes inside these hydrogels for slow release as well as immobilization of proteinsenzymes for heterogenous enzymatic reactions and biosensors SANS has been used to evaluate structure of polymeric hydrogels and the hydration structure and dynamics of a variety of proteins However to our knowledge structure of these zwitterionic hydrogels have not been studied using the technique SANS offers the unique ability to use contrast matching to isolate scattering in multi-component systems Prior work has indicated that the scattering length densities of the polymers and proteins of interest to us are sufficiently different for contrast matching experiments to be a realistic option No technique beyond SANS allows for this level of contrast matching without altering the solution chemistry to a much greater degree Preliminary Work Currently we are studying two types of zwitterionic hydrogels synthesized by chemical crosslinking of zwitterionic polymers synthesized in our lab These hydrogels are based on zwitterionic polymer poly-sulfobetaine PSB 5- and poly-carboxy betaine PCB 2  We have carried out different bio-physical characterization studies on the effects of these zwitterionic hydrogels on protein hydration and stability We have also carried out 1H NMR and diffusion NMR experiments to characterize these polymers Fig 1 illustrates some of the experimental characterizations and Fig 2 shows some preliminary SANS measurements measured at the NIST Center for Neutron Researchs NGB-10m SANS instrument for the protein and polymer in which the hydrogel is made of Fig1 Left schematic of the poly-zwitterion Middle SEM of PSB zwitterionic hydrogel crosslinked polymer beads Right hydrogels loaded with fluorescently labelled albumin Page 2 of 3 Fig2 Scattering intensity curves for buffered BSA in H2O left and of a buffered PSB solution in D2O right A model fit indicates that the PSB studied here has a radius of gyration of 14 nm and porod exponent of -18 which indicates that PSBMA is very well-solubilized in the buffer solution and very flexible The BSA scattering shows an unacceptable level of noise at low-q which will be addressed by reducing the incoherent background and increasing the measurement time in future experiments probing the same q range Experimental Plan The structures and interactions our experiments intend to probe are perfectly within the range of those probed by the SANS instrument 1-100 nm Also the contrast matching technique will give us the ability to study the structure and dynamics of the protein and the hydrogel network separately We plan to contrast match the protein and the hydrogel synthesis separately This will allow us to explore the structure and dynamics of the hydrogel in the presence of the biomacromolecule Our investigation consists of two parts that are summarized in Tables I-II Part 1 consists of contrast matching runs for the materials zwitterionic hydrogels Our hypothesis is that the superhydrophilic zwitterionic hydrogel can prevent protein adsorption thereby leading to the retention of the tertiary structure of the protein We also expect to see some level of zwitterionic polymer self-association in these hydrogels Table I Contrast matching runs Sample Number of variable levels crosslinking density Number of tests Zwitterionic hydrogel buffered 3 9 In the second part summarized in Table II not only the structure of these hydrogels will be studied but protein dynamicsstructure in the hydrogel will also be studied We will evaluate if different crosslinking ratios affect the protein confined inside the hydrogel We will also study the structure of zwitterionic hydrogel beads with immobilized proteins We propose running 21 tests at 2 hours per test so we request 2 days of beam time Table II Protein in zwitterionic hydrogel experiments Sample

Outcomes The protein hydration and length of the hydration layer amount of bound water will be deduced using the methods described by Bendedouch and Svergun 9 1 Scattering will also be interpreted using the SasView program along with appropriate models for proteins dissolved polymers and hydrogels The results of this study will help the PhD student involved in this project to complete his researchthesis on the interactions of zwitterionic moieties with proteins Results will be published in top peer-reviewed journals such as Langmuir Biomacromolecules and ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering The results of this study will help provide fundamental insights into the mechanism by which zwitterionic moieties can help increase protein stability prevent non-specific binding and decrease immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins This better understanding can later translate to designing functional protein-polymer complexes for protein delivery and protein formulations that can address deterrents in advancements of biopharmaceuticals Page 3 of 3 References 1 Kamerzell TJ et al Protein-excipient interactions Mechanisms and biophysical characterization applied to protein
