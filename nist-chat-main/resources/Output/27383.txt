Study Dilution-induced Complex Coacervation using Small Angle Neutron Scattering Introduction Complex coacervation is a form of liquid-liquid phase separation LLPS resulting from strong associative interactions among oppositely charged macromolecules Since the major driving force for complex coacervation is electrostatic interactions the LLPS can be induced by changes in ionic strength pH as well as the stoichiometry between the two oppositely charged macromolecules1-3 In general a key requirement for this LLPS appears to be the formation of inter-polymer complexes close to charge neutrality In marked contrast is the observed formation of coacervates upon iso-ionic dilution ie dilution-induced complex coacervation DIC The reverse process the disappearance of coacervates at high macromolecular concentration CT has been commonly referred to as self-suppression4 Complex coacervation has been used for delivering actives such as moisturizing and conditioning agents in personal care formulations micelle-polyelectrolyte complexes are stabilized in a one phase region at high CT and then phase separate as coacervate liquid droplets upon dilution during rinsing5 Such formulation offers the potential of controlled deposition of active solubilizates via DIC on eg hair and textiles5 This use of dilution-induced complex coacervation for delivery inspired us to study the effects of CT on the coacervation process in order to discern a common mechanism so that such phenomena can be used in other potential applications While self-suppression may refer to the reduction of coacervate yield at high CT the typical relevant experiments essentially proceed in the opposite direction namely the appearance of turbidity upon iso-ionic dilution Since continuous increase in CT is rarely attempted it is not clear whether dilution-induced coacervation is mechanistically simply the reverse of self-suppression Previously we investigated the dilution-induced complex coacervation of a two component system consisting a polycation polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride PDADMAC and a protein bovine serum albumin BSA4 The phase boundary of BSA-PDADMAC system in the studied buffer environment is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 - Phase boundary of BSA-PDADMAC system in 01 M NaCl solution pH  73 at room temperature Vertical arrow indicates dilution corresponding to rapid decrease in size of BSAPDADMAC complexes as shown in Figure 2 In order to examine various species that occur during the course of DIC dynamic light scattering DLS experiments were performed DLS results for BSA-PDADMAC system is shown in Figure 2 DLS results suggest that upon iso-ionic dilution the inter-polymer complexes with radii greater than 200 nm disappear somewhere in the range 200  CBSA  130 g L1 while the size of intra-polymer complexes decreases from 50 to 35 nm with further dilution Here we observe a decrease in particle size upon iso-ionic dilution prior to complex coacervation which takes place at CBSA of 60 g L1 Such results strongly suggest that dilution-induced coacervation is a consequence of the formation of intra-polymer complexes4 Figure 3 The increase in the number of complexes upon dilution must be accompanied by a decrease in inter-particle separation thus favoring electrostatic interactions between complexes of unlike charge Attractive interactions among oppositely charged intra-polymer complexes are likely to drive the final stage of phase separation Figure 3 - Proposed mechanism of dilution induced complex coacervation The dilution promotes the formation of small un-evenly charged intra-polymer complexes these complexes then coalescence to form complex coacervates Proposed Small Angle Neutron Scattering Measurements Coacervates are liquid-like material that is sensitive to environmental conditions including pH shear and ionic strength as a result conventional structure characterization techniques cannot be used since they require prior sample preparation In contrast SANS technique will allow direct determination of the size shape composition and special organization of protein-polyelectrolyte complexes over a wide range of length scales Such information will not only provide strong evidence to support our proposed mechanism for DIC but it will also provide theoretical foundations for the development of complex coacervates as delivery systems In this study we will use small angle scattering to study 1 the structural transition of BSA-PDADMAC complexes from self-suppression to coacervation through iso-ionic dilution 2 the microstructure of BSA-PDADMAC complexes in the self-suppressed state after cycling into and out of the biphasic Figure 2 - Relative intensity for BSAPDAMAC at various BSA concentrations in 010 M NaCl pH 73 Broken line indicates relative number of particles with Rh  200 nm The peak at 38 nm corresponds to the radius of BSA phase such structural information will help us to determine whether dilution-induced coacervation is mechanistically simply the reverse of self-suppression We propose to measure BSAPDADMAC complexes weight ratio of PDADMACBSA  0033 prepared in deuterated 01M NaCl buffer with a series of CBSA concentrations 200 175 150 125 100 75 60 50 25 10 and 5 gL BSAPDADMAC stock solutions will be prepared at a BSA concentration of 200 gL iso-ionic dilution using 01M NaCl solution will be performed to prepare the diluted samples For coacervated samples stock solutions will be added to increase the CBSA concentration to above 60 gL where self-suppression takes place Such self-suppressed sample will be measured again by SANS to examine if the structure of BSAPDADMAC complexes is similar to that observed before phase separation Therefore we propose to measure 11 samples during the course of dilution  11 samples during the course of concentration  BSA control  PDADMAC control  buffer background  25 samples in total Due to the presence of hierarchical structures we would like to measure the samples over a wide q-range Therefore 2 configurations on the VSANS instrument will be used probe a wide range of length scales from the conformation of individual BSA and PDADMAC molecules up to the hierarchical organization and the overall structure of BSA-PDADMAC complex assemblies It is assumed that each sample will take 25 hours to measure so it takes 25  25 hours  25 days to measure all of the samples With the time needed to set-up the 6-position rotating sample stage due to phase separation we would like to request 3 days of beamtime on the VSANS instrument Moreover USANS measurements will be performed to further extend the q-range structural information in this size range will complement the SANS results together these results will provide a complete picture of the structural transitionorientation of BSAPDADMAC complexes both inter- and intra-polymer complexes upon dilution induced complex coacervation Consider the contrast between hydrogenated biomacromolecules and the deuterated buffer background each sample takes 8 hours to measure in order to achieve good statistics therefore it takes 9 days to measure all the samples on USANS Together we would like to ask for 3 days of VSANS  9 days of USANS beamtime References 1 Wang Y L Kimura K Huang Q R Dubin P L Jaeger W Effects of salt on polyelectrolyte-micelle coacervation Macromolecules 1999 32 21 7128-7134 2 Obermeyer A C Mills C E Dong X H Flores R J Olsen B D Complex coacervation of supercharged proteins with polyelectrolytes Soft Matter 2016 12 15 3570-3581 3 Kayitmazer A B Seeman D Minsky B B Dubin P L Xu Y S Protein-polyelectrolyte interactions Soft Matter 2013 9 9 2553-2583 4 Xu A Y Kizilay E Madro S P Vadenais J Z McDonald K W Dubin P L Dilution induced coacervation in polyelectrolyte-micelle and polyelectrolyte-protein systems Soft Matter 2018 14 12 2391-2399 5 Miyake M Recent progress of the characterization of oppositely charged polymersurfactant complex in dilution deposition system Adv Colloid Interfac 2017 239 146-157
