Figure 1 Schematic of the structure of the polyiso-butylene-graft- alanine polymer with Z alanine units in the grafts and a tail chain of C19H38 Figure 2 Structural model for nanocrystal in swollen p-PIB-g-A3 showing significant brush volume adjacent to the crystal Strain Softening in Rubber Nanocomposites Reinforced with Nanocrystalline Domains Objective The objective is to test the hypothesis that upon large scale deformation reinforcing nanocrystallites that self-assemble in a novel nanocomposite formed by polyisobutylene chains with short side chains of oligo- alanine  fracture to dissipate energy By this fracture chains close to crystallite surfaces to which they were tethered gain mobility which should be evident in relaxation times of the chains in swollen samples Background Thermoplastic elastomers TPEs attain good mechanical performance by virtue of hard reinforcing domains that result from microphase separation of two immiscible covalently connected parts of the chains  The hard component of the chains self-assembles into discrete domains with the smallest dimension well below 100 nm and the soft component forms a continuous phase The use of monodisperse hard segments with a strong tendency to self-assemble to form well-defined -sheet secondary structures via cooperative multiple hydrogen bonds has received attention as a strategy for forming hard reinforcing domains 2345 more effective than the types previously known The reinforcement in such a supramolecular elastomer containing crystalline domains formed by -sheet stacking mimics the type of reinforcement present in silks 5 However the crystalline domains in silks are smaller than ten nanometers  in all three dimensions It has proved difficult to obtain synthetically domains so small in three dimensions In previous studies of synthetic TPEs the -sheet crystals have been fibrous with the longest dimension ranging from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers and the other two dimensions being a few tens of nanometers 45 We succeeded in synthesizing TPEs p-PIB-g-A3 with hard domains having a longest dimension well below 100 nm  by entropically limiting the degree of association due to favorable hydrogen bonding Polyisobutylene PIB chains are synthesized with graft side chains that have a few z -alanine units in each as shown in Figure 1 Mechanical studies have shown that this nanocrystalline structure is extraordinarily effective in reinforcing elastic networks  The nanocrystalline domains have PIB chains tethered to their surfaces Analysis of SAXS data from dry samples and SANS data from samples swollen with deuterated solvent yields the structure in Figure 2 for a swollen sample of p-PIB-g-A3 When the side chain structure is modified slightly from that in Figure 1 the 80 65 80 2000 14 140 Figure 3 Structural model for nanocrystal in swollen f-PIB-g-A3 showing much longer nano-crystalline domain due to smaller stretching of PIB chains nanocrystalline domains are much longer due to less stretching of the portions of the PIB backbones closest to where the those chains are tethered to the crystalline faces in structures like brushes brushes of loops Differences in the chain microdynamics due to different stretching for the two materials can be seen for swollen samples in NSE measurements made at NIST Figure 4 The captured dynamics are a mixture of those for portions of chains in the swollen matrix and portions of chains close to the nanocrystals which are slowed by tethering For the smallest Q values corresponding to length scales 12 nm and for the largest Q corresponding to about 4 nm  values for p-PIB-g-A3 and f-PIB-g-A3 are similar However for intervening length scales the dynamics are markedly slower for the particulate sample despite the fact that the swelling for p-PIB-g-A3 is 50 greater and therefore p-PIB-g-A3 is more plasticized Preliminary in situ XPCS measurements at Argonne National Lab of dogbone samples not swollen under step strain show that the microdynamics of the nanodomains following strain are also very different for the two materials In the proposed measurements we will address the mechanism for strain induced softening at high strains eg 700 that occurs without spectroscopic evidence of large scale hydrogen bond breakage in the nanodomains We hypothesize the softening is due to a mechanism we call fracture and recoil scheme 2 If crystals fracture with strain the Scheme 2 Fracture and recoil mechanism of strain-induced softening  apparent chain mobility in a swollen strained sample should be higher than that in an unstrained sample since a smaller fraction of all chain segments are in highly stretched portions adjacent to the crystal Since the stress strain behavior recovers very slowly over months we expect it will be possible to see differences in chain mobility in highly strained samples using samples swollen after strain Method Polyisobutylene chains with -alanine grafts Figure 1 have been synthesized by Prof Li Jia and his group  These molecules can self-assemble to form reinforcing nanocrystalline domains The molecules have been thoroughly characterized using GPC FT-IR and DSC Static morphologies of the microphase separated materials have been probed with SAXS WAXS SANS and TEM Their Brush-like chainRecoiled chainFigure 4 NSE results for p-PIB-g-A3 red and f-PIB-g-A3 blue variation of  with Q mechanical properties have been investigated using small-amplitude oscillatory-shear measurements Samples of exactly the right size to fill the 4 cm diameter demountable sample holders with 1 mm path length will be made by compression molding The reinforced rubber sample sized to nearly fill the cell only after swelling will be placed in the cell solvent added and the cell sealed The equilibrium swelling ratio are known We will obtain plots of normalized intermediate scattering function as a function of time for various values of Q The first question to answer is whether the observed chain dynamics speed up after large strain Fitting these functions can provide information about the types of dynamics present and their characteristic relaxation times We expect to see the NSE data reflecting both the dynamics of the chains in the matrix perhaps for Q  01 -1 and the movement of the stretched chains perhaps at Q below the peak around 007 -1 In order to obtain the clearest results in a short study we will focus first on our material that forms the smallest nanodomains that are truly nano in all three dimensions p-PIB-g-A3 That material shows strong SANS intensity Then we will look at the material with larger nanocrystallites f-PIB-g-A3 which shows even stronger scattering near the SANS feature associated with the nanodomains Based on our previous NSE measurements Figure 4 we expect that measurement of one sample will require 15 days We wish to measure two samples at different strains for each type of material p-PIB-g-A3 and f-PIB-g-A3  for a total of 4 samples over 6 days Expected results We expect to see speeding up of the chain dynamics with increasing strain due to recoil of chains at the edges of fractures of the nanocrystalline domains for materials forming both fibrous and particulate nanodomains These measurements are part of the thesis work of Aarushi Srivastava References 1 Holden G et al 1996 HanserGardner Publications Cincinnati 2
