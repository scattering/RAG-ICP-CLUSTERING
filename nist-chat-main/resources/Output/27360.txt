Fayetteville NC 28301-4252 Introduction In past few decades overwhelming use of conventional fuels in automobiles and industries hampered the environment severely due to pollutions In order to mitigate this pollution related issues research communities are looking for the production of fuels in a greener way1-2 Amid these technologies electrochemical water splitting shows potentials which produces oxygen and hydrogen for fuel cells to further make electricity The main challenge in improving energy efficiency of water electrolysis is sluggish kinetics associated with oxygen evolution reaction OER A several number of OER catalysts are assessed to improve the efficiency and among them RuO2 and IrO2 shows promising activity But their high cost and scarcity hindered their uses in industrial scale On the other hand transition metal oxides like Co- Ni- Fe-based oxides have shown excellent energy efficiency3-4 Amid these transition metal oxides particularly octahedrally coordinated Co-based oxide materials such as perovskites and spinel oxides have shown enhanced OER activity which enlightens the rational design of perovskite oxides containing Co with desirable electronic structure for OER Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that OER activity related to the electronic structure of Co ions consisting spin state and oxidation state For instance Shao-Horn et al reported the direct dependence of electrochemical activity of perovskite Ba05Sr05Co08Fe02O3- BSCF on eg configuration of cobalt and BSCF with eg12 shows improved OER activity5 Nevertheless prolonged cycling of Co-based perovskite oxides under OER conditions undergoes surface amorphization6 Hence considerable improvement is still required to fabricate efficient OER catalysts with improved activity and stability In this regard Shao-Horns principle suggests that the rational design of OER catalyst having eg value near to 12 should be the best strategy to develop the perovskite oxides as the efficient OER catalysts7 Recently an experimental optimization of eg value 12 by doping of Co by Nb in tetragonal SrNb01Co07Fe02O3- oxide a038808 nm and c077679 nm results in efficient OER catalyst7 In this work we will prepare a new series of Sr-Co-Fe-O and Ca-Co-Cr-O double perovskites nanomaterials by preparing series of compounds through varying the ratio between CoFe and CoCr Some samples will be doped with nitrogen N on the oxygen O sites The following experiments will be conducted 1 Preparation of Perovskite Nanomaterials The samples of nanoparticles were prepared by chemical reactions The molar ratio of Co and Fe varies according to the ratio of perovskite oxide such as Sr2Co2O5- Sr2Co175Fe025O5- Sr2Co15Fe05O5- Sr2Co125Fe075O5- Sr2Co075Fe125O5- Sr2Co05Fe15O5- Sr2Co025Fe175O5- and Sr2Fe2O5- The prepared gel was carbonized at temperature of 250 C for 5 h and annealed at 1050 C for 12 h yielding black colored powders The XRD patterns of as-synthesized Sr-Co-Fe-O samples displayed in Fig 1 where we can observe that except Sr2Co2O5- sample remaining series of samples showing patterns of a pure cubic phase without any 2 Figure 3 LSVs of

phases However Sr2Co2O5- sample shows a hexagonal structure 2 Magnetic Measurements and Electrochemical Study To reveal electronic spin states of cobalt with the variation cobalt and Fe ratios we conducted temperature-dependent magnetizations measurements under the eld-cooling procedures with a magnetic eld H of 100 Oe The magnetic susceptibility   MH curves of all samples are shown in Fig 2a All samples obey the Curie-Weiss law   CT -Tc at high temperatures where C is Curie constant T is temperature in K and Tc is Curie-Weiss temperature in K The reverse susceptibility curves of all samples shown in Fig 2b From the linear fit of reverse susceptibility curves we can get the C value and from the interpolation of the same linear fit intercepts at X-axis we can get the Tc value Electrochemical measurements of all samples are monitored with the help of linear sweep voltammogram LSV technique as displayed in Fig 3 From the figure we can observe that Sr2Co15Fe05 O5 sample displays superior OER activity among them 3 Neutron Diffraction at CHRNS We propose to conduct the research at CHRNS using BT-1 instrument in the temperature range of 5300 K at 100 Oe using superconducting 7 T vertical field with TLCCR as follows 1 To study the magnetic structures using the unique property of the magnetic dipole moment of neutrons Specifically since neutron scattering is a direct probe of the magnetic order in materials the nature ie antiferromagnetism ferromagnetism or ferromagnetism and characteristics ie temperature and field dependence of the magnetic structure can be obtained from these measurements In this research the magnetic structures of Fe- and Co-containing perovskites will be studied using neutron diffraction and then the results will be correlated with properties 2 To study the light elements in the perovskites In nitrogen-doped perovskite-type oxynitrides ABO3-xNx the N dopant in the perovskite lattice results in distinct changes in the electronic structure Figure 2 Magnetic susceptibility curves a and magnetic reverse susceptibility curves b of Sr-Co-Fe-O samples 3 leading to unusual physical properties8 Recently nitrogen doping was found to significantly increase the Ni3 contents and oxygen vacancies on the bulk surface of the perovskite which promoted the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction of the cathode9 In our samples since the X-ray atomic form factors of O and N are nearly identical these two elements cannot be distinguished by XRD while neutron scattering lengths are considerably different 5803 fm for O and 9360 fm for N to identify these light elements The results by neutron diffraction will provide insights of the perovskite material structures enabling the correlations of the materials structures with their electrochemical and magnetic properties Acknowledgement This research is funded by NSF in collaborating with the Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering CHRNS entitled
