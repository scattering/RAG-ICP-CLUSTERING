 Page 1 of 3 Statement of Research Scientific Importance Frustrated magnetic materials with competing interactions have proven a fertile arena for the discovery of novel emergent phenomena In these systems frustration disturbs the development of conventional long-range order down to very low temperatures leading to many exotic phases of matter such as classical and quantum spin liquids SL Consequently it is expected that in SL candidates competing interactions lead to degenerate states providing a rich platform to investigate novel emergent phenomena such as fractional excitations Significant attention has been focused on understanding geometric frustration in rare-earth compounds In these systems the subtle interplay between frustration due to the geometry of the lattice and the spin-orbit coupling as well as crystal field anisotropy of the rare earth ion can lead to a variety of rich emergent phenomena Most exotic cases of geometrically frustrated quantum magnets can be found in two-dimensional systems such as Kagome and triangular lattices In fact decades ago an original SL state was proposed for a triangular lattice TL Heisenberg antiferromagnet with single magnetic ion per unit cell and though later a magnetically ordered state was suggested as the ground state of such a system the possibility of SL has maintained to be a leading hypothesis in a broader framework For instance a recently reported theoretical phase diagram for TL system proposes to host a new SL phase which is connected to a previously predicted phase  Concurrently many experimental efforts have been focused on designing and synthesizing new materials with a perfect TL and in particular several families of compounds with rare earth TLs have attracted much attention recently 2- Preliminary Work Motivated by the recent proposed theoretical phases as well as reported results collected on rare-earth TL compounds such as YbMgZnGaO4 in single crystal form as well as similar work performed on other compounds in polycrystalline form 2- we have synthesized the rare-earth TL compound Ba3Yb11BO33  BYBO single crystals - where 10B isotope has been substituted with 11B isotope to minimize neutron absorption Importantly BYBO should not exhibit site-mixing to nearly the same extent as previous QSL candidates with respect to either magnetic and non-magnetic ions or between non-magnetic ions owing to the large differences between atomic radii of the ions Figure 1 shows the crystal structure and powder x-ray diffraction confirming the pure phase and the high quality of the sample We show in Figure 2 susceptibility and inverse susceptibility as a function of temperature collected for constant applied field of 001 T parallel to ab-plane measured from single crystal samples we grew using the floating zone method The Curie-Weiss fits to the magnetic susceptibility measurements result in cw  -16448 K for H  ab-plane Figure 2c shows magnetization data collected for constant temperature of 2 K for field applied in the ab-plane Moreover the non-linear magnetization response shows saturation values of 12 BYb Heat capacity shows no indication of ordering as shown in Figure 2d We show in Figure 2e a tunnel diode oscillator measurement for a range of angles of applied magnetic field - this extremely sensitive technique shows the anisotropic magnetic behavior Highlighting the systems large degree of frustration and critical for the possibility of a quantum spin liquid phase Figure 3 shows neutron powder diffraction data collected at the BT1 powder diffractometer at NCNR where 80 mK data and a 20 K background subtraction shows no Figure 1 Left Structure of Ba3YbBO33 Yb ions are blue oxygen is red boron is purple and barium is green Right Powder XRD confirming the BYBO phase Page 2 of 3 indication of Bragg peaks signaling absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to lowest accessible temperature Recently we performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments at SEQUOIA on BYBO powder samples to identify the CEF levels As shown in Figure 4 a-b CEF levels for BYBO was observed at 342 meV and 524 meV Very recently we performed inelastic neutron scattering experiment at MACS on single crystal sample of BYBO Selected plots of the low energy excitations observed at E  025 meV and E  2 meV are shown in Figure 4 cd Low energy excitations are emerging from the high symmetry points as shown in Fig 3c At 2 meV excitations are weak however the similar features can be observed in Fig 3d We just finished collecting this data and need more time to digest and analyze the results however it is clear that to understand the low energy excitations in more detail continuation experiment to perform additional scans at more energy transfers and detailed field dependence of the low energy excitations is needed Choice of Instrument For this experiment we need to access low incident neutron energies at low Q and with sufficiently high resolution to capture in detail the structure of the low lying excitations For this reason MACS would be an ideal instrument for this study Furthermore MACS allows the use of a dilution refrigerator which would be important for studying ground state We would also need a minimum of 5T magnetic field to measure the field-dependence of excitations We plan to co-align Figure 2 a Magnetic susceptibility measured with applied field parallel to sample ab plane Inset -
