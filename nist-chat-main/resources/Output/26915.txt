Anion-dependent organic cation dynamics and broadband photoluminescence in layered perovskites Scientific Importance Generating artificial white light for indoor lighting applications remains a challenge in materials chemistry White light emission is typically achieved through the mixing of phosphors or extrinsic dopants and is not normally efficiently intrinsic1-2 Intrinsic emission in a single material could circumvent current device issues if the process is efficient Intrinsic white light broadband emission has been observed in 001-layered hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites HOIPs3-7 A specific example which is the focus of this proposal is the series of compounds BZA2PbX4 where BZA  benzylammonium Figure 1 and X  Cl Br or I that adopt the layered perovskite structure ie K2NiF4 structure type The solid-solution BZA2PbCl4-xBrx presents the ideal materials system to understand the role of chemical dynamics on exciton self-trapping While BZA2PbBr4 exhibits spectrally narrow excitonic photoluminescence at ambient temperatures compounds containing a mixture of Cl and Br show strong broadband white emission7 The observed broadband emission in this class of layered perovskite materials has been attributed to the formation of self-trapped excitons STEs8 These excitons are thought to be formed through strong electron-phonon coupling induced by inorganic sublattice distortions This has been proposed to result from distortions such as transient halide dimerization as in PbBr29 Recombination from these dynamically stabilized excited states can give rise to broad shifted emissions10 Strong correlations have been drawn between bond angles in the lattice that accompany different organic cations with emission in these layered compounds6 a similar correlation has been drawn with halide substitution7 In general the more distorted the crystal lattice the more intense the broadband emission additionally the more electronegative the anion the more distorted the compound The organic cation dynamics play a significant role in lattice distortion Our previous work on nBA2PbBr4 GABA2PbBr4 and ODAPbBr4 involving QENS and photoluminescence PL spectroscopy shows that the intensity of the broadband emission is inversely correlated with the H dynamics in the material Figure 2 We have also shown how A-site substitution strongly inhibits organic cation dynamics in CH3NH31-xCsxPbBr311 and CHNH221-xCsxPbBr3 in review Others have shown that partial halide substitution inhibits dynamics of the organic cation12 Here we hypothesize that the halogen substitution in BZA2PbCl4-xBrx inhibits the BZA dynamics permitting exciton self-trapping and the observation of broadband PL seen in Figure 3 Figure 1 Crystal structures of BZA2PbX4  where BZA  benzylammonium and X

in the extrapolation but are shown in b Anion-dependent organic cation dynamics and broadband photoluminescence in layered perovskites To test this hypothesis we propose to study the series BZA2PbCl4-xBrx x  0 2 4 using fixed-window elastic neutron on the CHRNS High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer HFBS to measure the atomic mean-squared displacement of the hydrogen atoms to probe the effects of halide substitution on H dynamics and correlate this structure-dynamics relationship to broadband emission in layered perovskites This proposal accompanies proposed and preliminary QENS experiments on the BASIS spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source which has ideal bandwidth and resolution for the temperatures of interest with these compounds HFBS is needed to obtain high-resolution fixed-window elastic scattering which we have previously used to resolve otherwise hidden phase transitions in CHNH22PbBr313 Fixed-window elastic neutron scattering as a function of temperature collected on HFBS will bring insight to the results of T-dependent and time-resolved PL spectroscopy experiments Preliminary Work We have successfully synthesized the compounds BZA2PbCl4-xBrx x  0 2 4 in gram scale quantities We have collected photoluminescence at various temperatures which serves a guide to the temperature dependence of these neutron studies Choice of Instrument and Need for Neutrons We propose to use the HFBS instrument in a fixed-window setting around the elastic scattering to measure the atomic mean-squared displacement of the hydrogen atoms of the organic moiety The high resolution afforded by HFBS allows for accurate approximation of the hydrogen mobilities at all desired temperatures Neutrons are ideal for our samples as we intend to use the hydrogen which has a very large incoherent scattering factor of 802 to easily probe the dynamics of the organic moieties Other light-based techniques that can be used to study these energy scales eg Brillouin Light Scattering are inappropriate for these samples due to the temperature scales energy scales and non-H-selective probe of the dynamics Experiment Plan One gram of BZA2PbCl4 BZA2PbBr4 and BZA2PbCl2Br2 are currently available for this experiment We will fill a 3 cm cylindrical can with a known amount of solid to reduce preferred orientation effects of our microcrystalline platelets We will load the sample cell in a helium glove box and seal it with an indium O-ring The enclosed helium ensures good thermal contact between the powder and the rest of the sample environment We intend to obtain MSD data at different temperatures on HFBS with the following considerations The typical ramp rate during fixed window scans is 08 Kmin therefore one complete temperature cycle will take approximately fourteen hours per sample when coolingheating and equilibration wait times are considered As there are three samples the total amount of time necessary for these experiments will be approximately 42 hours Safety Consideration These samples contain lead a known health and environmental hazard The appropriate Personal Protective Equipment nitrile gloves will be worn upon loading the sample containers These samples also contain chlorine and bromine which strongly activate in the beam Therefore great care must be taken in changing samples and storage of materials after the experiment as is standard practice at the NCNR References 1 Ye S Xiao F Pan Y X Ma Y Y Zhang Q Y Phosphors in phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes Recent advances in materials techniques and
