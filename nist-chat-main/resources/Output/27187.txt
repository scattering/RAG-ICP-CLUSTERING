Probing Mechanical Properties of Lipid Membranes Containing Sterol-Modified Lipids Scientific Background Liposomes lipid vesicles are widely used as model membranes in research and as successful drug carriers in commercial applications1 2 The development of stable and long-circulating liposomes in vivo provides protection of the drug cargo from degradation and premature realease1 and increases the chances of targeted drug delivery such as tumors for cancer treatments3 Liposomes prepared solely from phospholipids 1st generation are generally considered inferior due to their insufficient stability and low half-life under physiological conditions leading to unintended drug release before reaching the target This problem has been traditionally alleviated through the incorporation of small rigid molecules such as cholesterol which enhance the mechanical properties mainly bending rigidity of lipid membranes4 From the perspective of designing efficient liposomal drug carriers incorporating cholesterol in liposome bilayers makes them less leaky and increases liposome stability in vivo In addition cholesterol reduces the activity of proteins and peptides part of the innate immune system on liposome bilayers by preventing their insertion and membrane disruption5 thus prolonging the liposome circulation time However cholesterol-containing liposomes possess drawbacks of their own Cholesterol rapidly exchanges from the liposomes into bio-membranes and lipoproteins leading to subsequent loss of liposomal stability This issue cannot be solved by increasing cholesterol content as cholesterol tends to phase separate and precipitates out as crystals above 50 mol concentrations6 Additionally cholesterol in liposome formulations is vulnerable to oxidation through enzymatic processes in vivo and non-enzymatic processes in vitro7 8 and is often linked to the onset of various diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis9 10 A more sophisticated method to address drawbacks in cholesterol containing liposome formulation is by covalently linking cholesterol to the phospholipid backbone Here we focus on two novel synthetic lipid chimeras hybrids or sterol modified phospholipids SMLs incorporating a single sterol ring SCholPC Figure 1C and double sterol rings DCholPC Figure 1D into the phospholipid backbone Liposomes formed from these SMLs have been shown to be exceptionally stable in presence of serum and deliver encapsulated molecules at a much reduced rate11 12 In addition to being resistant to oxidation covalently linking cholesterol to the phospholipid backbone reduces sterol flip-flop and exchange ratios between bilayers 100  lower compared to free cholesterol11 However as in traditional liposomes the biological function of SML-liposomes is primarily dictated by the interactions of the liposomal membrane with components of the immune system Thus understanding the membrane dynamics in SML-liposomes is pivotal in designing long-circulating stable drug carriers which are not only robust but can also avoid enzymatic degradation by the immune system To understand the mechanics of the liposomal membrane on biologically relevant scales we focus on membrane bending fluctuations which have been shown to be directly linked to enzymatic activity13 Membrane bending rigidity can be measured using various techniques but very few can access membrane mechanical properties over the length and time scales of membrane-protein interactions Here we propose Fig 1 A POPC 160-181 B DOPC 181-181 C and D single- and double sterol-modified lipids SCholPC and DCholPC to use neutron spin-echo NSE spectroscopy for direct measurements of bending fluctuations14-16 and corresponding mechanical properties such as bending rigidity  and area compressibility modulus KA The q-range and time scales accessible through NSE allows investigations of effect of sterol-lipid modifications on membrane mechanics over length and time scales that are relevant to biological processes Previous Data and Aim of Proposed Experiments We have previously conducted experiments on DOPC vesicles with various cholesterol content using NSE joint with solid-state 2H-NMR relaxometry Fully-protiated bilayers in D2O buffer provided enhanced contrast to access bending fluctuations In all cases we found that increasing free cholesterol content in membranes led to the well-known condensing effect membrane thickening and reduced area per lipid and Figure 2A and 2B respectively and a long-debated increase in bilayer bending rigidity  Figure 2C Supporting MD simulations and 2H NMR experiments confirmed the observed increase in bending rigidity over the lengthtime scales of NSE further emphasizing the notion of hierarchical dynamics in lipid membranes and the importance of selecting techniques that can probe the dynamics of interest In addition our earlier 2H-NMR experiments revealed that cholesterol-induced increase in  depends on the degree of unsaturation in the acyl chain  increase follows order DMPC17  POPC  DOPC In this proposal we aim to understand the degree by which tail-tethered sterols influence the mechanical properties of POPC and DOPC membranes with single and double mono-unsaturated lipids respectively The results from these experiments have far-reaching implications in sterol modifications of membranes on both biological and technological fronts NSE signals on membranes over a q-range of 045-10 nm-1 yield intermediate structure factors that are fitted to a stretched exponential function to extract the decay rates of membrane dynamics18 The bending rigidity  is calculated from the q-dependent decay rates  using a modified Zilman-Granek model19 with corrections from Watson and Brown20 such that   00069  5X555G55725B5X555G553 as recently used by Nagao et al14 assuming a polymer brush model with interleaflet coupling coefficient   24 Data from such previous measurements on DOPC-cholesterol membranes are shown in Fig 2 However NSE experiments over an extended q-range following the approach of Arriaga et al15 21 allow observations of a transition from pure bending to a hybrid mode from which information about intermonolayer friction coefficient could be extracted In this proposal we will adopt the latter approach Comparison to our just-performed measurements over an extended q-range on cholesterol-enriched DOPC and POPC membranes under analysis will further enable us to evaluate the effect of free vs tethered sterols on membrane bending rigidity as well as interleaflet coupling a key parameter in theories of membrane mechanics Fig 2 A Bilayer thickening and B reduction in area per lipid induced by cholesterol in DOPC membranes C Bending rigidity modulus of DOPC-Chol membranes increases with increasing cholesterol content as obtained from NSE over limited q-range and MD simulations Inset in A shows the SANS plots using perdeuterated DOPC and cholesterol Proposed Experiments In this proposal we aim to study the implications of sterol modified phospholipids SMLs as free cholesterol alternatives on the bending rigidity and interleaflet coupling in liposomal membranes composed of lipids with varying degree of acyl chain unsaturation The set of samples proposed in Table 1 will provide a detailed insight into how SMLs with different chemistries regulate membrane stability and mechanical properties of liposomes Specifically we will consider 2 sets of lipids with varying degrees of unsaturation 1 single monounsaturated POPC 160-181 and 2 double monounsaturated DOPC 181-181 see Fig 1 The target compositions of membranes containing SMLs SCholPC and DCholPC will be calculated such that they replicate equivalent sterol loadings of 20 30 and 50 mol in analogous membranes with free cholesterol All liposome samples will be prepared at 50 mgmL in D2O using thin-film hydration followed by repeated freeze-thaw Liposomes in the form of unilamellar vesicles 100 nm diameter will be generated by extrusion Samples will be loaded in 1 mm titanium NSE cells with quartz windows provided at NCNR and equilibrated at 25oC by a circulating water bath Neutron wavelengths of 11 will be used to access Fourier times up to 100ns and an extended q-range 02-16 nm-1 to access information about bending dynamics and interleaflet coupling as explained by Arriaga et al With the above sample set we request a total of 9 days of NSE beam time including 1 day of resolution and background measurements at the requested instrument configuration For complementary structural characterization of liposomes we request 1 day of SANS beam times 1 hour per sample and background on vSANS full q range or NGB 30m SANS including LENS configuration References 1 Allen T M Cullis P R
