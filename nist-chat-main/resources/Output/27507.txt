Booming gas production from shales in the USA suggests that ultimate recoverable reserves may exceed earlier estimates Recovery of hydrocarbons from shales is making the United States independent from imported oil Shale gas is abundant enough to replace nearly all energy currently obtained from coal combustion and has the benefit of being a hydrogen-rich clean fossil fuel because its combustion releases no toxins produces no ash and emits less carbon dioxide per unit of energy than combustion of coal or oil US EPA 2010 Rapidly growing contributions of gas from unconventional sources are outpacing our scientific understanding of factors that control the amount of gas generated and stored in reservoirs as well as gas producibility Chareonsuppanimit et al 2012 A strengthened scientific basis is needed for developing improved exploration models that can be coupled with an effective production strategy Typically shales are clastic-dominated sedimentary rocks having a dominant grain size of 63 m Shales constitute approximately two-thirds of all sedimentary rocks by volume Schieber 1998 Whereas most shale horizons function as seals for underlying conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs a subset of organic-rich shales has for many years also served as a source of natural gas The first natural gas well in the US tapped Devonian black shales beneath Fredonia New York in 1821 This was almost four decades before the completion of the much better known Drake Oil Well near Titusville Pennsylvania which is considered the birthplace of the oil industry Although shale gas has been produced in the eastern US for more than a century for most of that time its contribution to the overall gas production was marginal Over the past decade shale gas has become a rapidly growing source of natural gas in the US spurred by technological advances such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques Increased shale gas production has been essential in offsetting declining production from conventional gas reservoir US shale gas production accounted for 5  of total US dry gas production in 2004 10  in 2007 and 62  in 2017 EIA 2018 The Barnett Antrim and Fayetteville shale gas reservoirs were initially leading producers but other shale gas plays such as Marcellus Permian Utica Haynesville and Eagle Ford shales have recently joined the ranks In comparison coalbed methane CBM has been extracted from several North American basins for the last 20 years eg Scott et al 1994 Montgomery 1999 Ayers 2002 Flores 2004 and currently accounts for only 5  of total US gas production Improved understanding of the evolution and nature of porosity in shales is needed for predicting gas sorption capacities and gas-in-place volumes Toward this goal we improve the understanding of the multi-modal pore structure in shales and the roles of the organic matter OM content thermal maturity and pressure regime Our ongoing objectives scrutinize the influence of hydrostatic and grain-supported stress and the presence of oilbitumen on porosity The porosity measurements typically represent the volume of pores that are accessible to helium gas under low pressure and at room temperature However shales also contain pores that are closed Indeed recent studies based on neutron scattering techniques suggest that a significant part of pores in shales and coals may not be open Mastalerz et al 2012a Melnichenko et al 2012 and consequently are inaccessible to helium nitrogen carbon dioxide and other gases Moreover it has been demonstrated that the accessibility of pores in rocks can vary widely with both composition and maturity Mastalerz et al 2012a Sakurovs et al 2012 Ruppert et al 2013 Accessibility of pores is very important because pores must be connected to make the rock permeable and to allow the flow of fluids through the rock Therefore the producibility of hydrocarbons is facilitated in shales that have higher pore accessibility In addition to maturity and composition we expect that the accessibility of pores will change in response to changing reservoir conditions such as temperature pressure net confining stress and in response to injection of CO2 or fracking fluid The nature of these changes in accessible porosity however is not known and no data are available to predict them Similarly clit and crack formation is poorly understood yet these processes are essential in the retrieval of gas from these rocks Therefore we propose to investigate all of these factors over the next few years starting with the investigation of the effects of mechanical stress on porosity and crack formation The technique of choice is SANS and Tomography as these techniques allow us to investigate the entire range of pore sizes both open and closed integrated over the entire sample eg Melnichenko et al 2012 To investigate the effects of stress on closed pores we will use Tomography to measure samples at ambient pressure and at the Zero Average Contrast ZAC pressure The study will involve 4 distinctive shale wafers carefully selected for their content and cut to cylinders of 15mm diameter and 40mm height These samples will be investigated using simultaneous X-Ray and neutron radiographs and tomographs so that any changes in porosity can be tracked by x-rays and CD4 penetration of pores can be measured with neutrons We then will apply uniaxial stress at 2 different pressures up to 100 MPa and two different confinement pressures up to 50MPa again followed by an ambient strain Flooding with CD4 will be performed from the vertical direction so the contrast matching technique will allow the diffusion kinetics to be measured at different mechanical strain applied to the sample and the use of X-rays would register any physical changes to the rocks porosity while flooding takes place This will treatment will provide important data identifying any reversible and irreversible changes to porosity as a function of mechanical stress on these rocks The comparison between different samples will inform us at what stress if any closed pores open up and how this changes in shales as a function of maturity and thus composition VSANS data will guide us on the selection of measuring points and we will select conditions where maximal changes are expected Clits and cracks formation are an important irreversible processes we expect to see and the combination of X-Ray and neutron tomography is an ideal machine to track changes occurring in these rocks as they are perturbed by mechanical processes As a full tomograph takes about 8hrs we would require at least 2 days per sample to track the important changes in each sample We thus ask for 8 days of beam time These results will form an important
