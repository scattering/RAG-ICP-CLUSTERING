The aggregation kinetics of alpha-synuclein fibril formation Alpha-synuclein is a 140-amino acid ca 145 kDa intrinsically disordered protein that is naturally present in brain cells Under certain circumstances alpha-synuclein forms long insoluble fibrils which are the hallmark of the Parkinsons disease In vivo alpha-synuclein aggregates in lipid rich environment for which reason investigation of alpha-synuclein-lipid interactions has received significant attention in recent years- The kinetic pathways of fibril formation process of alpha-synuclein are still not fully understood but it has been demonstrated that the fibril formation process is influenced by the presence of various lipid membranes- Previous studies showed that alpha-synuclein binds to lipid membranes  but it is still not clear how lipids impact the process of protein aggregation Contrast matching neutron experiment could help us gain more insight in this impact Preliminary results were obtained at NIST Centre for Neutron Research NCNR at NG7 SANS instrument Experiments were conducted to investigate protein-lipid co-assemblies when alpha-synuclein monomers are incubated together with vesicles of different lipid content and charge One of the lipid systems studied was combination of DMPC zwitterionic and DMPS anionic lipids standing in a molar ratio DMPCDMPS91 Investigated were fibrils formed in the presence of different vesicle concentrations Results obtained at NCNR suggest that alpha-synuclein fibrillate in the presence of these vesicles Figure 1 Higher intensity in the case of higher lipid concentration suggest interaction between protein and lipids during aggregation process and formation of protein-lipid co-assembly Thereby we propose time-resolved SANS experiment where we would investigate the fibrillation mechanism of alpha-synuclein in the presence of DMPCDMPS vesicles We propose to do experiments on vSANS which covers a wide q-range due to its combination of several detectors This wide q-range is necessary in the present case as the process involves species with different length scales Monomers have a radius of gyration of ca 3 nm Fibrils will grow to several 100 nm in length during the experiment And then in between there are the particularly interesting oligomers because of their proposed cytotoxicity having length scales of the order of 10 nm In order to fully characterize the fibril formation process we need to follow the time evolution of the different species We propose to use protonated protein and deuterated lipids in essentially pure D2O buffer which would allow us to highlight protein part of the possible protein-lipid co-assembly by contrast matching the vesicles Unlike our previous end-point experiments we would start SANS measurements immediately after mixing alpha-synuclein monomers with vesicles We are interested in studying the fibril formation process at two biologically relevant pH values The interest in studying two different pH values originates from the fact that it has been proposed that different fibril morphologies can be obtained at different pH values We also propose to study an effect of vesicle charge different DMPCDMPS ratios on the aggregation kinetics By monitoring ThT a molecule that fluoresce when bound to beta-sheet structures present in alpha-synuclein fibrils but not monomers emission it was shown that half of the monomers initial monomer concentration equal to 28 M aggregate within ca t12  23 h It was also shown that the presence of lipids accelerates fibril formation and that the aggregation rate also increases strongly with increasing protein concentration  In the proposed time resolved experiments we will have to work at significantly higher protein concentrations typically several 100 M with t12 values of the order of a couple of hours We have started to perform a detailed ThT kinetics study Figure 2 in our home laboratory in order to identify the precise protein concentrations and different conditions lipid concentration lipid composition pH in order to have fibrillation completed within ca 6 h For the time resolved SANS experiments we thus plan ca 6 h maximum measurements per sample with 15 minutes sampling In total we will measure 9-10 different samples In a first set we will measure two different lipid compositions DMPDMP 01  02 and 3 different pH values in the range 55-65 in order to study whether the molecular pathways final fibril structure and the structure of possible intermediates depend on those conditions In a second set we will choose a given lipid composition and pH and vary the protein concentration At least three concentrations will be studied We propose to measure at 37 C Data will be analyzed on absolute scale using SasView and our own MatLab codes The q-dependent scattering pattern will be analyzed and modelled to obtain information of oligomer size and shape and how they relate to the mature fibrils at a later stage Monomers will be modelled as random coils We also expect to be able to see at what stage in the process aggregation of fibrils into clusters occurs which we expect to happen at least at pH55 To complete this study we ask for 3 full days of beamtime on vSANS We will need to run the sample through size exclusion chromatography prior to the measurements in order to remove contamination of already formed fibrils and ensure well defined initial state of monomers only Data obtained from this experiment would be part of the main proposers Marija Dubackic PhD thesis Marija is PhD student at Lund University within
