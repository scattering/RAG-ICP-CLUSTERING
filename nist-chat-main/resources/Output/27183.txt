Topology and crystalline electrical field effects in the half-Heusler compounds YPdBi and YPtBi We propose to study the crystalline electrical field CEF evolution along the half-Heusler series more specifically focusing in the Nd3- and Er3-doped YPdBi and YPtBi compounds by inelastic neutron scattering INS measurements which probes directly the CEF excitations Previous results obtained by electron spin resonance ESR and magnetic susceptibility analyses have pointed out to a possible CEF evolution along the series which could be related to the topological nature of these compounds  Our main objective is to measure the compounds Y09Nd01PdBi Y09Er01PdBi Y09Nd01PtBi Y09Er01PtBi and its nonmagnetic starting compounds YPdBi and YPtBi in order to extract the phonon contribution The CEF excitations should be in the 0-50 meV range and this study is best suited to BT-7 using the horizontally focusing monochromator and analyzer systems due to the excitations being dispersionless A new quantum state of matter the three dimensional topological insulators 3D TIs  has attracted a lot of interest due to their possible applications and remarkable physical properties The nontrivial insulators that have metallic surface states protected from backscattering and highly spin polarized channels have triggered a new area of research One of the first platforms to be pointed as a 3D TI was the RMT R  rare-earth M  Pd Pt or Au and T  Bi Sb half-Heusler family which has a cubic non-centrosymmetric MgAgAs structure Previous band structure calculations 3 show that the topology inside this family could be tuned by changes in the M or T atoms as shown in Fig 1 The change of the M or T atoms alters the volume of the unitary cell andor the spin-orbit coupling and as a consequence their interplay could be responsible for the band inversion between a 8 p-character and a 6 s-character bands which lies near the Fermi level In trivial compounds the 8 band lies below the Fermi level and is mainly formed by p-type electrons The two-fold degenerate 6 band on the other hand has a contribution from s- and d- electrons 3 It is important to notice that the members of this family have 18 valence electrons d10  s2  p6 It is well known that beyond the point charge model conduction electrons have a significant contribution to the CEF effects and consequently to the crystalline field parameters CFP due to the direct and exchange Coulomb interactions 5- Generally the major contributors to the CFP would come from the bands near the Fermi level 5 and in particular d electrons contribute differently depending whether they are above or below the Fermi level  Previous results obtained by our group points out to a possible inversion of the sign of the fourth A4 and sixth A6 order cubic CFPs when we compare Nd3- and Er3- doped YPdBi and YPtBi 191 This result points to the possibility of the CEF effects probing the change of the charge distribution surrounding the local moments which should be a result of the changes of the type of carriers near the Fermi level due to the distinct band inversion comparing YPdBi and YPtBi Fig 1 Band inversion as a function of the volume of the unitary cell in the half-Heusler family Figure adapted from Ref  In order to extract the cubic CFP parameters firstly we check the CEF ground state and the distance in energy to the first CEF excited state of each local moment using ESR Electron spin resonance is a site-specific spectroscopic technique which can probe locally the CEF effects of a local moment We can extract the intensity I of a resonance which is connected with the number of resonant spins the line width H which is connected with relaxation mechanisms the g-value from the resonance field Hr which is closely related with the CEF ground state and internal fields and the line shape which can be related to the metallic character of the system 1 As an example Fig 2 shows the Nd3 ESR spectra of Nd3-doped YPdBi From the g-value of the central line we can identify the CEF ground state which is a 6 state The same analyses have been made to the other compounds and the results are summarized in Table I 191 Fig 3 a shows the ESR T-dependence of the line width H for Nd3- and Er3-doped YPdBi The exponential broadening of the line width H as a function of temperature is associated with the first excited CEF states being involved in the spin-lattice relaxation In this example assuming a phonon-mediated mechanism Orbach process 1 we can extract the energy separation between the ground and the first excited states These values are summarized in Table I for doped YPdBi and YPtBi The precise determinations of the CEF ground state and the energy separation to the first excited CEF state are two relevant microscopic information probed by ESR It provides important constrains in order to obtain the Nd3 and Er3 CEF schemes for each compound Fig 3 b shows an example of the CEF effects extracted from magnetic susceptibility for Y09Er01PdBi Assuming a cubic CEF Hamiltonian plus a Zeeman term we obtain the best fits to the data 1 The -1 is the inverse magnetic susceptibility of the free ion magnetic

parameters x and W 1 we can obtain the CEF scheme for each compound which is summarized in Table I Normally we obtain from our data analysis the CFPs B4 and B6 In order to compare different CFPs from different ions we rewrite Bn  An rn n where rn is the mean n powers of the distance radius between the 4f electrons and the rare-earth nucleus and n is an appropriate scale parameter for each ion 1 Looking to the An for each ion in each compound we can compare the charge distribution probed by the CFPs As summarized in Table I the CFPs A4 obtained for YPdBi are systematically higher by one order of magnitude than the YPtBi A4 The difference is probably associated with the greater metallic character of YPtBi andor with small changes of the lattice parameters Compound A4 K A6 K G S 1st E S 2nd

difference in the sign of the effective surrounding charges at the R-site This is possibly due to a change of the carrier contribution types of electronsholes near the Fermi level which goes into the direction of the previous band structure calculations 3 Supposedly when the band inversion occurs the p-type electrons are no longer the only responsible for the formation of the residual Fermi surface with s- and more likely d- electrons starting to play a bigger role This is a direct consequence of the band inversion driven by the spin-orbit coupling For this proposed experiment to confirm our results we have prepared over 5 grams of high-quality single crystals Bi-flux grown for each of the six proposed systems doped samples and undoped samples to determine the phonon contribution The powdered samples will be placed in an annulus can to reduce the absorption effects We are requesting eight days on BT-7 instrument to perform the experiment for six samples in three different temperatures between 4 K and 300 K to be able to probe all the excited states using a closed cycle refrigerator The BT-7 instrument has a high flux beam which is ideal for the study of CEF excitations
