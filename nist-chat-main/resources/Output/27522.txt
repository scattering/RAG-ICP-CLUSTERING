 1 Study of Zero Average Contrast Method for Diblock Copolymers Yuan Wei Michael JA Hore Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering Case Western Reserve University Introduction and Motivation The zero average contrast ZAC method is focused on decoupling the correlations between composition fluctuations and concentration fluctuations This method was designed to extract single chain properties for a deuterated polymer in a matrix of identical but hydrogenated chains and using the small-angle neutron scattering SANS technique1 Previous work by Hammouda2 applied ZAC to a mixture of deuterated and hydrogenated polyN-isopropylacrylamide PNIPAM dissolved in mixtures of D2O and H2O to match the solvent average scattering length density SLD and the polymers average SLD For the normal SANS data the intensity is enhanced when the temperature is increased The reason is that the PNIPAM phase separates upon heating and demixes around 32  which is Lower Critical Solution Temperature LCST behavior However when this system is studied with the ZAC condition the intensity will remain almost constant even though the temperature changes These data can prove the ZAC condition achieved2 The ZAC condition allows the elimination of the signal coming from the structure factor the intercorrelations to see only the single-chain conformation This is shown schematically in Figure 1 the structure factor effect top was eliminated so the intensity will not be changed under ZAC condition bottom The result of these measurements was observation of the collapse of PNIPAM chains as the sample is heated which is not normally possible with SANS due to strong clustering of the PNIPAM Applying the ZAC condition to homopolymers is well-understood and robust at this point However to date this method has not been applied to diblock copolymers Hammouda has recently developed the mathematics for applying ZAC to diblock copolymers When applied to diblock copolymers the ZAC condition can be utilized to measure the conformation of a single block of the polymer This process is distinct from contrast matching because it allows one to extract a single blocks conformation under conditions where the chains may aggregate or self-assemble or in which there are strong interactions between polymer and solvent In the case of PNIPAM it is well-known that clustering of the chains is observed below the LCST The ZAC condition can help to only see one block conformation clearly and isolate the second block effect by hiding the second block signal The ZAC method will be useful in the future we may be able to investigate the polymer chain conformation when the polymer associates with other components such as polymers grafted to the surface of the nanoparticles In addition development of this method may be key for detailed structural studies of protein-polymer conjugates3 In this proposal we are requesting beamtime to establish the validity of ZAC measurements of diblock copolymers and bring this technique to the polymer community Figure 1 Homopolymer under Zero Average Contrast condition The top image represents scattering from an aggregate of two homopolymers Under ZAC conditions bottom only the single chain is measured 2 Proposed Work We propose to use polystyrene PS blocked with polyN-isopropylacrylamide PNIPAM as our sample with THF as a solvent We have confirmed the chains do not form micelles in this solvent by DLS Polystyrene has a similar Kuhn segment size to PNIPAM because they have close characteristic ratios of 103 and 117 respectively This condition significantly simplifies the mathematics of the diblock ZAC We propose measurements of these samples in a standard configuration on either the NG7 or NGB 30 m instruments over a Q-range of 0003 to 04 -1 This is typically done with 13 m 4 m and 1 m sample-to-detector distances We require the use of the 9-position heatingcooling block as a sample environment All PS-b-PNIPAM diblock polymers have already been synthesized by reversible additionfragmentation chain-transfer polymerization RAFT with   12 Their structures are shown in Figure 2 In addition to the diblocks we have synthesized PS and PNIPAM homopolymers to assist in confirming the contrast match points The molecular weight for each block of the diblock polymer is approximately 25-30 kgmol as measured by SEC-MALS Figure 2 left to right hPS-b-hPNIPAM dPS-b-hPNIPAM hPS-b-dPNIPAM For the ZAC method we describe the scattering by a sample composed of PNIPAM component 1 and PS component 2 as where and S22 and S12 are the intrachain and interchain structure factor terms respectively Contrast matching causes these terms to go to zero To do this the scattering length density of block 2 r2 must match that of the solvent rs This contrast match condition will be determined by SANS measurements of hPS in blends of hTHF and dTHF near the theoretical match point 78 hTHF 22 dTHF to find the minimum in forward scattering intensity Although the contrast match point contains a significant amount of hydrogen which would impact the ZAC measurements described below a SASCALC calculation figure 3 shows that at our concentrations we can obtain a reasonable scattering signal with 1 hour of total counting per sample On the basis of previous SANS experiments we estimate our incoherent background will fall between 005 and 100 cm-1 We anticipate that 6 samples are sufficient to interpolate the contrast match point  6 hours of beam time When the first contrast match condition is obtained scattering from the sample is described by The ZAC condition causes the second term of the above equation shown in pink go to zero leaving 11 22 122d d ddd d d dS S SS  W W W W2222 22 SdSdr rS  -W121

measurement will fall between the red deuterated solvent and blue hydrogenated solvent limits only the single chain form factor term containing PSQ The theoretical requirement for the ZAC condition is a mixture of 82 hPNIPAM-b-dPS with 18 dPNIPAM-b-dPS On the basis of our SASCALC simulation this amount of hydrogen in our sample is acceptable to obtain adequate scattering intensities for analysis For our ZAC measurements we will first measure the PNIPAM block ZAC condition We use the mixture of hPS-b-dPNIPAM and hPS-b-hPNIPAM as the sample We dissolve the polymer mixture in the mixture of deuterated THF dTHF and hydrogenated THF hTHF We will vary the percentage of hTHF to dTHF from approximately 72 to 82 to obtain the contrast match point and vary the percentage of hPNIPAM to dPNIPAM from 77 to 87 To most accurately find the ZAC conditions we propose dividing these ranges into 10 samples each resulting in a total of 20 samples  24 hours of beam time Next we will measure the reverse condition to find the PS block ZAC condition ie PS as component 1 PNIPAM as component 2 We will use d6-PNIPAM blocked with PS to reduce the amount of hydrogen in the sample The theoretical contrast match point for d6-PNIPAM is 26 hTHF and 74 dTHF and we estimate that 6 hours of beamtime is sufficient for determining this point The ZAC sample is the mixture of dPS-b-dPNIPAM and hPS-b-dPNIPAM and we estimate that the ZAC condition is 42 hPS and 58 dPS We propose determining the ZAC condition by varying the hTHF percentage from 20 to 30 and the hPS percentage from 37 to 47 We again propose dividing these ranges into 10 samples each resulting in a total of 20 samples 24 hours of beam time After we determine the ZAC conditions for both blocks of the diblock copolymers separately we will then measure the ZAC samples as a function of temperature from 10  C to 50  C in 10  C increments to extract the temperature dependence of the conformation of each block ie 10 samples total  12 hours of beam time Total request 12 hours contrast match  48 hours zero average contrast  12 hours conformation measurements  3 days of beam time References 1 Benmouna Mustapha and
