Study of LiLLTO solid electrolyte interfaces Lithium ion batteries are ubiquitous in modern technology with their applications ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles On the basis of the well-established liquid electrolyte battery technology increasing effort is being made to develop the next generation all solid-state battery system which has higher energy density and is safer as it eliminates the use of flammable liquid electrolytes preventing the formation of Li dendrites that bridge across the electrodes Of course the introduction of all solid-state Li batteries brings new challenges One of the grand challenges in solid battery systems is the successful implementation of high energy density Li metal anodes However because lithium is an extremely reactive metal it can sometimes intercalate into the solid-electrolyte material which will lead to pronounced interfacial reactions that could result in reducing the ionic conductivity and increasing the interfacial impedance causing capacity fade Although it is important to study the stability of lithium against the electrolyte effects of crystal orientations and crystallinity of solid electrolyte are generally ignored However our recent study on LLTO Li033La055TiO3 solid electrolyte - Li metal interfaces showed that the orientation and crystallinity has a huge impact on the interfacial reactivity With respect to the orientational aspect Li can migrate along the c-axis in the LLTO structure therefore causing different amounts of Ti4 reduction for different orientations see Fig 1 Figure 1 Ti 2p HAXPES core level spectra after sputtering a 10 nm thick film of Li on LLTO show reduction of Ti from Ti4 to Ti3 The amount of Ti reduced differs with orientation Figure 2 a XAS of crystalline LLTO films after contacting Li typical for a mixture of Ti4 and Ti3 indicating Ti in the bulk of the film is reduced b XPS and c XAS spectrum of amorphous LLTO film after contacting Li metal showed both surface and bulk was not reduced by Li as spectra are typical for Ti4 In our studies epitaxial films grown with pulsed laser deposition PLD have been characterized with in-plane and out-of-plane X-ray diffraction X-ray photoelectron and adsorption spectroscopy We find that the ordered La vacancy along the c-axis was maintained in the film structure evidenced by the observation of superlattice peak For 001 oriented LLTO film grown on NdGaO3 110 the La ordered vacancy is along surface normal direction and for 100 oriented LLTO film on SrTiO3100 the La ordered vacancy is in-plane As Li preferably intercalates into the film along the ordered La vacancy c-axis direction 001 oriented LLTO films should be most unstable when in contact with lithium As expected sputtered metallic Li reduced 33 Ti in the bulk of 001 LLTO film whereas the LLTO 100 film has only 13  Ti reduced as shown in Fig 1 Although LLTO exhibits orientation-dependent differences in reactivity after short-term exposure to thin 10nm thick Li films as shown in Fig 1 long-term reaction 3 days with excess Li 07 mm thick foil eventually results in identical bulk reduction behavior regardless of orientation Fig 2a XAS spectra collected for four different orientations of LLTO hkl films reveal a similar amount of Ti reduction Ti3Ti4 and lattice expansion for all four orientations indicating that the orientation-dependent differences observed above are kinetic rather than thermodynamic in origin This stands in contrast to amorphous LLTO thin films which surprisingly exhibit no evidence of surface reactivity after deposition of thin Li films as shown with surface sensitive XPS Fig 2b Even more surprisingly no reactivity is observed in the bulk of the film XAS Fig 2c even after 3 days of contact with a thick lithium foil as the XAS spectrum is indicative of only Ti4 As the same LLTO PLD target was used to deposit amorphous and LLTO hkl films we do not expect significant differences in bulk stoichiometry but there might be some composition deviations near the surface resulting in the observed differences in reactivity As amorphous LLTO has previously been reported to have similar ionic conductivity to its crystalline counterpart 105 Scm this suggests that amorphous materials may represent a promising path forward towards realizing conductive solid electrolytes with reduced interfacial reactivity To better understand the observed interfacial reaction it is important to understand changes or differences in chemical composition and structure in these films and their impact on real battery system Therefore we are proposing to perform neutron reflectometry studies on these systems as neutron reflectometry is sensitive to variations in composition as a function of depth into the film We aim to study LLTO films with different crystal orientations and crystallinity of LLTO coated with or exposed to different amounts of Li to determined the Figure 3 AFM roughness measurement on bare LLTO films in 100 001 orientation depth dependent profile of the Li intercalation into the LLTO layer We want to determine if there is a different depth dependence of the intercalated Li which leads to reduction of Ti which could explain some of the differences observed in Fig 1 with crystallinity Due to the negative coherent scattering length of Li neutron reflectivity will be quite sensitive to changes in the Li concentration in the film as it can change the scattering length density at a certain depth in the film For example assuming all the vacancies in the material are filled with Li the scattering length density would change by 4 Secondly we are interested in studying the films as a function of time after exposure to Li to understand the kinetics Especially in the case of amorphous LLTO it would also be interesting to perform such studies as a function of temperature as changes in conductivity by a factor of a 100 have been observed when increasing the temperature to 90 C and even larger changes are expected Ultimately we would like to do in-situ measurements as a function of electric field and after electric field cycling The purpose of this proposal is to request beamtime for neutron reflectometry experiments using the MAGIK reflectometer Overall we wish to measure thin LiLLTO films with different crystal orientations 100 001 110 112 of LLTO and amorphous LLTO as achieved by growth on different substrates SrTiO3111 110 100 NdGaO3110 and Si Epitaxial LLTO thin films 120 nm thick have been deposited in different orientations on the substrates using pulsed laser deposition PLD XRD measurements have been used to confirm the crystal orientation of the films Thin layers of Li are added using e-beam physical vapor deposition or thicker Li foil 07 mm thick can be placed on the sample surface prior to the experiment for the kinetic studies The samples are 05 x 05 cm2 and due to the small area require 1 day of beamtime each We therefor ask for 5 days of beamtime for a first round of experiments at room temperature Time permitting we will also measure the amorphous LLTO at elevated temperatures As experiments with an electric field require a more challenging sample environment we plan to submit a proposal for those experiments in a future call As the samples are relatively small those future experiments would also benefit from the CANDOR instruments increased intensity after that instrument has been commissioned
