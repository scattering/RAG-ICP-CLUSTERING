Figure 1 a Schematic of device operation b out-of-plane hysteresis loops measured using the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect MOKE zero gate bias and positive gate bias hydrogen loaded Magneto-ionic control of thin-film magnetism through solid-state voltage-gated protonation We propose to perform polarized neutron reflectometry on proton-gated ferromagnetoxide heterostructures to extract the proton concentration profile and magnetization depth profile under well-controlled operating conditions The experiments will lead to fundamental and practical insights into this newly-discovered means to control magnetism by gate voltage in solid-state heterostructures Background Dynamic switching of material properties using a gate voltage provides an important means to achieve new functionalities in thin-film heterostructures and devices Solid-state electrical gating of magnetic properties allows for control of spin-based devices for memory logic and sensor applications Recently there has been the transition from purely electronic to electrochemical effects1-5 In thin film ferromagnetoxide heterostructures chemical structure at the interface can be controlled through electric field driven solid-state ion transport which substantially influences magnetic properties such as magnetic anisotropy12 magnetic moment1-3 exchange bias4 and spin-orbit torque5 So far most work has relied upon electric field driven O2- ion displacement to modulate interfacial or bulk oxidation states1-5 with concomitant changes in magnetic properties Unfortunately oxygen transport in solid-oxide electrolytes is generally slow and requires elevated temperatures12 and chemical and structural changes accompanying O2- displacement can lead to irreversibility and device degradation3 We have recently demonstrated the first hydrogen-based magneto-ionic devices6 in which interfacial magnetism is modulated by reversible proton gating of buried magnetic metaloxide and metalmetal interfaces see Fig 1 Protons have a higher mobility and can be inserted into thin-film structures with far less stress than O2- We showed that H2O hydrolysis in ambient atmosphere catalyzed by a GdOxAu interface can serve as a solid-state proton pump that enables nondestructive magnetic property gating with a modest voltage We demonstrated 90o magnetization switching in Pt4nmCo1nmGdOx30nmAu3nm films at room temperature by hydrogen loading and unloading The mechanism permits both unipolar toggle switching and nonvolatile state retention with robust operation for 2000 cycles The underlying mechanism of water splitting and proton injection has been confirmed through controlled environmental testing6 and the use of target layers such as Mg whose electronic and optical properties can be switched by hydrogen loading7 Importantly since protons can diffuse through both oxides and metals this mechanism allows for gating a range of interfacial spin-orbital phenomena mediated by heavy metals Pt and Pd which can be driven between a metal and metal-hydride phase Recently we discovered that a gate voltage can induce 180-degree switching of the Nel vector of a ferrimagnet by solid-state ionic gating We examined the effect of voltage-controlled hydrogen gating in Ta4nmPd3nmGdCo6nmPd10nmGdOx30nmAu3nm films grown on thermally oxidized Si We found that the compensation temperature of GdCo can be lowered by 100C and at room temperature the sign of MOKE contrast and the polarity of AHE loop can be switched reversibly With a fixed perpendicular bias field a gate voltage can induce 180-degree Nel vector switching Moreover because the approach allows for localized control we achieved reverse domain and skyrmion generation on racetrack-like devices This type of material is highly attractive for spintronics applications because it shows the highest domain wall velocities and the smallest skyrmions observed at room temperature10 Proposed Experiments So far studies of proton insertion into magneto-ionic heterostructures have been indirect owing to the challenge of directly detecting hydrogen in a depth-resolved way Polarized neutron reflectivity PNR is ideal for this challenge since the bound coherent nuclear scattering length of hydrogen is negative making it possible to extract depth-dependent hydrogen profiles under operating conditions together with magnetic depth profiles to understand the relations between the two Open questions include 1 how are protons transported through and stored in the oxide 2 to what extent is their incorporation reversible 3 what are the roles of absorbed water and injected protons on interfacial magneto-ionic reactions and 4 to what extent is hydrogen incorporated into adjacent heavy metal layers and how does this influence interfacial spin-orbit phenomena Water plays two critical roles in these devices First water from airborne humidity acts as the source of protons for magnetic property modulation a positive gate bias at the top Au electrode splits water and injects protons through the GdOx to the Co interface68 Second hydration of GdOx by exposure to humidity transforms it into a mixed oxide-hydroxide phase with high room-temperature proton conductivity9 Preliminary x-ray reflectivity XRR measurements Fig 2 show a chemical expansion and density change upon exposure of GdOx to humidity consistent with a chemical transformation to GdOH3 which correlates with the onset of fast magneto-ionic switching when devices are subsequently gated by voltage Preliminary neutron reflectivity NR experiments at the NCNR PBR beamline showed the same film expansion and confirmed the presence and growth of a top layer of highly hydrated oxide during exposure to high humidity Fig 3 These unpolarized NR measurements have demonstrated that the films have sufficiently small roughness and appropriate thickness for high-quality PNR spectra Figure 2 a XRR spectra of a non-hydrated and hydrated GdOx film 144 h of exposure to high-humidity b Extracted scattering length density profiles of the GdOx film as a function of hydration time 90C at 525Torr PH2O cd Polar MOKE hysteresis loops of non-hydrated and hydrated device in virgin state and under gate voltage Our next set of experiments will provide depth profiles of both structurally-incorporated water and of subsequently injected protons Experiments will use an existing series of Ta4nmPt3nmCo09 nmGdOxtGdOx nm films fabricated on thermally oxidized Si 100 substrates by sputtering deposition PNR spectra will be obtained to accurately determine the depth profile of incorporated water in the gate oxide similar to the NR measurements that were previously performed on large-area hydrated GdOx films Devices will then be gated under positive bias and subsequently negative bias to injectremove protons and examined in remanence after biasing All measurements will be made at room temperature in an in-plane saturating field of 07T The depth profile of injected protons and stored hydrogen will be extracted These experiments will show to what extent protons are injected through wet and dry GdOx the depth profile within the GdOx and at the GdOxCo interface and the reversibility of proton injectionremoval during gating Each measurement requires approximately 24 hours of beamtime for full polarization analysis so we require 6 days for 2 samples measured before gating after positive gating and after negative gating The second set of experiments will correlate the hydrogen profile in heavy metalferromagnet heterostructures with the magnetic properties saturation magnetization and magnetic orientation Devices similar to those described above will be fabricated by sputter deposition using demonstrated capabilities at MIT Heterostructures of the type Ta4nmPt or P4nmCo1nmPd or P4nmGdOx30nmAu3nm will be fabricated with four combinations of top and bottom heavy metal layer Pd and Pt are chosen because each can be hydrogenated but the spin-orbit effects from Pt are larger than for Pd Diffusion and storage profiles of hydrogen in these devices will be correlated with the magnetic depth profile and with subsequent measurements of magnetic switching and spin-orbit torques at MIT We request two additional days for preliminary characterization of these samples prior to gating Our total request is for 8 days of beamtime References
