of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg MD 20899 Background Polyimides PIs have been widely used in industrial fields such as aerospace and electronics due to excellent dielectric response mechanical and thermal stability and chemical resistance PIs are synthesized in two steps using dianhydride and diamine as monomers The first step is synthesis of polyamic acid PAA by adding dianhydride to a diamine solution in a polar aprotic solvent such as NN-dimethylformamide DMF NN-dimethylacetamide DMAc and Nmethylpyrrolidone NMP The second step is often carried out by heating the generated PAA often in the form of filmsthe imidization step The two-step process is schematically shown in Scheme 1 using the classical Kapton PI as an example the two monomers are pyromellitic dianhydride PMDA and 44-oxydianiline ODA Scheme 1 Routine of Kapton PI synthesis Pyromellitic dianhydride PMDA and 44oxydianiline ODA are used as monomers  Seen from the backbone structure PI chains are very rigid As a matter of fact glass transition temperatures Tg are very high for PIstypically greater than 600 K depending on the chain architectures This means that PI products are mostly used in its glassy state Thus understanding chain packing and local dynamics of PI at temperatures far below Tg is of critical importance in designing and processing PI materials The proposed quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS experiments utilizing both disc chopper DCS and back-scattering HFBS techniques are aimed to probe dynamics in the time scale of pico-second to nano-second namely the fast relaxation process We have been carrying out in parallel structural characterizations of glassy PIs by using various X-ray scattering techniques including pair-distribution function method We expect to combine both structure and dynamics studies and try to link the results to materials properties Goals and significance The proposed investigation tries to compare fast relaxation process of PI films with different chain packing states Here chain packing refers mostly to non-crystalline structures including amorphous and mesophorphic phases PI films are largely non-crystalline due to remarkable chain rigidity On the other hand complex chain interactions such as charge transfer complex interaction induce formation of mesomorphic phases featuring broad intensity humps in both SAXS and WAXS profiles The chain packing details are still not well understood Chains are highly mobile in the PAA precursor but the final structure is largely set once the imidization step is completed  Nevertheless we found that local chain density in the PI can be varied to some extent by varying the film thickness of the precursor X-ray small angle scattering and diffraction profiles from films of different thickness show variations in peak positions breadths and intensities data not shown here Thinner films are more amorphous and have more free volume and looser packing Therefore the significance of the proposed study is twofold First we plan to link the structural characteristics from XRD and SAXS to the local dynamics to help understand macroscopic properties of practical importance such as thermal expansion and loss modulus Second from a fundamental viewpoint PIs are ideal polymers for studying fast relaxation processes far below Tg which is a topic still under debate According to mode-coupling theory there is a critical temperature Tc above which a slow process termed the -process and a fast process termed the MCT -process not to be confused with the Johari-Goldstein -process coexist whilst only the fast process survives at temperatures below Tc Whether the fast process is a precursor of the  -process is still an issue being discussed PIs provide an opportunity to examine the fast process separately also free from the interference from methyl group dynamics 5 Samples QENS experiments and beamtime request We plan to measure 3 Kapton PI films with different thickness The Kapton films were synthesized at DuPont Sample thicknesses are 15 60 and 130 microns Glass transition temperature is between 633 K and 683 K as measured in calorimetry experiment For thin films multiple films will be stacked rolled and mounted in aluminum sample cells For each film a fixed window scans will be performed first Then quasi-elastic scattering experiment will be performed at 5 selected temperatures in DCS we expect to trace the transition from the Boson peak to quasi-elastic broadening Thus for each film we need 6 measurements in total which would consume 2 days of beamtime assuming 8 h are spent on each measurement To complete the set of experiment for 3 films 6 days of beamtime are need Therefore We request 7 days of beamtime in total Considering time spent on setting up and sample changing Perhaps it is beneficial to complete the proposed experiments in two trips Reference  Takekoshi T Synthesis of Polyamides In Ghosh M K and Mittal K L Eds Polyimides- Fundamentals and
