Probing Variation in Crosslink Density with Depth in Atmospheric Plasma Polymerized Thin Films Objective The objective is to understand how the crosslink density depth profile in films produced for organosilane precursors with atmospheric-pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition AP-PECVD differs from that films produced with vacuum PECVD and also varies for AP-PECVD films with carbon content achieved in the films Background In PECVD monomers are introduced into a reactor in or near plasma Interaction with the plasma results in fragmentation of the monomer into reactive species These reactive species are carried by a stream of inert gas to the surface of a substrate where they react with other species to form a highly crosslinked polymer Thin films prepared by AP-PECVD have attractive properties such as freedom from pinhole defects resistance to dissolution by virtue of crosslinking and good adhesion to variety of substrates These properties and the minimal amount of surface preparation required to deposit the films has piqued the interest of the corrosion science community AP-PECVD films have shown promise in corrosion tests but optimizing their performance as corrosion resistant films requires an understanding of the film structure in particular the crosslinking in the film and how it varies with depth Initial X-ray reflectivity XR measurements of AP-PECVD homopolymer films made from the monomer hexamethyldisiloxane HMDSO suggest that their chemical structure is uniform with depth except for a ca 1 nm thick transition layer next to the substrate and the airfilm interface is smooth XR provides some sensitivity to variations in mass density with depth but provides no sensitivity to crosslink density which is the focus of the current study Neutron reflectometry NR on the other hand can be exquisitely sensitive to variations in crosslink density with depth in films swollen in solvent if deuteration is appropriately used as shown by Kent and coworkers  and Foster and coworkers 2 Measurements made at NIST in 2007 by the authors revealed non-uniform swelling of a vacuum plasma-polymerized film made from OFCB PP-OFCB and swollen in deuterated THF vapor From the non-uniform swelling the variations in crosslink density with depth were inferred 2 The proposed measurements address whether AP-PECVD films also display variations in crosslink density with depth In addition we consider how the AP-PECVD film crosslink density depth profile varies with the carbon content of the film We anticipate that higher carbon content is preferable for resisting water encroachment to the interface with the film substrate but it is completely unknown how a varying CO may be related to crosslinking structure Methods Vacuum PECVD films will be deposited on silicon wafers using HMDSO precursor in a home built vacuum reactor Samples of AP-PECVD films with varying carbon contents will be deposited from various precursors including HMDSO with a Surfx Atomflo 500 atmospheric plasma apparatus They will be characterized by XR and AFM in Fosters laboratory before being studied with NR so that dry film thickness and interface roughnesses have been independently determined Each sample will be measured by NR first in the dry state then exposed to a saturated deuterated solvent vapor in an aluminum sample chamber with sample mount that is available at NIST After the sample has had time to swell to an equilibrium state NR will be measured again The time required to reach equilibrium swelling will be studied before the neutron beam time using separate XR measurements At NIST two chambers will be used so that one sample can swell while another is being measured Comparison of the scattering length density SLD profiles obtained in the dry and swollen states will provide indications of the uniformity of swelling with depth and thus variation of crosslinking density with depth Obtaining a single reflectivity curve with background will require about 10 hours To set up and run both dry and swollen measurements for 6 samples 12 runs we estimate a total requirement of about 5 days Expected Results Analysis will provide an estimate of the variation in solvent content with depth which can be related to the uniformity in crosslink density with depth We expect that crosslink density will vary with depth with the strongest gradient occurring near the substrate where preliminary XR data have indicated a variation in chemical composition or density apparently associated with a transient in the deposition phenomenon We hypothesize that the films with higher carbon content will have lower average crosslink density and also different gradients in crosslink density at the interfaces References 1 Yim H et al Macromolecules 1999 32 7932 2 Peri SR Habersberger B Akgun B Jiang H Enlow J Bunning TJ Majkrzak CF Foster MD Polymer 2010 51 4390-4397 3 Peri SR Akgun B Satija SK Jiang H Enlow J Bunning TJ Foster MD ACS Appl Mater Interfaces 2011 3 3375-3383
