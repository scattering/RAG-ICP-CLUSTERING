Study of the magnetic excitations in the cobalt honeycomb lattice material Li2CoP2S6 Introduction Recently attention has been focused on two-dimensional honeycomb lattice materials with magnetic ions presenting a strong spin-orbit coupling In particular these materials hosting magnetic ions with a pseudospin-12 ground state doublet and exhibiting bond-directional exchange interactions are thought to display unconventional magnetism and form a new class of materials called Kitaev materials  These materials are unique as the predicted groundstate is a quantum spin liquid Numerous studies have mostly explored Kitaev physics in 4d and 5d compounds such as iridates and -RuCl3 1- which do not have electrons in the eg orbitals simplifying the interactions between the magnetic ions However it has recently been suggested that Co2 based materials may also realise Kitaev interaction and may be good candidates for quantum spin liquids We propose to investigate the low energy excitations in a Co2 honeycomb material which does not show any signs of magnetic order according to thermodynamic measurements Scientific context The general Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian describing spins interacting in a honeycomb lattice is given by where ijg denotes the three inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds for the honeycomb lattice The Kitaev coupling K originates from the combined effects of the anion-mediated super-exchange and the Hunds coupling The G and J terms correspond to anisotropic and Heisenberg exchange terms respectively  In most systems studied so far in the 4d and 5d elements the last two terms induce a magnetically ordered ground state as reported in most of the material candidates 2- In the proposed compound the magnetic ion Co2 has 7 d-electrons with S  32 and L2 In an octahedral environment the problem can be projected to one with an effective orbital angular momentum of l1 The combination of the octahedral crystalline electric field and the spin-orbit coupling results in an orbital degeneracy t2g5-eg2 with a ground state described by an effective Jeff   state  as illustrated in Figure 1 Despite the attractive feature that Co2 has a jeff12 groundstate it is not ideal given the presence of electrons in the eg orbitals adding another exchange route between neighboring Co2 sites This constraint occurs through a combination of a Hunds Rules and the fact that the octahedral crystal field splitting characterized by the quantity 10Dq is not large enough for it to be energetically favorable for the electrons to pair up in the tg levels Such a situation does exist for the 4d and 5d transition ion elements making these materials simpler as the eg orbitals can be empty However this problem was recently theoretically evaluated and found that it is possible for Co2 to support the exchange conditions for a Kitaev Hamiltonian 7 Therefore as highlighted in recent theoretical works the study of 3d transition metal ions arranged in a honeycomb lattice such as cobalt is a novel route towards the discovery of new Kitaev systems and constitutes the motivation of our study P M SARTE et al PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100 075143 2019FIG 1 a First four coordination shells

CoO corresponds to the d7 Co2 assuming a high-spinS  32  configuration yielding an orbital triplet with onehole in the t2g orbital manifold The resulting orbital degen-eracy coupled with both a Jahn-Teller driven 3 unit-celldistortion and various far-reaching large exchange interac-tions yields a compl x magnetic excitation spectrum thatresults from the strong entanglement of multiple spin-orbitlevels Fig 1c The resulting multiparameter spin-orbitalHamiltonian incorporating both exchange and spin-orbit cou-pling of similar magnitude further complicated by the com-plex magnetic ordering and structural distortions has madethe understanding of the magnetic excitations in this materialparticularly ifficult 5By employing both the spin-orbit coupling constant  andthe magnetic exchange constants J that were experimentallydetermined in our previous work 545 on the magneticallydiluted monoxide Mg097Co003O we will show that the low-energy magnetic excitation spectrum of CoO measured in theNel regime by inelastic neutron spectroscopy is reproducedby a mean-field multilevel spin-orbit exciton model basedon Greens functions 2 Our parametrization successfullycaptures the fine structure of the well-defined low-energyspin excitations present at the magnetic zone center and alsothe broadening in both momentum and energy at the zoneboundaries In contrast the model fails to reproduce the high-energy response consisting of high-velocity excitations thatdecay with momentum faster than the Co2 form factor Wesuggest that this failure of the model provides evidence for abreakdown of localized spin-orbit excitations at high-energytransfers possibly replaced by delocalized or itinerantlikefluctuations despite CoO being a strong Mott insulatorThis paper is divided into three general sections In the firstsection we describe the theoretical framework that we applyto parametrize the neutron scattering response in CoO Wefirst outline the single-ion response defining the crystal-fieldHamiltonian and then discuss the coupled equations of mo-tion that were used to numerically derive the neutron responseIn the second section we first present the experimental dataas measured with neutron spectroscopy followed by a directcomparison to our multilevel spin-orbit exciton model Toconclude we discuss the high-energy excitations and the pooragreement with the Co2 form factor and speculate as to theiroriginII THEORYWe first discuss the theoretical framework used to describethe localized magnetic response in CoO The neutron mag-netic cross section is proportional to the magnetic dynamicstructure factor SQ defined bySQ  g2L f 2Q  Q Q S Q 1where gL is the Land g factor f Q is the magnetic formfactor 505 and S Q corresponds to the dynamicspin structure factor Since the orbital angular momentum isquenched ie  L  0 for 3d7 Co2 the orbital contributionto the scattering cross section is assumed to be weak andtherefore the spin operators provide the dominant contributionto the neutron scattering cross section 5 This assumptionallows S Q to be defined in terms of expectation valuesof spin operators S i t  of index     or z acting ona site i at a time t

2 in an octahedral crystal field from  Previous characterisation The group at University of Maryland has recently been successful in synthesizing large single crystals of Li2CoP2S6 This material crystallizes in a trigonal space group P-31m with a Curie-Weiss constant of -335K and the Co-Co distances are all identical The crystal structure is shown in Figure 1 with the Cobalt honeycomb layers separated by Li ions Susceptibility measurements Figure 2 find no evidence for long-range magnetic order down to 2 K The combination of lack of any obvious long-range magnetic order and the small Curie-Weiss constant in comparison to the expected value of the spin-orbit coupling make this system a possible candidate for new type of excitations and even maybe a spin-liquid ground state Proposed experiment Experiments in the past on insulating magnetic Co2 based compounds have found strong excitations at low-energies within the jeff12 manifold We therefore proposed to measure the magnetic excitation spectrum at low temperature Given the energy range we want to investigate MACS would be the ideal instrument for this study and we hence request 7 days of beamtime We plan to carry out measurements using Ef  5 meV which would allow us to map out excitations between 0 and 10 meV The 5 g mosaic of single crystals will be aligned so that reflections of the form H0L lie within the horizontal scattering plane The plate geometry combined with the Ef  5 meV configuration will minimize absorption due to the Li allowing penetration depths of 5 mm given the low Li concentration We would like to spend 3 days mapping out the excitations at low temperature and 4 more days to measure the spectrum at higher temperature References  G Jackeli and G Khaliullin Phys Rev Letters 102
