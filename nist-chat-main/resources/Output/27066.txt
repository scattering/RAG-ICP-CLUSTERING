Examining Skyrmion Lattice Transitions and Dynamics with Neutron Tomography Melissa Henderson Benjamin Heacock Dusan Sarenac Dmitry Pushin November 11 2019 Introduction Topologically non trivial spin textures host great promise for future spintronic applications Skyrmions in particular are of burgeoning interest owing to their nanometric size topological protection and high mobility via ultra-low current densities One challenge on the way to practical implementation lies in the lack of experimental observations of room temperature skyrmions Recently Tokunaga et al reported the discovery of an intermetallic room temperature skyrmion  which produced a triangular skyrmion lattice at room temperature ando Zn MnC 8 8 4 undergoes reversible transitions between the conventional triangular lattice and a novel square lattice found at low temperatures  We have synthesized our own polycrystalline skyrmion material of dimensions 34o Zn MnC 8 8 4 mm x 33 mm x 30 mm using a modified Bridgman technique SANS measurements at room temperature with zero field revealed four tilted and smeared magnetic reflections lying atop a ring Such a pattern is characteristic of a ground state helical phase in a multi-domain crystal structure with weak anisotropy Field cooling through the ferromagnetic phase down to 310 K produced a ring indicative of multiple-q domain structures fig1 a Using a method described in  upon rotating the sample in the static magnetic field configuration symmetrically about the vertical axis qy direction the characteristic sixfold symmetric SANS pattern started to emerge fig1 Furthermore a novel secondary scattering ring was present with the same hexagonal symmetry as the primary six-fold pattern but with 12 peaks We then performed a tomography technique outlined in  which consisted of measuring neutron diffraction spectra as a function of sample rotation This data in combination with a phase retrieval algorithm followed by a tomographic reconstruction has been used to generate a scattering length density map of the skyrmion which provides novel insight into the bulk structures and interactions of these skyrmion tubes Based off the three dimensional reconstruction it appears as though the skyrmions form tubes which penetrate the sample to a depth on the micrometer scale fig2 Moreover there appears to be some exotic behavior such as skyrmion tubes splittingforking One possible origin of such behavior could stem from the symmetry breaking rotation sequence driven alignment of the grains and therefore skyrmion lattices An additional SANS experiment was conducted in which we entered the metastable triangular phase through a different thermodynamic pathway via field cooling to 170K Third order diffraction rings emerged and became more pronounced with cooling implying a more ordered and stable skyrmion phase at lower temperatures fig3 Moreover a pinning phenomena wherein the skyrmion lattice does not orient perpendicular to the field was observed in this phase in a later experiment using polarized VSANS There was a discernible difference in the intensity of the peaks for a polarized image taken at the zero position then with the sample rotated independent of the field by 10 degrees It has been repeatedly proposed that a skyrmion forking phenomena in the bulk underlies certain skyrmion destruction mechanisms and current-driven skyrmion de-pinning effects However such forking behaviour has yet to be experimentally realized Coalescing of skyrmions to form line-like structures via hedgehog defect proliferation during creation and destruction processes merging of a moving skyrmion with a pinned skyrmion and current-induced depinning of originally segmented skyrmion strings magnetic monopole-antimonopole pairs could all manifest themselves as this forking phenomena I suggest that there are three possible mechanisms for the forking behavior observed in our bulk tomographic measurements The first lies in the fact that we are in an above room temperature phase and so transverse thermal fluctuations of the skyrmion lines could give rise to merging and subsequent forking of the skyrmions This could be easily determined by tomographically examining the metastable phase that is present at 170 K The second mechanism could fall out from the grain alignment rotation sequence whereby as we move the sample in the field we de-pin these segmented skyrmions monopole-antimonopole defects and as they follow the rotating magnetic field they unwind producing this forking behavior Finally as we perform the rotation sequence and pick up different skyrmion domains they intersect these pinned skyrmions andor segmented skyrmions and they merge ultimately producing the forking behavior Performing the tomography technique before and after the rotation sequence would assist in discerning whether there are pre-existing topological defects which then unbind or with which skyrmion tubes then intersect during the rotation sequence or whether this forking behavior is the result of an incomplete skyrmion formation Moreover it has remained a highly non-trivial issue as to how the conservation of skyrmion charge which gives rise to its topological protection is compatible with lattice form changes and transitions to topologically trivial magnetic states Examining the square to triangular lattice transition could provide novel insight into this problem in addition to skyrmion number conservation skyrmion lattice transitions and therefore skyrmion creationdestruction mechanisms Figure 1

122G and low temperature square phase at 22 K and 400G First second and third order diffraction rings are present Experiment We propose to perform a similar tomographic reconstruction of the skyrmion lattice as outlined in  The tomography technique will be performed both before and after the rotation sequence described in  wherein the sample is rotated independent of the magnetic field which precipitates ordered skyrmion lattices from misaligned structurally disordered grains and during the reversible triangular-square lattice transitions By performing the tomography technique as a function of the sample rotation in the static field sample moving independent of field we would obtain a deeper and more comprehensive picture of how these individual skyrmion lattice domains order and interact and what is the underlying mechanism causing the observed forking pheonema Additionally we would like to perform the tomography technique as a function of temperature to investigate as to whether the increased presence of the higher order diffraction rings is due to ordering and lengthening of the skyrmion tubes and to examine the observed pinning effect We will perform these measurements at a wavelength of in a reciprocal space range of  We require 10 minutes at each one degree6 0058 0 1 increment over a 30 degree angular range totaling 5 hours per tomography scan We
