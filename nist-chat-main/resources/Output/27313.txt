Investigating the structure evolution of the interface layer between solid-state electrolyte and liquid electrolyte through in-operando neutron reflectometry 1 Background and introduction Solid-state electrolytes such as LiPON Garnet NASICON etc have been intensively researched for next-generation batteries Li-S Li-air etc during the past two decades in order to address the safety issues eg short-circuit and thermal runaway of the liquid electrolyte-based lithium ion batteries LIBs Solid-state electrolytes play a role as a medium for Li transport and a barrier for blocking the propagation of lithium dendrites However a poor contact between a solid-state electrolyte and an electrode especially for Li metal results in high interfacial resistances and thus leads to inferior cycle performances and poor electrochemical kinetics To tackle these inherent issues associated with the poor contact of solid-state electrolytes with electrodes several strategies have been attempted One of the representative approaches is to tailor the surface chemistry of solid-state electrolytes from lithiophobic to lithiophilic in order to make an intimate contact between Li and solid-state electrolyte This concept has shown promising results in reducing the interfacial resistance and thus improving the electrochemical performance of solid-state batteries Another strategy is to use a hybrid electrolyte system By using solid-state electrolytes together with liquid electrolytes the most problematic issue associated with the high interfacial resistance caused by the gap between an electrode and a solid-state electrolyte can be easily addressed In addition the shuttling effect of unexpected species derived from redox reactions in Li-S Li-redox-flow and Li-air batteries can be efficiently suppressed by the solid-state electrolyte Due to these benefits the second strategy has been widely adopted in fabricating solid-state-batteries It is recently reported that a solid-liquid electrolyte interphase SLEI layer is formed at the interface of solid-state electrolytes LiPON or Garnet electrolyte when the solid-state electrolyte is contact with the liquid electrolyte However these works have not provided any clear evidence of how the interface layer evolves what it is composed of and how it affects the electrochemical kinetics of solid-state batteries Considering the nanometer thickness of interface layers and the significant role of Li participation in each layer neutron reflectometry NR would be the best method to provide insights into nanometer-scaled structures and phenomena resulted from electrochemical reactions Results of NR measurements would enable us to understand the detailed structure and composition of the formed interface layers and give a substantial guideline to design optimized solid-state electrolytes and to prevent the unexpected side reactions 2Objectives Herein we propose to use in-operando neutron reflectometry NR to study the structure evolution of the formed interface layer between LiPON and liquid electrolyte as a function of cycle and state-of-charge As a modified sample an Al2O3-capped LiPON will be tested with in-operando NR under the same condition to check whether the Al2O3 layer has an effect on suppressing the formation of SLEI layer orand improving the structural integrity of LiPON These results will directly explain the role of the Al2O3 layer and would help to design appropriate solid-state electrolytes for next-generation batteries using hybrid electrolyte system 3 Sample preparation and measurement A 15 nm carbon layer as a current collector and an anode will be deposited onto a SiO2Si wafer followed by the subsequent deposition of a 50-70 nm LiPON onto the deposited carbon layer As a modified sample a 5-10 nm Al2O3 layer will be deposited onto one of the LiPONCarbonSiO2Si samples A schematic of sample designs and measurements is shown in Figure 1 1M Lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide LiTFSI 12-dimethoxyethane DMEdioxolane DIOX will be used as a liquid electrolyte for this study The LiPONCarbon on SiO2Si substrate and the Al2O3-capped LiPONCarbon on SiO2Si substrate as a modified sample will be analyzed together by NR to analyze the intrinsic structure of each layer before and after dipping the prepared samples in the liquid electrolyte After the characterization of intrinsic structure of each layer each cell will be lithiated and delithiated by potentiostat and measured by NR to study if external Li influences the evolution of SLEI layer The feasibility test of preparing LiPON and carbon by magnetron sputtering has been already carried out Figure 1 NR studies with a-d the LiPONCarbonSiO2Si cell and e-h the Al2O3-capped LiPONCarbonSiO2Si cell 4 Expected results and significance Modelling has been carried out using Reflpak resource of NCNR to simulate the SLD profiles of X-ray reflectivity XRR and NR As shown in Figure 2a-b it is hard to discern the layers of each LiPON carbon and SiO2 and Si in XRR due to the poor SLD contrast of each LiPON 1826 x 10-6 A-2 carbon 189650 x 10-6 A-2 SiO2 1883 x 10-6 A-2 and Si 2007 x 10-6 A-2 One the other hand NR has a greater SLD contrast of each LiPON 32520 x 10-6 A-2 carbon 74340 x 10-6 A-2 SiO2 346 x 10-6 A-2 and Si 207 x 10-6 A-2 than XRR The obvious SLD contrast between LiPON and carbon makes NR as the best instrument to gain a clear insight into the structures of carbon LiPON and possible interfacial layers Figure 2 SLD line profile modeling of LiPONCarbonSiO2Si with a XRR and b NR using Reflpak The above-shown profiles clearly show the importance of NR measurement for analyzing the structure of the prepared cells NR Reflectivity has been simulated with the LiPONCarbonSiO2Si cell There is a chance that an interface layer ie SLEI layer will be formed at the surface of LiPON after the sample is dipped into the liquid electrolyte It is likely that the interface layer is composed of lithium oxide lithium carbonate lithium nitride and other lithium-containing species Based upon this assumption these possible byproducts are applied to the reflectivity modeling As shown in Figure 3a-b the reflectivity curve is highly affected by the SLD value of the interface layer And we also confirmed that the thickness and roughness of the interface layer highly influence the reflectivity profile of the prepared sample which is not provided in this proposal due to the page limit which enables efficient data fitting and helps to figure out the precise information of composition and structure of the SLEI layer Figure 3 a Model SLD profiles and b reflectivity curve of LiPONCarbonSiO2Si with SLEI layers having different SLD The thickness of SLEI layer used for the modeling is 2 nm Since the actual composition of the SLEI layer is uncertain arbitrary SLD values were input for the modeling based upon the possible chemical compounds The volume expansion rate of carbon electrode upon lithiationdelithiation is less than 10  which is a much lower than that of Si Sn electrodes around 400  Due to this electrochemical behavior of carbon electrode the cell will undergo less pressure than other cells with high capacity anodes and this will lead to the overall improvement of structural and electrochemical stability of LiPON In addition it is likely the Al2O3 capping layer may act as an artificial SLEI layer for improving the structural integrity of LiPON These results will be confirmed by the SLD profiles of the lithiateddelithiated cell This proposed concept will set the new stage for future studies on thin film solid-state batteries with LiPON electrolyte and open an avenue to design electrodes and solid-state electrolytes for practical solid-state batteries with high cycle stability and durability 5 Specific NR measurements First neutron reflectometry NR measurements will be performed with LiPONCarbonSiO2Si before and after dipping the cell into the liquid electrolyte After the prepared half-cell is lithiated to 001 V potentiostatic hold at 001 V will be carried out while measuring the NR In the same way as lithiation the lithiated cell will be delithiated to 15 V and the potential will be held at 15 V to conduct the NR measurement As the modified sample Al2O3-capped LiPONPtSiO2Si will follow the same measurement procedure as the LiPONCarbonSiO2Si Each cell will be lithiated and delithiated once again after the first cycle to see the change of the SLEI layer as a function of cycle CarbonSiO2Si will be tested as a control sample for determining the intrinsic structure of carbon with higher accuracy The obtained results will be compared with each other to see the influence of the Al2O3 capping layer on the SLEI layer formation The specific plan way of NR measurement can be modified if preliminary offline tests on similar cells shows unexpected results The running time of NR measurements will take 24 hours per measurement Considering the protocol it will require at least 13 days of beam time for this proposed study 6 References  C Wang Y Gong B Liu K Fu Y Yao E Hitz Y Li J Dai S Xu W Luo Nano Lett
