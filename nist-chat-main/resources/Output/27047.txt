Probing the magnetization depth profile in SrRuO3 films to determine the origin of Hall resistivity Magnetic skyrmions have enjoyed much scientific interest since the paper by S Mhlbauer et al  providing the first experimental evidence for the existence of a magnetic skyrmion crystal in MnSi While initial efforts centered around B20 compounds like MnSi after the realization that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which is pivotal to stabilizing topologically protected skyrmions could also be create at interfaces stabilizing skyrmions in thin film heterostructures garnished much attention Beyond a fundamental interest in these chiral spin textures the electric manipulation and potential identification of the presence of skyrmions would be essential to allow the many envisioned applications to be realized Towards this end it was shown that for MnSi in the skyrmion phase there was an additional contribution to the Hall resistance resulting from the topologically quantized Berry phase of the skyrmions named the topological Hall effect THE  The THE resistance was small but distinct and could potentially be used to identify skyrmions in practical applications However in skyrmionic thin films consisting of metallic ferromagnetic metals and alloys it has been challenging to determine a significant THE 3 Interestingly in 2016 J Matsuno et al  claimed that in thin films composed of complex oxides namely ferromagnetic SrRuO3 paramagnetic SrIrO3 superlattices a substantial THE could be observed Typically the THE signal is derived from measurements of the Hall resistivity after subtracting contributions from the ordinary Hall effect OHA linear with the applied field and the anomalous Hall effect AHE proportional to the magnetization Various groups have since measured a similar Hall effect signature in other heterostructures containing SrRuO3 and recently even in single SrRuO3 films 6 As an example Figure 1 shows the total Hall resistivity of single SrRuO3 films taken from Ref  as a function of layer thickness t and temperature It is clear that the Hall resistivity measured as a function of field is not directly proportional to the magnetization that one would expect from of a single homogeneously magnetic film ie does not mimic a typical M-H loop If the AHE resistivity is estimated by being directly proportional to the magnetization and subtracted a residual resistivity is obtained and identified as the THE resistivity as shown in Figure 2 taken from Ref  While several authors identify this residual resistivity as originating from the THE some alternative explanations have also been proposed For example work on CoPd multilayers  has shown that a small difference in the Co thickness could lead to a sign change in the AHE signal and thus for a sample composed of a double multilayer with regions with both thicknesses there were two oppositely signed contributions to the AHE signal which when added result in features in the resistivity similar to those observed for SrRuO3 Furthermore M Ziese et al  determined that a simple superposition of anomalous Hall effect signals from Figure 1 The total Hall resistivity rH of a tetragonal SrRuO3 film of thickness t on STO from Ref  tetragonal- and orthorhombic-like regions within Pr07Ca03MnO3 SrRuO3 superlattices which have opposite signs could result in resistivity curves that look similar to those measured for SrRuO3SrIrO3 superlattices D Kan et al 1 came to a similar explanation for single SrRuO3 films assuming the total resistivity originated from the summation of two AHE resistivities from two types of magnetic domains with different coercivities However neither work was able to experimentally determine the location within the film of the two types of structural or magnetic domains The goal of this proposal is to resolve this debate about the origin of this Hall resistivity and confirm that the measured signals are in fact the superposition of two AHE contributions with opposite signs of the anomalous Hall constant it is clear that two magnetic phases need to be identified For thin films and especially complex oxides the interfaces typically have modified properties due to a range of competing interactions it is very likely that one of the SrRuO3 interfaces has different magnetic properties ie anisotropy and magnetization than the remainder of the layer Since various studies 6 show the resistivity associated with THE is stronger for thinner layers the modified layer is most likely at the interface with the substrate This is why we propose polarized neutron reflectivity PNR experiments on SrRuO3 films as PNR is ideally and uniquely suited to determine the depth dependent properties of a magnetic film With these experiments we aim to identify the presence and location ie depth of a magnetic layer that at the very least has a different anisotropy than the remaining layer The polarized beam reflectometer PBR is most suited for this work Although SrRuO3 predominately has an out-of-plane anisotropy and PNR is insensitive to homogenous out-of-plane magnetization by applying in-plane fields the magnetization will be rotated in plane Regions with different anisotropy will require different field strengths to full saturate in plane and hence it should be possible to identify layers with different anisotropy or even magnetization Experiments will be performed at low temperatures below Tc  150 K for up to 3 magnetic fields and 2 samples with different SrRuO3 thicknesses Based on previous experience with similar samples we expect to require at least 18 hours per reflectivity curve and therefore we request 5 days of beamtime References  S Mhlbauer et al Science 323 915 2009  A Neubauer et al Phys Rev Lett 102
