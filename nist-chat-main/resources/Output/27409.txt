Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta GA 4USDA-ARS Western Regional Research Center Albany CA Scientific importance Although significant research revolves around the structure of cellulose nanofibers and nanocrystals much less research is directed toward chitin the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose and the primary component of crustacean shells and fungal cell walls1 In nature chitin forms sheets of aligned fibers which are embedded in a protein matrix with each sheet then structured into a nanoscale helicoidal stack similar to a twisted plywood geometry2-3 This hierarchical organization is usually referred to as the Bouligand structure as introduced by biologist Yves Bouligand in 19654-5 Bouligand composites exist in the shell of fruits and leaves as the exoskeleton of beetles and anthropods and as part of collagen networks in compact bone6 The structure exhibits a high mechanical strength toughness and self-healing behavior which imparts impact resistance and stability in extreme environments7-8 In addition this complex microstructure creates colors via thin layered or multilayered interference diffraction zero order diffraction and light scattering9-11 In fact the iridescence of jeweled beetles and the shiny blue shell of the African fruit pollia condensate are produced via nanoscale structure rather than from pigmentation12-14 Interestingly cellulose nanocrystals CNCs and chitin nanocrystals enable bottom-up fabrication of Bouligand structures that naturally self-assemble into chiral nematic or cholesteric liquid crystal phase15-19 Understanding how rod-like nanocrystals achieve their chiral hierarchy over multiple length scales in aqueous suspensions is an interesting question for describing plant cell wall structures and could also lead to advanced nanomaterials Structural features of cellulose nanocrystals which are often generally characterized by polarized optical microscopy laser diffraction electron microscopy and to some extent atomic force microscopy were specifically characterized via SANS at NIST by Orts et al in 1998 to investigate enhanced ordering of the cholesteric phase of CNCs induced by magnetic and shear alignment20 Research is needed to extend this result to chitin-derived nanocrystals and their development of Bouligand structures within a confined geometry which is derived via arrangement within a microgel Like CNCs chitin nanocrystals are isolated through acid hydrolysis and can form a twisted chiral nematic configuration in solution as revealed by Revol and Marchessault15 The pitch of the cholesteric phase of chitin is much larger than that of CNCs enabling us to observe the twisting behavior optically as outlined in Figure 1 Recently our group embedded the chiral nematic phase of chitin nanocrystals in a polymer microgel using an inverse emulsion polymerization technique coupled with microfluidic structuring PNIPAM polyN-isopropylacrylamide a thermoresponsive material possessing a lower critical solution temperature LCST was used to form entrapped microgels The twisted structure of chitin nanocrystals are preserved within polymer spheres see the first figure which interestingly form bipolar structures -- prolate spheroids rather than spherical shape Also they are thermoresponsive which means we can change the pitch of helix upon microgel volume phase transitions They exhibit swelling-deswelling behavior upon temperature change along the axis of helix which appears to contradict the previous SANS results for CNCs that microfibrils pack tighter along the cholesteric axis than perpendicular to it It is apparent that more data of chitin organization on the length scale between a single particle and that of the interparticle spacing in the liquid crystal state is crucial to understand the self-assembly of this tunable cholesteric structure In this work we seek to understand the aggregation behavior of liquid crystalline phase of chitin nanocrystals and its relationship with helical twist specifically as a function of temperature The mechanism of dynamics of pitch compression and relaxation is still unclear Arguably SAXS could be applied to characterize this system however interpretation of SAX data would be complicated by its multiple polymeric materials and would provide much less information than SANS SANS is also required because it is non-destructive and we can characterize the change in pitch-compression with temperature in situ without risk of x-rays degrading the polymer during measurement of this complex multi-phase system21 It is well known that when a cholesteric fluid between flat plates is dilated the fluid creates an instability Since the cholesteric phase are captured and solidified in a polymer matrix with well-aligned structure we can investigate changes in the hierarchical structure more precisely By exploiting the present methods we expect to improve the understanding of the different but intriguing self-assembling systems of Bouligand structures which are found in nature and could be used to create advanced biomimetic structures Experimental Plan For proof of principle PNIPAMchitin nanocrystals microgels with various radius will be prepared and dispersed in D2O Based on our preliminary results microgel with a diameter less than 70  usually have one periodic band and shows spherical shape Microgels with two periodic bands start to elongate along the axis of helix Addition of chitin nanocrystals pH  4 shifted phase transition temperature of microgels to 29 C and they are fully collapsed after 33 C SANS measurements will be performed at various temperature to study twisted structure and aggregation of chitin nanocrystals References 1
