 The Influence of Outer Leaflet Lipids on Interleaflet Coupling in Asymmetric Membranes Scientific Importance The mammalian plasma membrane PM is composed of a chemically diverse set of lipids and associated proteins It has long been established that the numerous PM lipids are not randomly arranged but instead are asymmetrically distributed between the two bilayer leaflets1 Specifically sphingomyelin SM and phosphatidylcholine PC lipids are enriched in the extracellular leaflet while the amino-containing lipids phosphatidylserine PS and phosphatidylethanolamine PE along with phosphatidylinositol PI are primarily located in the cytoplasmic leaflet1-4 In addition to this headgroup asymmetry a marked asymmetry also exists within the acyl chain region The outer leaflet is enriched in lipids possessing chains that are either fully saturated or that contain a trans double bond such as the sphingosine moiety of sphingolipids and the inner leaflet is enriched in phospholipids that possess one or more cis unsaturations in their sn-2 chains In general saturated lipids undergo their main chain melting transition TM at higher temperatures than unsaturated lipids56 For example at physiological temperatures pure SM bilayers form a gel phase distinguished by high lipid translational and chain conformational order whereas unsaturated glycerophospholipids form a fluid phase distinguished by a lack of long-range translational order and a low degree of chain conformational order7-9 Despite the importance of PM asymmetry for normal cell function little is known about how the two leaflets of an asymmetric bilayer influence each others properties Mean field theoretical treatments predict that interleaflet coupling can alter the properties of both leaflets reducing order in the leaflet containing high-melting lipids while increasing order in the leaflet containing low-melting lipids10-12 This prediction is supported by limited experimental evidence13-15 but the factors that control the coupling strength are poorly understood Here we aim to investigate interleaflet coupling at the molecular level by studying how different types of high-melting lipids alter the properties of a leaflet enriched in low-melting lipids SANS is a unique tool for studying membranes due to the large range of NSLD contrasts achievable by varying the 1H2H ratios of both solvent and lipid Scattering from individual leaflets of an asymmetric bilayer can be highlighted through contrast variation allowing for robust determination of asymmetric bilayer structure and spatial organization Previous Experiments and Results We recently developed a robust method for preparing asymmetric large unilamellar vesicles aLUVs using cyclodextrin-mediated lipid exchange enabling a range of biophysical studies including SANS to determine bilayer structure with sub-nanometer resolution15 Isotopically asymmetric POPC vesicles were found to have the same bilayer thickness and area per lipid as symmetric POPC vesicles demonstrating that the preparation protocol preserved native bilayer structure Partial exchange of DPPC into the outer leaflet of POPC vesicles outer leaflet composition 3466 mol DPPCPOPC produced chemically asymmetric vesicles with a gelfluid phase-separated outer leaflet and a uniform POPC-rich inner leaflet The thicknesses and areas per lipid of coexisting domains was determined through an analysis of SANS data and revealed reduced lipid packing density of the outer leaflet DPPC-rich phase compared to typical gel phases Our finding that a disordered inner leaflet can partially fluidize ordered outer leaflet domains indicates some Figure 1 Structure of chemically asymmetric DPPCPOPC aLUVs at 20oC determined by SANS Best-fit NSLD profiles for a two-phase model with recovered structural parameters Figure reproduced from Ref 15 degree of interleaflet coupling Fig 1 and motivates additional studies to further understand the molecular basis of interleaflet coupling Proposed Experiment We propose to use SANS to determine the structure of asymmetric bilayers with a fluid inner leaflet and an ordered outer leaflet enriched in saturated lipids of varying chain length Asymmetric 100 nm diameter vesicles suspended in 100 D2O will be prepared by exchanging either DMPCd54 DPPCd62 or DSPCd70 into the outer leaflet of vesicles composed of di141 di161 di181 or di201 Because of the large interleaflet NSLD contrast these samples are readily amenable to SANS analysis to separately determine structural properties of each leaflet including area per lipid and leaflet thickness A comparison of these values to those obtained for identical compositions in symmetric liposomes will inform on the strength of interleaflet coupling 12 asymmetric compositions and their 24 symmetric counterparts ie the compositions of the inner or outer leaflets will each be measured at two temperatures that include temperatures above and below the melting transition of the outer leaflet lipid DMPCd54 TM  20C DPPC-d62 TM  39C and DSPCd70 TM  52C Small-angle X-ray scattering data for the same samples and temperatures will be collected with ORNLs BioSAXS instrument The SANS and SAXS curves will be jointly analyzed using a matter density-based strip model for the transverse neutron scattering length density profiles from which leaflet structural properties will be extracted15-17 Complementary differential scanning calorimetry data on the same samples will provide an independent determination of the phase behavior of the asymmetric samples17 and thus provide constraints for modeling the SANS data Asymmetric giant unilamellar vesicles of the same compositions will be prepared and imaged with confocal fluorescence microscopy Allowing  1 hr of data collection for each of the 72 conditions described above we request three days of beam time on the NGB-30-meter SANS instrument which allows acquisition of the necessary q-range  0001-05 -1 in a single instrument configuration using the standard SANS configuration neutron wavelength of 60  and SDD of 1m 4 m and 13 m combined with the lens configuration wavelength of 84  and SDD of 13 m There are no special safety considerations all materials are non-toxic Publications and Impact Our group has made significant contributions to the use of scattering techniques for determining the structure of asymmetric lipid membranes15-19 The proposed experiments will provide further insight into mechanisms of interleaflet coupling References 1 Bretscher M 1972 Nature 23611 2
