Probing disorder effects on quantum spin fluctuations in a spin-12 triangular lattice antiferromagnet Introduction The main venue for the search of quantum spin liquids QSLs in two and higher dimensions is highly frustrated quantum magnets  The localized moments of these materials are subject to exchange interactions which cannot be simultaneously optimized While identifying a genuine QSL in a real material should await further investigations the extensive search made thus far has reported many instances of magnetically ordered materials with anomalous spin dynamics A conceivable working hypothesis is that these materials are not far from the quantum melting point QMP that signals the transition into a QSL phase The proximity to a QMP implies a potentially strong influence of the nearby QSL phases on the magnetic excitation spectrum Our recent inelastic neutron scattering INS studies on a spin-12 triangular lattice antiferromagnet Ba3CoSb2O9 confirm its proximity to a QMP 2  This system orders below 38 K with a 120 degree spin structure However its spin dynamics still retains various anomalous features The high frequency excitation continuum has a large spectral weight almost comparable to that of the single-magnon excitations Furthermore magnon spectral lines are broadened throughout the entire Brillouin zone Fig 1 Neither feature can be explained by conventional spin wave theory  Meanwhile recently we performed INS of Ba3CoSb2O9 on MACS at 105 T The obtained spin dynamics Fig 1 in the so-called up-up-down UUD phase with 13 of the saturated magnetization can be well fit with a XXZ model  Spin-wave simulations in that phase are more accurate than in zero-field due to the gapped nature of the spectrum in spite of the gap being a pure quantum effect This fact further confirms that the anomalies we observed at zero field have an intrinsic quantum origin Meanwhile more studies on quantum magnets show that the disorder in the sample even on non-magnetic site will affect the quantum spin fluctuations of the system One proposal is that disorder maybe an important ingredient for QSL  For example the recently studied QSL MgYbGaO4 has MgGa disorder on the nonmagnetic site Yb-magnetic triangular site is untouched and it may play an important role for its exotic ground-state  With this in mind here we are motived to study how disorder affects the quantum spin fluctuations in Ba3CoSb2O9 This kind of study should help us to better understand the exotic magnetism while a system approaches a QMP Preliminary results To probe the effect of disorder on nonmagnetic site We recently have successfully grown a high-quality single crystal of Ba3CoSb18Nb02O9 DC susceptibility see Fig 2a inset shows no long-range magnetic ordering above 2K Specific heat measured at zero field see Fig 2a clearly shows a peak at 12 K indicating an antiferromagnetic ordering AC susceptibility measured at 002 K see Fig 2b shows an anomaly at 75 T representing the lower critical field Hc1 of the UUD phase Meanwhile AC susceptibility shows no sign for the second anomaly the upper boundary for the UUD phase at least up to 18 T This fact suggests the field extent for UUD phase of of Ba3CoSb18Nb02O9 is larger than 10 T compared to that of Ba3CoSb2O9 5 T One possible scenario is that the nonmagnetic site disorder enhances quantum fluctuations which calls for the further investigation The elastic neutron scattering measurements will be done at HFIR ONRL to figure out the magnetic structure of this Nb doping material Proposed Research We have synthesized a high-quality 1g single crystal sample The sample will be aligned in HH scattering plane As the first step of the research we propose to map out the magnetic excitations over the whole BZ under zero field The data will be collected at the base temperature 03 K by making 120 of sample rotations with 2 step size to cover the interested reciprocal space with the energy transfer range 0-4 meV We estimate 4-day beam time will be enough for this study References  C Lacroix et al Introduction to Frustrated Magnetism Materials Experiments Theory Springer- Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011   J Ma et
