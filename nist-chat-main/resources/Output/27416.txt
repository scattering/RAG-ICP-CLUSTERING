 Page 1 of 3 Statement of Research Scientific Importance Magnetic pyrochlore systems which consist of a network of corner sharing tetrahedra have been at the forefront of research on frustrated magnets The nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction between the spins on a pyrochlore lattice cannot select a unique ordered state and thus results in a large ground state degeneracy Consequently quantum fluctuations are enhanced in these quantum spin systems Recently a new sub-class of materials called the breathing pyrochlores BP have attracted attention These systems provide an ideal platform for understanding the anisotropic exchange models described Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 BYZO has been reported to be a geometrically frustrated BP which has been successfully synthesized in polycrystalline form Contrary to the regular pyrochlore lattice BYZO BP lattice consists of two alternating main tetrahedra expanded and contracted  Very recently we successfully synthesized another system in the BP family with Tm3 Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 BTmZO BTmZO has the same average structure as BYZO and rr ratio is very similar in both compounds Here we propose to investigate the breathing pyrochlore Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 BTmZO In the BYZO system the Yb3 4f13 ion effectively has a pseuodo-spin  Kramers doublet ground state separated by CEF splitting energy of 38 meV  Despite the Curie-Weiss temperature of -67 K indicating considerable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction no long-range order has been reported down to sub-Kelvin temperatures 1- First investigations of this material have revealed interesting features Magnetization data shows step like features at 35 T and 88 T as shown in Fig 2b  The plateaus between these features correspond to the AFM-coupled tetrahedron with Seff  0 in zero field transitioning to the Seff  1 and 2 spin states with increasing applied field The steps correspond to a singlet-triplet and triplet-quintet crossings respectively The heat capacity measurements at low temperature demonstrate that a unique ground state is selected from the doublet ground state of the single-tetrahedral model  To this date the BP ground state of the BYZO is still an open question where a nontrivial quantum state and various scenarios are proposed to be considered as perturbation terms in the Hamiltonian 1 interaction between spin tetrahedral 2 partial ordering of dimers 3 a chiral ordered phase induced at lower temperatures by combination of inter-tetrahedra interactions and a large DM interaction 4 spin-lattice coupling and the role of the Jahn-Teller interactions Our newly synthesized breathing pyrochlore system Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 BTmZO will provide more insight to the understanding of the BP systems Preliminary Work Motivated by the reported results we have successfully synthesized high quality single crystal samples of BYZO and BTmZO using the travelling solvent floating zone technique We performed single crystal inelastic neutron scattering experiments on BYZO single crystal sample using the disc chopper spectrometer DCS at NIST CNCS at SNS and WAND2 diffractometer at HFIR  We have identified the crystal filed excitation levels using our single crystal sample which agrees with previously observed levels with powder samples Our study shows interesting Q dependence of magnetic form factors and anisotropic response to applied magnetic field To investigate the magnetic ordering in these systems we carried out zero field ZF SR measurements on polycrystalline samples of BYZO and BTmZO in a Quantum Continuous Flow Cryostat on the GPS spectrometer at the Swiss Muon Source PSI Switzerland and previously measured single crystalline BYZO at ISIS We observed no oscillations and thus no long-range ordered state down to 16 K in this materials at PSI nor down to 60 mK in BYZO at ISIS As shown in figure 2 the behavior of the two compounds measured appears to be similar they both show significant relaxation of a mixed static and dynamic character with a peak in the dynamic relaxation rate around 40-60 K which is indicative of a critical slowing down of the moments and hence a potential phase transition in this temperature range The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements Figure 1 a Breathing Pyrochlore crystal structure of Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 BYZO and Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 BTmZO b Magnetization of BYZO with steps at 35 T and 88 T between the spin states of Seff  012  Page 2 of 3 were performed on BYZO single crystal and BTmZO powder samples Magnetic measurements of BTmZO single crystal samples are currently in progress An anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility data is observed around 50 K and 40 K for BYZO not shown and BTmZO shown in the inset of fig 3a respectively and which is agreeing with our SR study In figure 3 we have shown the measured magnetic data on BTmZO powder sample from 300 mK to 300 K in presence of 001 T applied magnetic field  In figure 2a both the ZFC and FC data show similar behavior down to 600 mK In the contrary to the BYZO magnetic data we have observed the ZFC-FC splitting below 600 mK Interestingly in presence of higher magnetic field 02 T the splitting has reduced as shown in figure 3 b To understand further we have performed the isothermal magnetization data above and below this transition 600 mK and the data are shown in the inset of figure 3 c Although at higher magnetic field H  7 T the value of magnetization is almost same but at lower field the behavior seems not similar at different temperatures as shown in figure 3 c Very recently we performed inelastic neutron scattering experiment on powder sample of BTmZO CEF levels were found to be at 93 meV and 152 meV which are different from CEF levels observed for Yb-based breathing pyrochlore system BYZO We also measured the low energy excitations at DCS and found very low energy excitations emerging from high symmetry points at low Q Figure 4 shows the field dependence of low energy excitations up to 9 T However the details of the evolution of the excitations are not clear from the powder measurements Therefore we propose to study the low energy excitation of the BTmZO BP system using newly synthesized single crystal sample and understand the detailed Q dependence and any dispersion associated in these excitations Figure 3 a Inverse magnetic susceptibility of BYZO

3 of 3 Choice of Instrument DCS is the most suitable instrument for this study We will use 5  as the wavelength and will measure with low resolution 01 meV energy resolution Once the details of the excitations are identified we may use medium resolution as necessary in a focused region in Q space for higher resolution measurements for finer details We will use 10 T or 11 T magnet to study the evolution of the excitations under magnetic field Experiment Plan and Data Analysis Here we propose to continue these low energy excitation studies of BTmZO system using single crystal samples at DCS We will spend most of the experiment time at base temperature and will need dilution refrigerator to study the system below the transition temperature 06 K We will align the crystal in a scattering plane perpendicular to 111 direction and magnetic field will be applied along 111 direction We will measure at several magnetic fields 0 T 2T 4 T and 9 T at base temperature We will also measure at few high temperatures at 0 T at above and below  40 K to understand the nature of the anomaly observed in susceptibility measurements In order to set-up and calibrate and measure at several different magnetic field and temperatures we estimate we will need approximately 7 days of beam time References 1 K Kimura S Nakatsuji T Kimura Experimental realization of a quantum breathing pyrochlore
