Magnetic excitations in the highly frustrated fcc iridate K2IrCl6 Magnetic materials with high degree of frustration either due to lattice geometry or competing anisotropic interactions have the potential to host exotic magnetic ground states  Experimental efforts are driven by the goal of uncovering magnetic ground states governed by large magnetic fluctuations However in a real material additional exchange terms and small perturbations often stabilize long-range magnetic order 2 Understanding these ordered phases of matter in spin liquid candidate materials determining their magnetic structure studying their collective magnetic modes and exploring the effects of external perturbations in an attempt to reconstruct the magnetic Hamiltonian can help in the search of quantum liquids beyond one dimension K2IrCl6 is an exciting compound in which to explore Heisenberg-Kitaev exchange physics in a cubic lattice  The combination of crystal field and spin orbit renders a half filled band of Jeff  12 character which is localized by electron-electron interactions Susceptibility measurements revealed a magnetic transition at TN  305 K with a Curie-Weiss temperature CW  - 426 K  Single crystal neutron diffraction measurements revealed this transition corresponds to the onset of collinear long range antiferromagnetic order with propagation vector k  1012 5 The crystalline structure remains cubic to at least 17 K with the Ir atoms surrounded by undistorted corner sharing chlorine octahedra Together this indicates strong magnetic frustration in K2IrCl6 f  137 as is expected on the fcc lattice when further neighbor exchange terms are non-negligible Moreover thermodynamic measurements show that the magnetic ordering temperature TN  74 K 305 K 185 K and 05 K and Curie temperature are extremely sensitive to the size of the alkali ligand within members of the A2IrCl6 family A  Na K Rb Cs respectively  This suggests a magnetic ground state that could be easily controlled by external perturbations for example hydrostatic pressure However to date there are no measurements of magnetic excitations in this compound This is essential to define the sign of the Kitaev interactions and thus where they lie on the J-K-G phase diagram with sights on future experiments under hydrostatic pressure  Inelastic neutron scattering is the only experimental technique able to resolve spin waves in these hexachloride iridates We propose here a single crystal inelastic neutron scattering measurement on the highly frustrated fcc iridate K2IrCl6 to study Heisenberg-Kitaev physics We have recently succeeded in growing single crystals of K2IrCl6 with each growth trial giving a yield of around 300mg of crystals of 1x1x1mm size We note that one absorption length for 5 meV neutrons in these Ir samples is 14 mm so our single crystals are already of optimal size for this experiment We will prepare an array of crystals with total dimensions 2 mm x 2mm x 5 cm to achieve a total mass of Figure 1 Temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and inverse magnetic susceptibility in K2IrCl6 Figure 2 Single crystals of K2IrCl6 grown in the Plumb lab at Brown University 15 g and fill the entire height of the focused neutron beam while limiting the thickness of the sample to one absorption length for all sample angles Each crystal is well faceted and easily co-aligned The single crystals will be co-aligned in the HHL scattering plane and we will operate MACS with a fixed final energy of 5 meV in double focusing mode This configuration provides the optimal combination of neutron flux and energy resolution 03 meV required to map the expected 4 meV bandwidth CW  - 426 K of magnetic excitations in K2IrCl6 Measurements will be performed in a standard orange cryostat and we will concentrate on obtaining high quality data below the 305 K Neel temperature Owing to the small moment eff  173 B rapidly decaying form-factor of Ir4  and large absorption cross-section we are anticipating that long counting times will be necessary to obtain a high statistics data set While the experiment will be challenging the measurement of magnetic excitations in this highly absorbing compound is readily achievable Magnetic excitations have been measured successfully in even more highly absorbing samples on MACS For instance heavily damped spin waves were clearly resolved in CeRhIn5  which has a linear neutron attenuation factor from absorption of 15 cm-1 This is more than twice the attenuation factor in K2IrCl6 645 cm-1 and both compounds are expected to have comparable magnetic spectral density as given by the total moment over the magnetic bandwidth  B2meV Thus we have a high degree of confidence that our proposed experiments will succeed Based on our previous experience with highly absorbing samples significant counting times will be required Including sufficient time for background measurements we are requesting a total of six days of beam time on MACS The measured magnetic excitations will be modeled with linear and non-linear spin wave theory to characterize the exchange terms necessary to explain the magnetic ground state of K2IrCl6 This experiment not only will measure for the first time the magnetic excitations in an fcc iridate it will also uniquely determine the position of this compound in the J-K-G phase space These results will serve as a reference for future experiments under external perturbations attempting to fully suppress the magnetic order References  L Balents Nature 464 199 2010  R D Johnson et al Phys Rev B 92 235119 2015  R Coldea et al Phys Rev B 68 134424 2003  N Khan et al Phys Rev B 99 144425 2019  M T Hutchings and C G Windsor Proc Phys Soc 91 928 1967  J W Lynn et al Phys Rev Lett 37 154 1976  Griffiths J H E et al Proc R Soc Lond A 250 1959  S M Winter et al J Phys Condens Matter 29 493002 2017  C Stock et al Phys Rev Lett 114 247005 2015
