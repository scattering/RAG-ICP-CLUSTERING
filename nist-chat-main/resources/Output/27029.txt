27029 - The ageing of interpenetrating polymer networks IPN for medicaldevicesBackground and significanceHydrogels would be ideal materials for biomedicalapplications to help overcome serious problems such ashealthcare-associated infections  but their poormechanical properties prohibit their use  Interpenetratingpolymer networks IPNs of hydrophilic hydrogel overcomethese issues and are being actively developed as materialsfor use as medical devices The Danish life science companyBiomodics which specialises in the synthesis of IPNs insupercritical carbon dioxide sc-CO2 has demonstrateddevices with significant improvements to ones currently onthe market Their devices reduce formation of the biofilms that can result in hospital acquiredinfections and can also serve as an innovative drug delivery solution  The system-spanningstructure of the hydrogel is crucial and understanding the IPN structure which small-angle scatteringis well-suited to do will help Biomodics target desired properties for specific applicationsUnfortunately determining the structure of the hydrogels in these IPNs is challenging as they containsilica filler particles for mechanical purposes that dominate small-angle scattering measurementsunless the contrast is carefully considered The X-ray and neutron scattering length densities of allparts of the system are shown in Table 1 Experiments conducted at the KWS-2 instrument at FRM-II in Munich have shown that the IPN structure can be studied by submerging the samples in D2O tohighlight the hydrogel structure This in combination with spin-echo SANS measurements performedat Reactor Institute Delft and AFM measurements performed at University of Copenhagen havegiven us a good understanding of the IPNs as a a continuous two-phase material with structuralinhomogeneities from the nanometer to the micrometer scaleThese devices will be inserted into patients bodies and the intention is for them to remain there for alifetime Studying the IPNs immersed in different physiologically-realistic buffers as a function ofexposure time will make it possible to understand how the conditions when inserted in the body foran extended time impact the structure of the materials The goal is to predict how the material willbehave over their lifetime Biomodics are currently performing trials of IPN devices in animal studiesand this concurrent study of ageing and material structure will enable us to compare the nanoscalematerial structure to the medical function and mechanical properties measured when the devices areextracted from the animals Preliminary workThe structure of the IPN has proven challenging to determine experimentally Electron microscopySEM shows that the presence of the hydrogel impacts the morphology of the silicone  but canonly see m-scale structure and cannot differentiate between the two components Confocalfluorescence microscopy showed that on the length scale studied the materials are homogenousSmall-angle X-ray scattering was dominated by the scattering from filler particles which madestudying the polymer impossiblePrevious work using neutronsRather than using these structural characterisation techniques we have been able to use neutronscattering to elucidate the structure To gain contrast the IPNs were soaked in D2O and the structurewas studied using SANS MLZ and spin-echo SANS TU Delft This first achievement clearlyshowed that neutrons are essential to study the IPN structure as the difference between H and DTable 1 X-ray and neutron scattering lengthdensities for all

andhydrogelThe IPNs were found to have a two-phase phase-separated structure withscattering that could be modelled with asingle correlation length data shown inFigure 1 The correlation length of 300  iseasily accessible by conventional SANSAt longer length scales the materials werefound to be phase separated as wellpresumably into hydrogel-rich and hydrogel-poor regions This was determined usingspin-echo SANS measurements data notshown which was used to study structuresof a size up to 15 m The larger phase-separated regions were modelled asspheres with diameters on order of 1 mVSANS measurements at NIST will overlapthe length scale studied by spin-echo SANSalthough the motivation for using thisinstrument is to study lower Q than waspossible using the KWS-2 instrument at FRM-IIDetailed description of experimentSamplesTo study how these IPNs may change in time in different media we have devised an ageingexperiment to study the structure as a function of several variables all with appropriate controls asoutlined below These will be produced in a single grade of silicone using a single combination ofhydrogel monomers albeit at different concentrations Ageing times 4 Freshly prepared one month two months and four months ageing Hydrogel concentrations 5 0 silicone as provided 0 silicone pre-swollen in sc-CO220 35 and 50 Submersion media 3 Pure D2O simulated body fluid in D2O and dilute solution 1hydrogen peroxide I D2O accelerated ageing mediumThis will give a total of 63 measurements 60 samples outlined above and 3 submersion mediabackgrounds This will enable us to determine the effect of time of exposure whether swelling thesilicone or expanding it with hydrogel impacts the structure and whether the electrolytes in the bodypresent in simulated body fluid and not D2O impact the structure The samples with the longestexposure will be measured first If the structure of any one sample composition is not affected by themaximum ageing the intermediately aged samples in that series will not be measured We expectthis to be the case for some samples and this will reduce the total number of samplesPrevious measurements at MLZs KWS-2 beamline of IPN samples and 4 instrument configurationscovering a Q-range of 0001-05 -1 revealed that a total exposure time of 90 min per sample issufficient for good statistics We anticipate a similar exposure time for the single shot to cover theentire Q-range on VSANS Figure 1 Previous SANS data on D2O-hydrated samples of IPN Sqr is the grade of silicone the number in the label is the wt  of hydrogel and the PHEMA wt  refers to all hydrogel monomers Qualitatively the curves are similar although the correlation length bottom right does vary slightly with concentrationWe anticipate running a total of 60 samples and with a measurement time per sample of 90 minutesthis gives a total measurement time of around 375 days and will leave 025 day for instrument setuptransmission measurements for initial tests of sample holders discussed below and samplechanges Our beamtime request is therefore 4 daysScattering measurementsTo cover a similar Q-range to our previous SANS and spin-echo SANS measurements we requestbeamtime on the VSANS instrument For the proposed experiments we want to cover a combined Q-range of ca 00006-05  -1 We wouldlike to use the standard resolution of   13 of the instrument using the velocity selector Toaccess this Q-range we need to use the collimation with the focusing MgF2 lenses converging narrowbeams Since our samples will be produced as thin sheets with sizes of ca 18 mm x 60 mm x 08mm we could use a good portion of the maximal illuminated sample area Furthermore we need touse all three detectors including the high-resolution one to cover the requested Q-rangeFrom the previous beamtime at MLZ we learned that the samples produce multiple scattering at longneutron wavelengths Thus we need to use a setup with a sufficiently small wavelength the standard67  for the lens option from the velocity selector to minimize the multiple scattering and to ensurethat the SANS patterns acquired from the 3 detectors overlap Even with such a low wavelength wecan still access at VSANS the requested Qmin of 00006 -1We intend to measure the samples at ambient temperatures in their submersion media and to mountthem in the demountable titanium cells 2 mm thickness available at NIST and to use the 9 positionsample changer at ambient temperature The samples are strongly scattering and the illuminatedarea on these cells should provide sufficient scattering intensity for measurements to be performed ina reasonable time If the sample needs to be illuminated on a larger area we request the possibility ofusing the larger neutron spin echo cells 40 mm diameter without the use of a sample changer orthe VSANS 12-beam-cellsReason for choice of requested instrumentVSANS provides a bright and broad Q range instrument It will enable us to measure scattering datarelating to the SANS-accessible structures in these materials and provide us at the same time a goodoverlap to SESANS data which we intend to measure in another beamtime for selected samplesVSANSs capability to measure a wide Q-range in one go by simultaneously acquiring the data with 3detectors allows us to keep the exposure times reasonably shortReferences Ramstedt M et
