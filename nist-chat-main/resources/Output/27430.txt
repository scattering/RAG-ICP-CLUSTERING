 Page 1 of 2 A longitudinal magnon Higgs mode in 2D square-lattice antiferromagnet Ba2FeSi2O7 For a system of interacting spins amplitude fluctuations of the local order parameter so-called longitudinal magnon Higgs mode can exist as well-defined collective excitations near a quantum critical point QCP and searching for the novel excitation mode has attracted much attention in condensed matter physics  Here we consider two phases of long-range-ordered state generated by the interplay of inter-site exchange interaction J and the gapped paramagnetic state driven by strong single ion anisotropy D for integer spin S12 arising from a large crystal distortion and spin-orbit coupling at single-site 6 Hence the strong competition between J and D can drive the system towards a QCP and the Higgs mode excitation emerges on the verge of the QCP on the side of long-range-ordered phase 2 A recent theoretical study of the square lattice multiferroic magnet A2MSi2O7 ASr Ba Mtransition metal predicts that the system of integer spin S1 or 2 with a large easy-plane anisotropy provides a good playground to search for novel excitation modes  In this proposal we introduces a new compound with Fe-based square lattice magnet Ba2FeSi2O7 3d6 S2 and suggest the possible longitudinal magnon Higgs mode in its spin excitation Ba2FeSi2O7 BFSO consists of a two-dimensional square lattice spin network FeO4 tetrahedra in ab-plane are connected through SiO4 polyhedra forming a square spin-lattice as shown in Fig1 a Noticeably the tetragonal distortion of FeO4 tetrahedra is of 26  compression with respect to a perfect tetrahedron from XRD and neutron diffraction refinement result which induces strong single-ion anisotropy in the Fe2 spins  On the other hand Fe2 spins are weakly coupled through super-super exchange Fe2-O2--O2--Fe2 interactions Thus the combination of a strong single ion anisotropy and weakly connected spins should result in the picture outlined above even if it stabilizes magnetic order as a ground state The magnetization curves displayed in Fig a and b are explained as well in the context of the antiferromagnetic order with the strong single-ionic anisotropy The magnetic susceptibility curves M vs T in a temperature range of 18 K  T 300 K and the magnetization curve M vs H in a field range of 0 T  H  30 T show strong easy-plane anisotropy of spins At low temperature the first derivative of magnetic susceptibility shows an anomaly at TN49 K indicating the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature This relatively low ordering temperature without geometrical spin frustration refers to weakly coupled Heisenberg exchange interaction with respect to S2 Also a rough estimation for the exchange coupling constant J is made by fitting Curie-Weiss formula to the susceptibility curve in the range of 50 K T 300 K which gives a value of J -0095 meV 565J-265 K z4 for nearest neighbor This value is slightly lower than the exchange values of its sister compounds for example 556502 meV with 57 56510 meV in Ba2CoGe2O7  Considering not only larger tetrahedral compression in Fe-compound than Co compound 13 but also large magnetic anisotropy from magnetization data 55N5O55P5G10 K595R  25  55N5O55P5G10 K565  we can expect that Fe compound has significant D-term Then the smaller value of J and the enhanced D push the Fe-compound closer to the QCP than other candidates in the phase diagram as a function of JD proposed by Matsumoto  Fig1c shows our neutron diffraction results using BT-1 NCNR The magnetic Bragg reflections are indexed with propagation vector k101 and the intensities of the magnetic peaks are described with the antiferromagnetic collinear spin arrangement along 11 as seen in Fig1b It should be noted that the ordered magnetic moment of Fe2 ions is 292 B This is only 73 of Fe full moments of S2 with g2 The significant Figure 1 a Crystallography of Ba2FeSi2O7 FeO4 tetrahedra constructs 2D squared lattice in

concomitant spin fluctuations Subsequently BFSO is expected to provide excellent platform to explore the novel Higgs mode but also quantum criticality Figure 2 a T-dependent magnetic susceptibility of

spectrometer for studying low energy excitations Considering the aforementioned Heisenberg exchange interaction J01 meV along with the square lattice geometry the energy of magnon branches are expected to be less than 12 meV MACS has the right combination of resolution and the proper energy coverage so that the spin wave dispersion can be fully mapped in Ba2FeSi2O7 We have a 500 mg of Ba2FeSi2O7 single crystal grown by the floating zone method and plan to prepare a total 3 g samples for co-alignment As the first step for this project the overall investigation of the zero field magnon dispersion of Ba2FeSi2O7 using unpolarized neutrons We plan to measure covering 120 degrees of azimuthal angle with 2 degree step per 20 seconds at three temperatures 18 K 5 K and 10 K and sole background measurement with empty can The temperature dependence enables to study how the longitudinal spin waves evolve with temperature Then we request 6 days in total for measurement including cooling instruments and sample replacement time For data reduction and analysis DAVE software will be used  References  D Pekker and C M Varma Annu Rev Condens Matter Phys 6 269 2015  B Lake et al PRB
