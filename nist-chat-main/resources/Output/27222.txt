Spin dynamics in Nd3Ga5O12 The study of the magnetic properties of rare-earth ion systems continues to attract much attention as it is at the heart of the physics of frustrated magnets and has led to ground-breaking concepts such as Coulomb phases physics or emergent quantum electrodynamics in quantum spin ice 1 2  Beside the pyrochlore structure formed by corner sharing tetrahedra the hyperkagom structure made of corner sharing triangles is also prone to geometric frustration Whether or not the concepts developed in the context of pyrochlores might be adapted to this structure represents an important issue In gallium garnets RGG ie RGa5O12 compounds with R  rare-earth - space group Ia-3d rare-earth ions occupy the vertices of triangles organized in two nested subnetworks forming such a hyperkagom structure Figure 1 The unusual symmetry of the crystal field produces different local anisotropy axes at different sites As a result magnetic moments are aligned along the cubic axes which point in orthogonal directions giving as for pyrochlores a magnetic multi-axis system For most RGGs  long-range magnetic ordering is observed at subkelvin temperatures the magnetic order follows the magnetic space group Ia-3d illustrated on Figure 2 with six magnetic sublattices corresponding to the ordering of moment along x y or z on either hyperkagom network Mean field calculations based on dipolar interactions have been performed to understand the stability of this ground state and its behavior in applied magnetic field 5  with reasonable success Nd3Ga5O12 NdGG is the only known member of the RGGs which exhibits however a different magnetic order TN  052 K corresponding to Ia-3d  which means that the orientation between the two hyperkagom networks is reversed with respect to other RGGs This ground state cannot be stabilized by dipolar interactions only according to mean field calculations but requires an additional magnetic exchange term in the Hamiltonian of the Moriya or pseudo-dipolar type  This additional term is not merely a perturbation as specific heat measurements show that only 8 of the dipolar interactions contribute to the magnetic energy in NdGG to be compared with 77 in ErGG  This additional exchange is evaluated to be around 042 K Figure 1 Two blue and pink intertwined hyperkagome networks in RGG only the R lattice is shown Figure 2 Magnetic ordering in rare earth garnet Tb3Ga5O12 R ions forming a triangle have moments along a yellow b dark blue or c red Light blue and orange spins distinguish moments on the two hyperkagom subnetworks Magnetic order in NdGG can be visualized as a 180 flip of the spins on one of the two hyperkagoms Figure 3  Crystal field excitations measured by inelastic neutron scattering 2TLLB in a single crystal of NdGG at 4 K Proposed experiment To gain a better understanding of the Hamiltonian stabilizing the magnetic ground state of NdGG we would like to study its magnetic excitations and their temperature evolution using cold inelastic neutron scattering We have a large single crystal available Using the simulation tools developed at LLB RPA approximation our knowledge of the ordered structure Figure 2 and using the CEF scheme determined from crystal field excitations already measured at LLB see Figure 3 we intend to characterize the magnetic interactions between Nd moments in this compound Considering the results published in  the spin waves should be located in the 0 - 1 meV energy range We plan to map out the spin excitations for one orientation giving access to the high symmetry directions 111 110 and 001 The Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer MACS with its 20-channels detection system which simultaneously covers a large area of Q-space would be the best choice for our experiment As a very good energy resolution is likely needed less than 50 eV we would operate the spectrometer with a small final energy typically with Ei  25 meV and then measure Q-maps at various energies We will need to record excitation spectra below and above TN the latter to use as a reference We therefore apply for 6 days of beamtime on MACS with a dilution environment 1 day to cool down and install the dilution set up 4 days to explore the three high symmetry directions and 1 day to take data at high temperature References  Introduction to Frustrated Magnetism edited by C Lacroix P Mendels and F Mila Springer-Verlag Berlin 2011  L Balents Nature 464 199 2010  M Gingras et al Rep Prog Phys 77 056501 2014  J Hammann thse CEA R3866 1969  HW Capel Phys Lett 11 7 1964  HW Capel Physica 31 1152 1965  E Bidaux et al J Phys 29 57 1968  J Phys 29 357 1968  J Hammann Phys Lett 26A 263 1968  DG Onn et al Phys Rev 156 663 1967
