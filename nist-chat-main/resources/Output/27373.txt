 Page 1 of 3 Cavitation and precipitation processes in structural alloys for extreme environments Scientific Importance The goal of the eXtremeMAT XMAT National Laboratory Consortium is to develop a suite of computational tools physics-based descriptive and predictive models and reduced-order predictive models to accelerate the development cycle of cost-effective alloys for applications in transformational power generation technologies involving extreme environments and to predict their service life in these applications XMAT is organized into the thrusts Modeling and Simulation Materials CharacterizationModel Validation Data Analytics and Manufacturing Science The Modeling and Simulation thrust is developing models that include a physically-based single crystal constitutive equations b appropriate consideration of polycrystalline microstructure and c efficient numericalcomputational implementation for a chemistry- and microstructure-sensitive description of damage and fracture of steels of different compositions undergoing creep at different temperatures and subjected to multi-axial stresses The Materials CharacterizationModel Validation thrust is responsible for designing and performing experiments that provide data for calibrating models filling gaps in understanding crystal plasticity and deformation andor for validating computational model predictions This tandem approach is expected to significantly reduce the time and cost for alloy development and lifetime prediction Both uniaxial sheet and multi-axial tube ex-situ creep-tested samples will be studied for their microstructural responses using SANSUSANS which offers the advantage of being non-destructive and yielding statistical information on second phase precipitation and coarsening as well as nucleation and growth of creep voids at the grain boundaries Results from this investigation will help fill gaps in understanding deformation and damage processes and for validating computational model predictions of creep deformation cavitation nucleation and growth and precipitation and coarsening of strengthening phases Preliminary Work Our previous neutron scattering work focused on the corrosion properties of different steels 3- Using SANS we studied austenitic AFA steels corroded 800C in dry and humid air for different amounts of time During SANS analysis scattering from the oxidation features was separated from the alloy structure scattering and quantified using a polydisperse hard sphere model In the alloy scattering metal precipitates dominated at low Q Q0005 -1 see Figure 1 Using subtraction techniques the different structures present in the samples were individually characterized We intend to use similar techniques for the analysis of the even more complex structures and processes expected in these samples Choice of Instrument We request beam time at the NG7 SANS and BT5 USANS instruments which combined cover the size range of interest ca 1 nm - 15 micron We expect strong small-angle scattering in all samples which should limit run times and allow good overlap between the instruments We would like to measure a total of 3 flat samples and 3 tubular samples with each sample creep tested at a different temperature SANS measurements will be performed after interrupting creep tests at predetermined periods of time To measure this sample set over the entire accessible Q-ranges of the instruments 1E-5 -1  Q  1 -1 combined we request 2 days of beam time at the SANS instrument and 8 days at the USANS instrument Figure 1 SANS curves obtained for AFA stainless steel exposed ex situ to heat treatment at 800C in dry air The encircled region at low Q shows the formation and growth of precipitates with annealing The sizes of these intermetallic precipitates increased approximately linearly with reaction time from an approximate diameter of 80 nm for the 8h sample to ca 170 nm for the 144 h sample These findings are consistent with the microscopy results and thus provide verified statistical information about alloy microstructures not easily accessible by other methods  Page 2 of 3 Figure 2 Typical examples of alloy microstructures anticipated in our samples Experiment Plan Three alloys will be studied a commercially-available 347H austenitic stainless steel to serve as a benchmark nanoscale MX carbonitride and M23C6 strengthened alloy and two model developmental alumina-forming austenitic AFA stainless steels employing different strengthening strategies a coherent nanoscale gamma prime Ni3Al strengthened AFA alloy X354  and a multi-scale Laves phase nano to micron range  carbide nanoscale M23C6 strengthened AFA alloy X201  B2-NiAl phase precipitation is also anticipated in the AFA alloys as are the presence of coarse primary carbides The AFA alloys are of great recent interest for high-temperature use in steam-containing extreme environments due to their superior oxidation resistance to conventional chromia-forming stainless steels such as 347H and the opportunity to engage different and multiple high-temperature strengthening mechanisms Austenitic stainless steels for high-temperature use are placed in service in the as-solution annealed near single-phase FCC matrix microstructure condition with precipitation of strengthening phases in course of the service typically in the 600-800C range SANS is ideal to gain insight and quantify the formation and size evolution of the 2nd phase precipitates with kinetics assessed by study of ex-situ creep-deformed samples tested under different stresses temperatures and durations SANS will also provide insights into creep void nucleation and growth Three flat samples and 3 tubular samples with each sample having a variable width or thickness to achieve different stress levels on the sample will be creep tested at a different temperature SANS measurements will be performed after interrupting creep tests at predetermined periods of time to determine how microstructural features of interest eg cavities and precipitates evolve as a function of time stress and temperature Data Analysis and Scientific Outcomes The obtained SANSUSANS data will be reduced and analyzed using methods that the PIs have used extensively in the past two- and three-phase modeling of precipitate and void phases Guinier and Porod analysis and polydisperse hard-sphere modeling We will separate second-phase precipitate scattering from creep void scattering experimentally by subjecting samples to the same temperature treatments with and without applied stress Our to be tested hypothesis is that precipitates and creep voids develop independently do not interfere and can therefore be treated additively in the data analysis Phase prediction through thermodynamic calculation will be made for the analyzed compositions of the creep test samples studied with post-test microstructural characterization planned by electron microscopy and atom probe tomography techniques to compare with and help interpret the SANS data Interpretation will be performed in tandem with SEMTEM and EDXdiffraction analysis Predicted rates of void nucleation and growth from physics-based models under development within XMAT will be validated with the results from the proposed experiments Safety Considerations The samples will be prepared ex-situ The austenitic steel samples are non-hazardous but might slightly activate during the neutron experiments No sample environment beside a multi-position sample holder is needed Page 3
