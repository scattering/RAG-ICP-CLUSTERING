Disentangling magnetism and phonons in magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 Abstract We propose to map out the low-energy excitations in highly magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 CFO at base temperature 10 K and room temperature Recent studies using triple-axis spectrometers have been hampered by overlapping magnons phonons and possibly spin-orbit transitions The use of MACS to map out several Brillouin zones simultaneously will allow us to disentangle phonon and magnetic excitations in this material This information will shed light on the microscopic origin of the magnetostriction and facilitate future efforts to characterize the acoustic phonons as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field using triple-axis spectrometers We will search for momentum and energy broadened excitations analogous to those observed in the lattice dynamics in lead based relaxor ferroelectrics The measurement will also facilitate the establishment of the underlying energy scales for the magnetism which is expected to be large given that the Curie temperature is 860 K We note that we have also put in a proposal on this to MERLIN with our goal of obtaining the low-energy spectrum on MACS and the higher energy on MERLIN Introduction Ferrite magnetostrictive materials are critical to magnetoelectric heterostructures and their various applications12 These include electric-field-controlled magnetoelectric ME random access MeRAMs2 memories logic devices3 and even solid-state synapse-like neuromorphic learning4 Yet despite their widespread use the mechanism underlying the high magnetostriction in ferrites remains unclear Previously it was shown that polar nano-regions PNRs play a key role in enhancing the piezoelectric properties of PbMg13Nb23O3-PbTiO3 PMN-PT crystals due to a high density of low-energy domain walls5 Evidence of a high twin-wall density has also recently been reported in ferrites However it is not known how these nano-scale magnetic regions affect the lattice and spin dynamics which are intimately connected to the magnetostrictive response For this reason further studies of ferrites using neutron inelastic scattering methods are essential to develop a deeper understanding of and possibly enhance the magnetostrictive coefficient in magnetostrictive materials such as CFO Characterizing the structure and dynamics associated with such nano-scale regions should help guide efforts to design materials with larger magnetostrictive coefficients and thus improve the performance of actual magnetostrictive-related devices Structure and Magnetism CFO exhibits an inverse spinel structure space group Fd3m in which the unit cell contains 32 oxygen ions 8 Co 2 ions occupying octahedrally coordinated B sites and 16 Fe 3 ions that are distributed almost equally between the tetrahedral A sites and B sites6 therefore displaying site disorder The compound undergoes a collinear ferrimagnetic transition below Tc  860 K7 The large magnetic ordering temperature maybe indicative of a large exchange constant The magnetic excitations therefore may extend up to high energies and therefore we wish to measure these on a chopper instrument Preliminary Work Two single crystals of CFO were sent to NIST for initial neutron scattering measurements Data were collected using the thermal triple-axis spectrometer BT4 and a typical constant-Q scan is shown in Fig 1 Both crystals were found to be of excellent quality the mosaic spread is less than 05 degrees FWHM and the Bragg and phonon intensities are extremely strong These preliminary data confirm that the crystals are suitable for further study using neutron inelastic scattering methods An extremely broad and dispersive peak was observed at higher energies in both the 400 and 220 Brillouin zones It disperses unusually rapidly to energies above 20 meV at large k This behavior could reflect that of a magnon or spin wave8 The details of this unique and unusual scattering will be important and interesting to study going forward Neutron scattering measurements were also performed in different Brillouin zones Neutron scattering measurements were conducted along 4k4-k0 and 2k2-k0 where the wave vector k was varied from 000 to 020 rlu We found strong phonon scattering near 440 However additional inelastic scattering was observed near 220 that is not present near 440 We therefore believe that it is magnetic in origin One possibility is that the extremely broad energy width of the magnetic scattering is consistent with very short lifetimes This is consistent with the high possibility that it involves some type of disordermechanism and or structural heterogeneity Another possibility is that the magnetic excitations extend up to very high energies and analogous to the cuprates difficult to resolve at low energies using a triple-axis However further measurements are needed to determine the microscopic mechanism requiring higher energy transfers and also broad momentum and energy coverage Experiment plan Two single crystals with masses of 995 g and 774 g total 18 g will be co-aligned and mounted in an aluminum holder such that reflections of the form HK0 lie within the horizontal scattering plane We will use a final energy of Ef5 meV with a Be filter on the scattered side This measurement should allow us to obtain data up to 15 meV in energy transfer over several Brillouin zones While this is not large enough to sample the spin-orbit transitions expected near 30 meV it will provide a high resolution measurement of the low-energy fluctuations We will focus our measurements at base temperature 5 K and perform constant energy scans for the first 3-4 days The remainder of the time will be spent repeating these measurements at room temperature We estimate we will need 1 day for setup and overhead so we request a total of 6 days for this experiment References 1 M Bibes and A Barthelemy Nat Mater 7 6 425 2008
