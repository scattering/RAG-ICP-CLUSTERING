The interplay between lipid membranes and antimicrobial peptide Tilapia Piscidin 4 General Scope The innate immune response which is the first line of defense against an infection or injury is mediated by a variety of immune effector molecules that regulate molecular recognition at the plasma membrane Metal-binding host-defense peptides derived from the innate immune systems of various organisms are promising templates for designing new and potent antibiotics Host-defense peptides HDPs feature evolution-tested efficacy against a broad range of pathogenic cells including bacteria viruses and fungi One of the most recently discovered HDPs is Tilapia Piscidin 4 TP4 TP4 FIHHIIGGLFSAGKAIHRLIRRRRR is an HDP isolated from Nile tilapia with an arginine-rich tail It has a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the micromolar range 1 and it is less toxic to normal eukaryotic cells compared to other piscidins 2 It has been shown to inhibit the growth of multidrug resistant Helicobacter pylori which is associated with gastric diseases such as gastric cancer gastritis ulcer3 It also has a potential as a therapeutic agent for treating triple-negative breast cancer4 These interesting findings prompt the question of the mechanisms of action of TP4 Like other piscidins TP4 binds Copper Cu2 and Nickel Ni2 through a conserved Amino-Terminal CuNi ATCUN binding motif While biological cell-based assays have been useful in demonstrating the antimicrobial and anticancer activity of TP4 they have not provided direct information to explain these effects on a molecular level In addition the role of the metal-binding in the activity of TP4 at the membrane level has not been studied Figure 1 Deuterium profiles for P3-Cu in a POPC bilayer The profiles for the POPC bilayer with unlabeled P3-Cu black and water blue are overlaid right panel The oriented samples were prepared in POPC at 125 peptidelipid molar ratio and measured at 93 relative humidity and 23 oC using the vapor phase of saturated salt solutions In recent investigations we used neutron diffraction to study the bilayer conformation of piscidin 3 deuterium labelled metal-bound P3 Fig 1 and with or without Cu2 Fig 2 We determined their position and orientation in the bilayer and also their effects on the bilayer structure and water distribution We showed that Cu2 binding dramatically increases P3s ability to insert Fig 2 and pull water with it in the bilayer hydrocarbon The results obtained by using deuterium labelled P3-Cu showed that the peptide is inserted through its Cu-bound N-terminus that positions itself close to the oxidation-prone double bond of the oleic chains of the lipid Fig 1 This raises the possibility for additional structural damage to the bilayer through lipid oxidation Overall the diffraction results correlate directly with the observed cytotoxicity of P3 on cancer cells and in particular the gain in potency of P3 upon metal binding Comert et al manuscript in preparation Thus binding of the metal ion can simply change peptide conformation and interactions with the lipids and water leading to an increased ability of the peptides to perturb and permeate the bilayer Fig 1 In this proposal we are aiming to understand some of the aspects pointed here by using Neutron Diffraction ND Figure 2 The bilayer scattering length density profiles SLD in projection to the bilayer normal z-axis The profiles bilayer and water for the pure POPC without peptides is shown as dotted lines The oriented samples were prepared in POPC at 125 peptidelipid molar ratio and measured at 93 relative humidity and 23 oC using the vapor phase of saturated salt solutions Preliminary investigations and feasibility Diffraction measurements Previously deuterium profiles of the specifically deuterated non-metallated peptides at position 5-6 near the N-terminus I5F6 and position 19-20 near the C-terminus F19V20 were determined by deuterium difference analysis between homologous pairs of protonated-deuterated peptide samples5 The study demonstrates the unique power of neutrons to resolve conformations position and orientation of peptides in the bilayer concomitant with revealing effects of the peptides on the bilayer structure perturbation In this investigation we will use deuterated TP4 with or without bound Cu2 to fully determine its conformation in the membrane We will carry out the similar measurements for TP4 and TP4-Cu as we did for P3P3-Cu Fig 1 Distinguishable conformation and perturbations can be revealed for metallated and non-metalled TP4 that can be directly related to its differing potencies Furthermore compared to other piscidins TP4 has 5 Arginine residues at its C-terminus We would like to investigate how this affects the orientation of the peptide in the bilayer and its hydration patterns compared to other piscidins 5 Experimental plan Sample Preparation Samples for diffraction measurements will be prepared as oriented lipid multilayers with TP4 using a recently developed protocol5 Briefly peptides dissolved in buffer is added directly to a dispersion of liposomes dissolved in the same buffer to the desired proteinlipid ratios A peptide to lipid PL ratio of 125 was demonstrated to work well in our previous studies and is chosen for this work for two reasons First this PL corroborates with the amount of peptides at which permeabilization in bacterial cell membrane mimics occur6 Second it provides sufficient signals for observing the peptide with neutron diffraction Fig 1 The proteo-liposomes are spread on thin glass cover slips and the bulk water was allowed to evaporate slowly overnight at room temperature Before diffraction experiments the samples are annealed at 93 relative humidity and 25  for at least 12 hours Specific Aims 1 Determining the conformation ie position and orientation of peptides in bilayers by using deuterium labeling Neutron diffraction performed on oriented lipid multilayers hydrated from the vapor phase provide the resolution necessary to resolve conformation of the peptide in the bilayer 2 Examine the bilayer structural perturbations and water penetration associated with those conformations and Arginine-rich C-terminus using H2OD2O exchange Time requirements Based on our previous investigations the measurement time at MAGIk is  7 hrs per conditioncontrast Diffraction measurements will include samples with metalled and non-metalled TP4 deuterated at C-terminus and also at both C-  N- termini as well as non-deuterated peptides Each needs to be measured in 3 H2OD2O contrasts for structure factor phase assignments and corrections This will require 6 days 6 peptides 4 deuterated and 2 non- deuterated TP4 and TP4-Cu x 3 H2OD2O contrasts x 7hrs  126 hours and one extra day for sample adjustment We request 7 days of beam time at MAGIk References 1 Peng KC et al
