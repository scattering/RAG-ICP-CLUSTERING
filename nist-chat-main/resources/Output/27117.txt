Small-Angle Neutron Scattering studies of bacterial colonization factors Cholera is an ancient and deadly diarrheal disease that is caused by the pathogen Vibrio cholerae The bacterium can easily survive in the ocean where it binds to plankton and crustaceans Upon ingestion of contaminated water or food the bacteria colonize the human small intestine where they secrete their major virulence factor the cholera toxin This proposal targets N-acetyl glucosamine binding protein A GbpA an important colonization factor of V cholerae  as well as homologues of GbpA from other bacteria and viruses GbpA has been shown to bind to chitin and intestinal mucin GbpA also binds to the surface of the bacteria  and we suspect that it might be to lipopolysaccharides LPS In addition GbpA has lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase LPMO activity towards chitin  GbpA is a four-domain protein of 51 kDa of which domains 1-3 have been crystallized and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering SAXS  Domain 1 is the catalytic domain Despite the available structural data the molecular mechanism of GbpA is still poorly understood In particular it is unknown how GbpA recognizes mucin and chitin The current study aims to elucidate the structure of GbpA in all its structural states free in solution bound to chitin and potentially also to mucin and LPS To study the structure of GbpA in complex with chitin we plan to use Small-Angle Neutron Scattering SANS In order to take full advantage of the D2OH2O contrast matching options that SANS offer we are currently producing perdeuterated GbpA both in our own laboratory and in collaboration with the ILL D-lab work in progress Already we can routinely produce high amounts of hydrogenated and 80  deuterated full-length GbpA approximately 20 mg per L media SAXS studies have shown a remarkably stable protein under a range of different conditions including a large pH range 1 to 8 different salts at different concentrations and different temperatures 4 C to 37 C SAXS and size-exclusion chromatography show monomeric and monodisperse protein except at very low salt concentrations and preliminary SAXS and SANS experiments suggest that also the deuterated protein behaves well We further observed that the properties of the individual components chitin and GbpA differ from that of the mixture suggesting efficient complex formation This is very fortunate since chitin nanofibers show limited solubility requiring a pH  5 which is unfavourable for GbpA The complex however behaves well at a range of different pH values also above pH 5 Planned SANS Experiments We plan to study the conformational change of GbpA upon binding to chitin in solution using SANS For this purpose we intend to use chitin nanofibers squid pen -chitin and later possibly also mucin and LPS The fibers can be matched out by contrast variation applying different ratios of D2OH2O We have recently experimentally determined the match point of chitin to be at 47  D2O Since the contrast match point for A Figure 1 A SAXS data for full-length GbpA at different salt concentrations B Schematic representation of the predicted conformational change of GbpA upon binding to chitin  B hydrogenated proteins is around 44  D2O the deuterated version of the protein is essential for this study After studies of GbpA are completed we will extend the project to other homologues For interaction experiments between GbpA and chitin we plan to use 2 mgmL GbpA and slightly higher amounts of chitin The chitin nanofibers have estimated dimensions of 10-20 nm in thickness and are several m long Note that the stoichiometry between GbpA and chitin nanofibers is unknown We will measure at the chitin match point to see the conformation of the protein when bound to chitin and we will measure at the protein match point to see conformational changes to the chitin exploring several different conditions concerning salts temperature and pH We will use 80  deuterated GbpA for these experiments The estimated time needed for the planned experiments buffer measurements included 1 Measurement on chitin alone at different concentrations at match point 47  and at 100  D2O 12 hours 2 Measurement on non-deuterated and deuterated GbpA at 2 mgmL in 0  47  and 100  D2O buffer 12 hours 3 Measurement on GbpA  chitin at chitin match point under different conditions 12-16 hours 4 Measurement on GbpA  chitin at GbpA match point under different conditions 12-16 hours 5 Corresponding measurements for GbpA homologues 24 hours Please note that we will need 3 instrument configurations to span the q-range 0004 - 04 -1 A fourth configuration can be useful for the chitin measurements to reach a qmin of 0001 -1 For the analysis we will perform standard Guinier and pair-distance distribution analysis on reduced Iq vs q data followed up by structural modeling of GbpA alone and in complex with chitin The full-length atomic solution structure of GbpA will be modeled using standard Molecular Dynamics techniques and missing regions will then be added using Monte Carlo techniques Theoretical SANS curves will be calculated from the model structures and compared to the experimental data Chitin will be modeled using standard models for fibers and fiber networks Alternatively the different scattering contributions from chitin and protein can be obtained by singular value decomposition analysis Estimation of scattering length densities and contrast match points Chitin C8H7O5NH6 where H is exchangeable protons apparent theoretical density is 16 gcm Neutron scattering length density SLD is 204300X10-6 -
