Research Title Visualisation of Water Management in an EHC using Neutron Imaging Radiography  Tomography Introduction The electrochemical hydrogen compressor EHC is a device that can compress hydrogen to pressures  350 barg for storage in high-pressure tanks at re-fuelling stations for re-fuelling hydrogen cars and busses An EHC consists of two Ti bipolar plates gas diffusion layers GDL and a Nafion membrane The membrane needs to be humidified to maximize its conductivity - therefore the hydrogen supplied to the EHC needs to be humidified  As an electrical current is applied to the EHC H2 oxidized at the anode to form H protons which then travels through the membrane and reduces again to H2 molecules at the cathode  Electro osmotic-drag directly proportional to the applied current occurs where the protonated hydrogen tends to drag water molecules through the membrane This can cause the membrane to dry out Too much humidity in the supply gas in combination with a low electrical current may cause the formation of water droplets inside the GDL or on the surface of the membrane  This will block hydrogen access to the catalytic site and reduces the efficiency and performance Experimental setup Figure 1 shows the experimental system used to operate an EHC A hydrogen generator is connected to a gas humidification system that controls the humidity and temperature of the hydrogen gas supplied to the EHC inlet A water-gas separator is filled halfway with water to allow the PID controller to control MFM 1 and MFM 2 which allows precise control of the percentage of humidified hydrogen gas supplied to the EHC inlet The inlet flow of hydrogen to the EHC needs to be held at a constant rate of 100mlmin and needs to be vented out continuously This ensures that the Nafion membrane which absorbs moisture stays properly humidified The EHC cell is connected to a DC power supply and the mass-flow rate of hydrogen that is pumped from the anode to the cathode side of the cell is directly proportional to the applied current To compress hydrogen up to 30 barg the sweep gas supply side of the cell is blocked off with a Swagelok cap and a pressure gauge is connected to the outlet of the cell The active area of the EHC is 7 cm2 which will require a maximum of 7 amperes to reach a current density of 1 Acm-2 DC Power supply07 V 7 AmpHydrogengeneratorHumidifierwater bubbling EHC CellHumidifiedhydrogensupplyHeating elementto controlcell temperatureHydrogen ventProduct gas outletCompressed hydrogenSweep gas supplyArgon  Nitrogen RH sensorDry H2supplyHumidification controlMFM 1MFM 2 CKV 1Dry H2 Humidified H2  Figure 1 Experimental design of the PEMWE setup Equipment list needed HySA Infrastructure CoC will be able to supply the GDLs membranes EHC cell assembly and a custom-made humidifier Hydrogen a mass-flow controller as well as the DC power supply that is adjustable in 50 mA increments will be supplied by NIST Experimental test protocol Setup of equipment and initial testing will take about 3 hours With each membrane being tested at no pressure and 25C a polarization curve will be generated in 005 Acm increments up to 10 Acm Each point on the polarization curve takes about 15 minutes and there are 20 points This amounts to 3 hours and 40 minutes Repeating the same test with pressure at 30 barg will take up to 5 hours and 40 minutes as the cell can take 2 hours to reach 30 barg pressure Each membrane swap will take up to an hour Two membranes will be tested as well as two GDLs The best combination will be retested at two different temperatures and pressures In a refuelling station pressures above 350 barg is desired in industry however it will only be tested up to 30 barg for safety reasons All neutron radiography measurements will be done through-plane Neutron radiography will be used to quantify the water content within the membrane surface to determine the correct humidification percentage required as a function of applied current to ensure high efficiency as well as reliable operation of the EHC Neutron radiography will also be used to identify possible water clogging if it occurs within the GDL We will follow a similar approach as done by Hussey et al  Table I Beam-time breakdown Procedure Test item Time Pressure Temperature -
