Search for Magnetic Excitation in Spin-Triplet Superconductor Candidate UTe2 Scientific Importance Conventional and most unconventional superconductors have electrons with antiparallel spins forming spin-singlet Cooper pairs Spin-triplet superconductors TSC on the other hand have electrons forming Cooper pairs in spin-triplet state analogous to the equal spin paring ESP state in the superfluid 3He  The spin-1 and dissipationless electron-electron bound states in TSC make these materials great hosts for topological superconductivity Majorana physics and therefore quantum computing  Until recently only a few materials have been proven to be TSC candidates including UPt3  Sr2RuO4  UBe13  the organic Benchgaard salts  and heterostructures consisting of ferromagnet and s-wave superconductors  Recently experimental evidences of spin-triplet paring have been discovered in UTe2  and the system soon draws attentions in the community UTe2 is a heavy fermion superconductor with TC  16 K and an orthorhombic unit cell 81 U atoms form parallel chains along a-axis inside trigonal prisms of Te atoms as shown in Fig 1 A Curie-Weiss fit on the magnetic susceptibility data reveals an effective moment on U atom close to the 5f2 or 5f3 free ion value at high temperature 1 No long-range magnetic order has been reported down to base temperature 81 Instead a sudden raise of the magnetic susceptibility below 10 K with field parallel to a-axis resembles the quantum critical behavior of metallic ferromagnets indicating strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuation along a-axis  This suggests that UTe2 sits at the paramagnetic end of a series of ferromagnetic heavy fermion superconductors as shown in the phase diagram in Fig 2 8 111 At the ferromagnetic end the compound UGe2 is a pressure-induced superconductor with optimal TC  05 K at 12 GPa 1 Moving to the left along the horizontal axis the spin fluctuation increases resulting in the enhancement of TC and the suppression of ferromagnetic long-range order These compositions share the feature of high upper critical field HC2 and strong anisotropy 8 111 indicating the spin-triplet paring state The signatures of spin-triplet Cooper pairing in UTe2 have been found via its very high HC2 a power-law behavior of the electronic specific heat and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate in the SC state and a temperature-independent nuclear magnetic resonance NMR Knight shift across TC  To further confirm the triplet nature a more direct probe on the spin state of the Cooper pairs is required And neutron scattering is a good choice Unlike the normal spin-singlet superconductors the spin-1 Cooper pairs in TSC could lead to nontrivial spin wave dispersion For instance if the strong spin anisotropy in UTe2 verified by magnetic susceptibility and upper critical field measurements in the paramagnetic state were carried down to the SC state a gap will be opened at the Gamma point Furthermore ferromagnetic spin fluctuation near TC can lead to short-range spin waves which has been observed in other TSC candidates UGe2 URhGe and Sr2RuO4 141 In the case of Sr2RuO4 excitation due to ferromagnetic fluctuation was found at an incommensurate Q  07 03 0 in a Fig 1 Crystal structure of UTe2 Space group Immm 71 Fig 2 Phase diagram of the ferromagnetic heavy fermion SC Fig 3 Picture of the largest piece of single crystal UTe2 sample large energy transfer range 05  40 meV with a weak energy dependence 182 Several theoretical works have predicted spin-triplet induced resonance which would enhance the ferromagnetic fluctuation excitation in a TSC with SC gap having p-wave or higher orbital momentum 212 Unfortunately recent inelastic neutron study on Sr2RuO4 have proven the absent of such resonance across TC 19 2 contributing to the already controversial discussion of spin-triplet pairing in Sr2RuO4 and other intrinsic-TSC candidates Gathering information on the spin anisotropy and the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation can provide insights on the paring mechanism and help confirm the spin-triplet state We therefore propose to investigate the zero-field magnetic excitation in UTe2 using inelastic neutron scattering with the goal of searching for spin anisotropy and resonance of the ferromagnetic fluctuation excitation to verify the spin state of the Cooper pairing in UTe2 Preliminary Work As mentioned before experimental studies on UTe2 covered transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements NMR Knight shift measurement and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation measurement  So far there has not been any published result on neutron scattering of this system Inelastic neutron scattering studies on compounds at the ferromagnetic end of the phase diagram UGe2 and URhGe have been reported by several groups including M Kepa et al 1 S Raymond et al 1 C Stock et al 1 and M Taopin et al 1 Evidences of spin fluctuations due to the ferromagnetic coupling were reported in the sub 1 meV region Similar works on Sr2RuO4 have shown incommensurate ferromagnetic fluctuation excitation in a wide energy range with weak energy dependence and an absent of the predicted spin resonance Choice of Instrument We choose MACS for its high energy resolution at low energy transfer region The energy ranges of the spin fluctuations in similar compounds are below 1 meV The energy ranges of the spin fluctuations in UGe2 and URhGe are below 1 meV whereas in SrRuO4 the excitation depends weakly on energy in a wide range of 0540 meV Therefore we expect the possible spin excitations in UTe2 to be observable close to the quasielastic range MACS is a high-resolution cold neutron spectrometer with large Q-space coverage The instrument is specialized in finding low energy magnetic excitation which fits the interests of our research perfectly Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We plan to perform inelastic neutron scattering on coaligned single crystals of UTe2 The typical size of the crystals is 2 by 2 by 1 mm3 and the total mass is 1 g The experiment aims at inelastic channel in low energy transfer in the 0KL scattering plane A quick map will be collected at base temperature then individual scans will be focused on the observed excitations The data will be fitted with the double Lorentzian form to determine the inverse correlation length and the relaxation time of the excitation There are two key temperatures 1 the onset of ferromagnetic fluctuation along a-axis at 10 K and 2 the superconducting transition TC  16 K Temperature dependence of the excitation across these two will provide information on 1 the ferromagnetic fluctuation contribution to the excitation below 10 K and 2 evidence of spin resonance in the SC state Therefore we propose to measure the coaligned sample in the quasielastic range 0  1 meV at the following temperature points K 05 1 15 2 5 10 40 The total beam time requested is 7 days References  D M Lee Rev Mod Phys 69 645-665 1997  J
