 Page 1 of 2 Investigate the magnetic chirality of a new multiferroic RbFeSO42 Scientific Importance Multiferroics that simultaneously exhibit ferroelectric and magnetic orders have attracted much attention due to their intriguing physics such as the nature of the competing magnetic interactions and their coupling to the lattice degree of freedom1  Recently we synthesized high quality single crystals of a new material RbFeSO42 RFSO Figure 1a and b show the ferroelectric polarization of RFSO as a function of temperature At 0 T the polarization starts to grow at 5G5A  4 K suggesting the onset of multiferroelectricity The polarization also exhibits a very strong response to magnetic field indicating the strong magnetoelectric coupling in RFSO The phase diagram shown in Fig 1d summarizes the results of Fig 1a and b The nature of multiferroic properties in RFSO is not clear Understanding the physics of RFSO calls for a detailed study of its magnetic structure In this proposal we focus on its magnetic structure in a temperature range from 15 K to 10 K Fe3 ions carrying spin S  52 form a triangular lattice We expect a chiral incommensurate magnetic structure with a wave vector of 13 13 qz in RFSO single crystal where qz is an irrational number The in-plane spin configuration might be the so-called 120 structure with spins lying in the triangular plane while the chirality and incommensurability are along the c-axis In order to test our hypothesis we propose to study the magnetic structure and chirality of RFSO single crystal using polarized neutron scattering method at BT7 triple axis spectrometer BT7 is capable of polarized neutron beam operation and it is an ideal tool for our purpose Preliminary Work Figure 1 Ferroelectric polarization as a function of temperature at various magnetic fields at a 40 kVcm and b -40 kVcm electric field c Phase diagram We measured the ferroelectric polarization along c direction as a function of temperature As we can see from Fig 1a and b polarization starts to grow at 5G5A  4 K suggesting the onset of multiferroelectricity With increasing the magnetic field along ab plane the transition temperature gradually shifts to lower temperature and finally disappears at H  6 T within our available temperature range The results of ferroelectric polarization are summarized in the phase diagram shown in Fig 1c Clearly there are three different phases in the RFSO The magnetic structure is unknown We expect that multiferroelectricity of RFSO may arise from the magnetic chirality of Fe spins In summary it is quite worthwhile to determine the magnetic structure and chirality of RFSO c Page 2 of 2 Figure 2 a XRD of a RFSO single crystal Insert shows a photo of our single crystal b and c possible lattice structures of RFSO We have performed XRD on RFSO single crystal As shown in Fig 2a the XRD of a RFSO single crystal shows very sharp 00L peaks suggesting the high quality of our samples highly oriented along c The crystal photo in the inset of Fig 2a was taken by polarized optical microscope It does not show any hints of multi domains for the ab direction in a scale of mm Experiment Plan We need single crystal neutron scattering data in a temperature range from 15 K to 10 K to determine the magnetic structural signatures of the multiferroic properties of RFSO High quality single crystals of RFSO have been synthesized Our single crystals have a typical size of 4 mm  4 mm  2 mm We propose to study the magnetic structure as a function of temperature using polarized neutron scattering We would like to measure 3 temperature points with T  10 K 4 K and 15 K crossing the transition temperatures 4 K For each temperature point it would take up to 10 hours Thus we request a total of 2 days to look at these scans for the good statistical accuracy including the time for sample loading and cooling References  W Eerenstein N D Mathur and J F Scott Nature 442 7592006  S -W Cheong and M Mostovoy Nat Mater 6 132007
