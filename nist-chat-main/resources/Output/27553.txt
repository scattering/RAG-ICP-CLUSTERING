 1 Interactions of hydrogen in polymers at small length scales USANSSANS studies of select polymers in high-pressure hydrogen D Barton Smith1 and Lawrence M Anovitz2 1Energy and Transportation Science Division and 2Chemical Sciences Division Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL Scientific background and aims The DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fuel Cell Technologies Office has established a multi-year program for Science-Based Advancement of Materials for Hydrogen Technologies H-Mat Significant gaps exist in our understanding of materials behavior in hydrogen particularly polymer materials and this knowledge gap may significantly affect progress in fuel cell and hydrogen energy initiatives ORNL is a collaborator with other DOE National Laboratories in an endeavor to elucidate the mechanisms of hydrogen degradation of materials in the context of material micro-structures and morphologies In this program both experimental and computational studies in the first few years will focus on understanding fundamental inter-actions of materials and microstructures at small length scales due to the complexity of real-world engineering materials The use of polymers and polymer nano-composites in hydrogen fuel environments has the potential to significantly improve the durability and reduce the cost of hydrogen H2 fuel systems and the associated hydrogen distribution and dispensing infrastructure For example in a fuel cell vehicle the H2 fuel system and associated infrastructure contains a hydrogen storage tank with an impermeable polymer liner overwrapped with a carbon fiberepoxy resin system  These are significantly less expensive and lighter than steel-based systems with comparable storage capacities The polymer liner materials that are directly exposed to gaseous H2 have typically been high-density polyethylene HDPE or nylons which are chosen for their excellent combination of low hydrogen permeability and low cost However in these and other polymer systems H2 is suspected to degrade the polymers during the lifecycle  In H2 fuel systems gaseous H2 fuels are stored at pressures as high as 70 MPa while the fueling station storage dispensing system can be at significantly higher pressures Various systems capable of performing mechanical tests in hydrogen environments have been developed to investigate the effect of pressurized H2 on the mechanical response of liner polymer components but the structuralmorphological mechanisms responsible for such mechanical responses is still far from being understood This is due to the lack of enabling in situ methodologies for investigating the structure For example the use of X-ray scattering is limited because pressure cells use thick high-atomic-number materials to contain the high pressure and an X-ray beam is absorbed and attenuated by such materials On the other hand ultra-small-angle neutron scattering USANS and small-angle neutron scattering SANS provide a unique and specific opportunity for such studies due to the low neutron absorption cross section of many such materials and the sensitivity of neutrons to hydrogen It is well known that some gases such as carbon dioxide CO2 are effective solvents for some polymers at high pressures Consequently exposure to these gases at high pressures will affect the polymer mechanical properties and the failure mode of the polymers can change significantly and for the worse  In the case of hydrogen since it exists in the form of diatomic molecules in polymers a state not seen in metals or alloys it is expected that hydrogen is chemically inert with respect to polymers under normal pressures The aim of this proposal is to understand the interactions that may occur in specific polymers thermoplastics and elastomers at the microstructure level and to elucidate the potentially consequential impact of such interactions on polymer morphology and failure modes Failure could be mainly due to diffusion of H2 into polymer matrix in the inter-spherulite amorphous and inter-lamellar amorphous regions followed by blistering local solvation or swelling of polymeric materials It could also be due to expansion of adsorbed or solvated hydrogen that may occur during the slow outgassing during depressurization To clarify the exact origin for the failure we are investigating the morphologic 2 changes of specific polymers when they are exposed to H2 in real-time at high pressure and various temperatures and after H2 depressurization Evolution of pore structure can be studied in situ using USANS and SANS instruments when a pressure cell is used in the sample environment For in situ studies USANS and SANS data will be collected at varying pressures of hydrogen and the reduced data will be modeled to determine the effects of H2 pressure Progressive microstructural damage can be studied ex situ using samples that have been cycled extensively between low 10 bar and high 100 bar pressure of hydrogen The ex situ results are expected to provide an improved understanding of the microstructure of semi-crystalline and amorphous regions and mechanisms for local blister formation during depressurization Successful completion of this work will also contribute to the database of information on hydrogen transport through polymer systems as a function of pressure and temperature thereby providing a design basis for polymer systems in vehicle hydrogen fuel systems and associated infrastructure Preliminary results In an earlier study that combined ex situ USANS and SANS  of HDPE that had been subjected to 4000 temperature cycles between -30 and 85C while differentially pressurized with hydrogen we found evidence of structural changes due to the temperature cycling The stitched USANSSANS data for the before-cycling and after 4000-cycle HDPE specimens are shown in Figure 1 The scattering data was analyzed as follows 4 the low-q section was fit using a Guinier-Porod model the central section was fit using a flexible cylinder with a polydispersed radius model and the high-q section was fit to a polydispersed Gaussian sphere model The presence of low-q scattering in the USANSSANS data indicates the presence of large-scale 30 m scattering features that change significantly with long-term exposure to H2 and increasing number of temperature cycles Similarly the presence of high q scattering appears only after temperature cycling We interpret this analysis as evidence that significant changes in pore structure occurred as the cycling progressed Figure 2 shows stitched USANSSANS data for obtained during preliminary measurements on several thermoplastics that were pressure-cycled in hydrogen At the SANS scales no changes were observed most probably because the samples were subject to a small number of cycles 22 at moderately high pressures 300 bar Ex situ USANSSANS provides information about the final pore structure structural change after all sample treatment but it has limitations in investigating the process of interaction between polymer component and pressurized H2 We expect the in situ capabilities available in the sample environment at the USANS and SANS beamlines will be very characterize the interaction and the resultant structure formation process occurring during H2 or D2 diffusion solvation compression or swelling and depressurization processes The structural information that can be obtained by in situ USANSSANS is very unique and invaluable in exploiting hydrogen storage and transport through polymeric hydrogen fuel systems and associated hydrogen infrastructure Figure 3 Stitched USANS and SANS curves for differentially pressurized HDPE liner specimens 0143 MPa before temperature cycling left and after 4000 temperature cycles right 3 Sample environment For in situ USANSSANS studies we expect to mount polymer samples in high-pressure gas cells at NG7 30m SANS and BT5 USANS Polymer samples will be immersed in hydrogen in the cell until a saturation equilibrium is reached Saturation times are on the order of a few hours to 1 day We have pressure cells rated for high-pressure hydrogen and will bring several cells to NIST to allow us to saturate samples in advance of our scheduled beam time We intend use hydrogen at static pressures in the range 100 to 1000 bar and we can bring with us a pressure intensifierbooster pump to provide the required hydrogen pressures if necessary Temperatures of interest are in the range 25 to 85C but we expect to conduct our experiments at ambient temperatures Proposed experiment and measurement time As model polymer systems we have chosen PA-11 POM PTFE HDPE PEEK and EPDM due to their low hydrogen permeability and industry-wide acceptance as hydrogen seals and barriers PA-11 and HDPE are used extensively as liners in high-pressure 70 MPa hydrogen storage tanks onboard fuel cell automobiles and buses POM is frequently used as the liner in cryogenic fill hoses at hydrogen fueling stations PTFE and EPDM are used to make seals eg O-rings and flat gaskets in high-pressure systems Samples of these materials are being pressure-cycled in hydrogen 1-100 MPa and will be used for the ex situ measurements However we expect that beam time will be available to study only a few of these polymers so the POM PTFE and EPDM systems will be top priority
