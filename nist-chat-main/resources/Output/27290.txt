Probing Excitations in Honeycomb-Lattice Compound NaMnCl3 Scientific Importance Honeycomb-lattice compounds are highly sought-after due to the potential to realize exotic physics such as Kitaev spin liquids and topological magnon bands Comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering and quantitative modelling are the key to understand the microscopic interactions in materials and identify novel physics Here we propose to a detailed study on the honeycomb-lattice compound NaMnCl3 It crystallizes in the trigonal space group R-3 with Mn2 ions forming honeycomb layers Fig 1 1 This structure is quite unique among vast numbers of compounds with chemical formula ABX3 where A is an alkali metal B is a transition metal and X is a halogen  Figure 1 Crystallographic and thermodynamic

plane Our bulk susceptibility measurement on single crystals shows an antiferromagnetic transition around 65K consistent with that reported in the literature  The fit to the zero-field-cool data between 50K and 200K gives a Curie-Weiss temperature 413K and an effective moment 560B which is quite close to the theoretical value of 592B from 5T5F5F  1 with 5F  52 and 5T 2 The saturation magnetization also agrees well with the theoretical value 5T5F  5B Furthermore the entropy change calculated from heat capacity data is consistent with that of a spin-52 system namely ln25F  1  ln6 All the thermodynamic data so far is in accordance with the Hunds rules prediction for Mn2 atoms where orbital degrees of freedom form a singlet and are therefore completely quenched The spin space is expected to be isotropic Upon a closer look this is not entirely true People have done extensive optical absorption works on insulating compounds with Mn2 atoms in octahedron environment in the 1980s including NaMnCl3 Transitions to first excited electronic levels 6A1g4T1g are ubiquitously present which are supposed to be both spin and electric dipole forbidden  The reason that such excitons exist is due to non-vanishing spin-orbital coupling 50meV which mixes the ground and first excited electronic levels It is small compare to cubic crystal field 1eV but much larger than exchange energy scale 1meV Edge-sharing octahedron geometry with spin-orbital coupling has the potential of creating off-diagonal exchanges and leading to exotic quasiparticle excitations In fact two magnon sidebands were observed in optical absorption experiments of NaMnCl3  One of them corresponds to a simultaneous creation of an exciton and annihilation of one thermally created magnon while the other one involves annihilation of three thermally created magnons  Magnon sideband is not uncommon  which also exists in other Mn2 compounds such as MnF3  and CsMnF3 1 but excitations involving three magnons is rather unusual This might be related to some peculiarities in the low energy magnon bands of NaMnCl3 which is in turn the manifestation of an interesting underlying Hamiltonian beyond a simple Heisenberg model Another hint for this is a notable non-linear region between 2 and 5 Tesla in the isothermal magnetization curves Fig 1e just before the saturation It was proposed to originate from biquadratic exchange interaction spin-wave interaction or a large magnetic anisotropy 111 One interesting fact is that the two-magnon continuum from spin-wave interaction can indeed be observed in large spin-52 system such as Rb2MnF41 In the context of much more recently development 2D honeycomb ferromagnets has attracted a lot of attention for its potential of realizing magnon bands with non-trivial topology 1 A recent theory work 1 shows spin-wave interactions give rise to a different renormalization behavior to the bare magnon band near Dirac crossing comparing to the fermionic counterpart qualitatively account for the anomalies in neutron scattering data of honeycomb ferromagnet CrBr3 from 1970s 1 Below 65K NaMnCl3 realizes a ferromagnetic ordering in the honeycomb plane with moments lying in the plane and a 5  0032 stacking pattern along c-axis 1 in contrast to CrBr3 CrI3 1 and CrSiTe3 1 where a simple ferromagnetic ordering along c-axis occurs The complex magnetic ordering of NaMnCl3 brings interesting behavior of heat capacity after the transition as shown in Fig 1g where a 2D ferromagnetic 5G-linear behavior 2 quickly supersedes 3D antiferro 5G-cubic scaling as temperature is lowered It is very interesting to ask what microscopic interactions create the easy-plane anisotropy in the ordered phase and stabilize the complex 3D stacking Moreover how does all of these affect the possible Dirac crossing in the magnon band of NaMnCl3 at the linear and non-linear level Objectives of the Proposed Experiment We propose a comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering experiment to map out the low energy magnon band of NaMnCl3 and reveal its peculiar features of possibly topological nature We have extensive experience of extracting an accurate Hamiltonian model by fitting to inelastic neutron spectrum with linear spin-wave theory and studying non-linear effects using 1S expansion and Landau-Liftshitz dynamics We have grown single crystals of good quality Fig 1h and 1k from direct melting and performed comprehensive thermodynamic characterization We are currently working on growing even larger single crystals from Bridgman method Experimental Configuration and Sample Environment We ask for 4 days of beam time on MACS with Orange Cryostat and 11T magnet to successfully complete the experiment We would like to collect single crystal data with good statistics at base temperature of 15K at zero field 2 days and saturation field of 10T 2 days References  Van Loon C J J and G C Verschoor Acta Crystallographica 296 1973 1224-1228  Kestigian M and W
