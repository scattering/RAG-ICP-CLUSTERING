Temperature Dependence of Anisotropy Gap of Fe3GeTe2 Scientific Importance The field of two-dimensional 2D magnetism is advancing rapidly since the discovery of numerous 2D magnetic materials such as CrI3  Cr2GeTe6  and Fe3GeTe2 3  These newly realized 2D magnets are an ideal platform to thoroughly examine the well-established theories of Ising XY Heisenberg and Kitaev models deepening our understanding of quantum materials In addition to their fundamental interests investigations on 2D magnetic materials also pave the way to future applications in novel spintronic devices In a conventional three-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet the Curie temperature  5G56  is determined by the magnetic exchange coupling and the low wave vector q  0 spin-wave energies follow the well-known quadratic dispersion relation 5  5G  575G52  where 575G is the spin-wave stiffness and 5G is the vanishingly small dipolar gap  According to the hydrodynamic and mode-mode coupling theories temperature dependence of the spin-wave stiffness vanishes at 5G56 via 575G  1  5G5G56 55 where 5 and 5 are critical exponents of the magnetic phase transition 6  When the dimensionality of the magnetic system is reduced from 3D to 2D Mermin and Wagner showed that the absence of long-range ferromagnetic FM or antiferromagnetic AFM order at finite temperature in spin-rotational invariant systems with magnetic interactions  Therefore the discovery of robust FM order in van der Waals vdW monolayers of CrI3  and Fe3GeTe2  raised an important question concerning the magnetic interactions that stabilize the long-range 2D FM order indicating that the continuous rotational symmetry in these 2D systems in broken Understanding the microscopic origin of the 2D FM order is crucial to find the key parameters to tune 5G56 to room temperature providing indispensable knowledge to achieve room-temperature spintronics technologies Our previous inelastic neutron scattering INS study on ferromagnet CrI3 9 1 has revealed that the in-plane and out-of-plane spin wave stiffnesses remain a finite value at 5G56 in spite of the vanishing magnetization at 5G56 In contrast the magnetic anisotropy gap at  point which is fully closed at 5G56  follows similar temperature dependence as the magnetic order parameter providing strong evidence that spin-orbit coupling SOC induced magnetic anisotropy instead of magnetic exchange coupling plays a dominant role in stabilizing the long range FM order in CrI3 To determine whether this phenomenon is general for 2D ferromagnets and provide further insights into 2D magnetism more experimental demonstrations are needed Therefore we propose to perform INS to study the spin dynamics of Fe3GeTe2 which offers opportunities to understand how the Hamiltonians of fundamental magnetism model behave in the 2D limit In addition to understanding the microscopic origin of the 2D FM order in vdW materials INS study on Fe3GeTe2 is also important for investigating and realizing quantum and topological phases in these materials As a candidate of nodal-line semimetal 1 Fe3GeTe2 forms with magnetic element Fe in a triangular lattice Strong SOC in this system and two neighboring magnetic ions sharing an edge bond give rise to a Kitaev directional exchange interaction As a consequence this compound is subject to the competition among the Heisenberg anisotropic and Kitaev exchange terms leading to the potential realization of topological phases and particles In essence investigation of Fe3GeTe2 by INS offers an opportunity to reveal the nature of low-dimensional magnetism and landscape quantum phase from a new perspective Previous Work Fe3GeTe2 is an itinerant ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 230 K 1 X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate that its crystal structure is composed of layered Fe3Ge substructure sandwiched by two layers of Te atoms and there is a van der Waals gap between the adjacent Te layers 1 The physical properties of Fe3GeTe2 have been investigated by a combination of magnetic susceptibility isotherm magnetization specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements revealing a magneto-crystalline anisotropy along the c axis 1 Such magnetic anisotropy stemming from strong spin-orbit coupling is believed to play an essential role in stabilizing long-range magnetic order in the 2D limit 1 1 In previous work it was found that the Fe concentration in the system is subject to the crystal synthesis methods While Fe3-xGeTe2 with x  0 is successfully grown via chemical transport method 1 crystals prepared with flux method tend to have reduced Fe site occupancy where x  0 131 A reduced Fe concentration not only results in a reduction of magnetic anisotropy but also introduces strong magnetic disorder leading to a lower Curie temperature 131 Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Fe275GeTe2 synthesized from flux method mapped out the spin excitations spectrum and found a spin gap of 37 meV at  point providing information of the magnetic exchange interactions and anisotropy 1 However because of the Fe deficiency and the corresponding disorder the excitations are rather broad and damped precluding a detailed modeling of its spin Hamiltonian In addition anomalous Hall effect observed in Fe3-xGeTe2 x  036 also indicates the defects on the Fe site and magnetic disorder 1 To overcome the Fe site deficiency we manage to obtain high-quality single crystals of Fe3GeTe2 Fig 1 through chemical vapor transport method 1 Figure 2 shows the corresponding temperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility Using the modified Curie-Weiss law to fit the data in the high-temperature range 5 is determined to be 227 K consistent with the result of ref 1 Proposed Experiment Here we propose to perform inelastic neutron scattering to investigate how the spin-wave stiffness and anisotropy gap in Fe3GeTe2 evolve as the temperature is raised across Curie temperature Single crystals of Fe3GeTe2 are grown with chemical vapor transport method using I2 as the transport agent 1 The grown crystal is typically 3 mm by 2 mm in area as show in Fig 1 and weighs about 15 mg We have grown 500 mg of the sample and will co-align the crystals in the H K  and H 0  scattering planes using X-ray Laue method We plan to use 585V  10 meV as incident energy and measure spin excitations around the  point and along 5 direction at 5 K 80 K 160 K 200 K 210 K 220 K and 5G56 Assuming each temperature takes 1 day we request 7 days of beam time at MACS to perform our proposed experiments to study this system and compare the outcome with our previous work on pure CrI3 9 1 Reference  B Huang et al Nature 546 270 2017  C Gong et al Nature 546 265 2017  Z Fei et al
