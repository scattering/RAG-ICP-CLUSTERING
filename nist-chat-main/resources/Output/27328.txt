 1Influence of Osmotic Pressure on Phospholipid Dynamics and Rhodopsin Function Specific Aims Our preliminary data suggest that membrane lipids and hydration are directly involved in rhodopsin activation However this phenomenon is not well understood In order to distinguish the effects of hydration and membrane lipid properties on rhodopsin activation from synergistic effects including the influence of hydration on membrane fluctuations neutron spin echo NSE experiments are proposed to understand 1 How the membrane phospholipid dynamics are influenced by hydration and osmotic pressure in the absence of rhodopsin 2 How phospholipid dynamics are governed by both osmotic pressure and rhodopsin To pursue these aims NSE spectroscopy will be used to assess how membrane bending fluctuations and elastic parameters are controlled by hydration using inert polymer osmolytes and by inclusion of visual rhodopsin 1 Scientific Case General Background G-protein-coupled receptors GPCRs are essential cellular signal transducers which transmit signals across biological membranes through the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins 1 The contribution of GPCR signaling to the progression of many human diseases makes them attractive pharmaceutical targets Structural characterization of GPCRs using X-ray crystallography cryo-electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy has played an important role in our understanding of GPCR activation Nonetheless these techniques often ignore effects of the surrounding membrane on GPCR activation and signaling  To address this shortcoming we aim to investigate the effects of protein environment membrane lipids and water on the activation and signaling of the GPCR archetype rhodopsin which is responsible for visual signaling Light Activation of the Visual Protein Rhodopsin Photon absorption by rhodopsin triggers a cis-trans isomerization of the bound retinal ligand causing a series of conformational adjustments within the receptor and culminating in a dynamic metarhodopsin-I meta-I inactive to metarhodopsin-II meta-II active equilibrium Fig 1 The transition from meta-I to meta-II involves the extension of transmembrane helix H5 and the outward tilt of transmembrane helix H6 exposing a hydrophilic cleft to which the transducin G-protein can bind Membrane lipid properties such as thickness and curvature are known to influence the activation of rhodopsin as explained by the Flexible Surface Model FSM  We have demonstrated that increased membrane thickness as well as negative spontaneous membrane curvature favor the meta-II conformation by reducing the energy barrier for the meta-I to meta-II transition 5 The discovery that rhodopsin activation is governed by membrane lipid properties has illuminated the need to understand the contribution of other aspects of the receptor environment such as bulk water and corresponding membrane fluctuations to rhodopsin functionRole of Water in Rhodopsin Activation We hypothesize that bulk water modulates the function of rhodopsin through both direct and indirect mechanisms  directly through changes in hydration volume that couple to the receptors activation and indirectly through hydration-driven changes in lipid dynamics and membrane properties Our previous experiments using osmotic stress techniques and molecular dynamics MD simulations consistently indicate that rhodopsin activation is coupled to a volumetric expansion and influx of bulk water into the protein 1- These large-scale protein transformations should translate into membrane undulations and localized increases in bilayer thickness At the same time we have found using solid-state NMR that increasing the available bulk water decreases bilayer thickness and may have competing effects on membrane undulations Hence more work is required to understand the complex interactions between protein-hydration and lipid-hydration effects on native rod outer segment ROS membrane fluctuations which should collectively modulate Fig1Aninfluxofmobilewaterintotheproteincoreof rhodopsin is due to light activation Moleculardynamics MD simulations of

between hydration membrane fluctuations and rhodopsin conformational dynamics will provide novel insights into the fundamental biophysical mechanisms involved in GPCR activation 2 Preliminary Experiments We have investigated the role of water in rhodopsin activation using osmotic stress techniques applied to rhodopsin in its native lipid environment as well as recombined into vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine POPC Rhodopsin was exposed to polymer osmolytes of various molecular weights and the meta-rhodopsin equilibrium was quantified using UV-visible spectrophotometry Our results indicate that dehydration of the rhodopsin interior by large molecular weight osmolytes favors the inactive meta-I conformation Preliminary data have moreover revealed a universal osmolyte response curve Fig 2 from which we determined that approximately 80 water molecules flood the rhodopsin interior upon activation These results indicate that the rhodopsin catalytic cycle occurs through a sponge-like mechanism 2 By incorporating neutron spin-echo techniques into our osmotic stress experiments we intend to gain novel insights into how lipid membrane dynamics are coupled to rhodopsin internal hydration and activation These experiments will unravel the process by which GPCRs lipids and water act synergistically to respond appropriately to cellular stimuli in the signaling process Previous small-angle neutron scattering SANS studies Fig 3 have also demonstrated the ability to monitor volumetric changes in rhodopsin molecules solubilized in detergents upon light activation  These experiments revealed that light-activation is coupled to an increase in rhodopsin volume and that changes in volumetric protein shape are coupled to the aqueous solvent Taken together with our osmotic stress data current results suggest that rhodopsin becomes swollen by the penetration of water into the protein core upon light activation However how this couples to membrane fluctuations under different osmotic stress conditions is unknown Neutron Spin-Echo NSE studies Prior NSE measurements performed by members of this team Ashkar Lab have clearly demonstrated the powerful use of NSE in directly accessing collective bending and thickness fluctuations in phospholipid membranes 7 The significance of NSE signals and their interpretation were augmented by ultra-coarse-grained MD simulations of cognate membranes  Recent studies on membrane fluctuations in response to conformational changes of membrane proteins to be submitted highlight the dynamic interaction between proteins and their lipid membrane environment In this proposal we will focus on membrane bending fluctuations under the same conditions of previous experiments on the activation state of rhodopsin as discussed above to understand the role of membrane dynamics in mediating the functional state of rhodopsin Fig3Light-induced changesof rhodopsinarerevealedbyGuinier analysis of

accessing the length and time scales of bending fluctuations and in directly accessing the elastic parameters through the Zilman-Granek q3-dependence of relaxation rates NSE provides the necessary q-range for probing rapid membrane fluctuations over length scales typical for small unilamellar vesicles which is the system of choice in this proposal Members of our team have effectively used the CHRNS-NSE spectrometer in earlier measurements of bending fluctuations on lipid vesicles and we anticipate a similar use of the instrument in this proposal Complementary SANS structural measurements are to be conducted on vSANS or the NG7-SANS instrument granted this proposal is accepted Proposed Experiments We will investigate vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine POPC both with and without rhodopsin In addition we will investigate native rod outer segment ROS membranes containing rhodopsin as the major protein component For each of the samples POPC plusminus rhodopsin and native ROS membranes we will expose the vesicles to deuterated buffered solutions containing three different concentrations of the PEG 400 osmolyte 0 10 and 30 wt  Identical experiments will be conducted using POPC vesicles and native rod outer segment ROS membranes Sample composition is summarized in Table 1 Samples will be loaded in 1 mm NSE cells available at NCNR A q-range of 004 to 015 -1 will be accessed where each protiated vesicle sample in D2O buffer would require 12 hours for reasonable statistics given the reduced contrast expected with increased PEG content Proposed NSE Beam Time Allocation With the sample set proposed here 3 PEG concentrations conducted with POPC with and without rhodopsin and native ROS membranes  12 samples and 1-2 days of resolution and background measurements we request 7-8 days of NSE beam time and 1 day of complementary beam time on vSANS or NG7-SANS for structural characterization  1hrsample at two contrast conditions References
