 Determining the Influence of Salts on Lipid Membranes Structural Properties Scientific Importance Determining the structure of lipid bilayers is crucial for understanding how natural membranes function Structural parameters including area per lipid AL and bilayer thickness DB are vital to experimentalists and theorists for predicting how different lipids influence membrane structure1 and to computational scientists for tuning force fields and validating molecular dynamics MD simulations of lipid bilayers2-4 The widely-recognized gold standard method for obtaining lipid structural information developed by Kuerka and others involves a joint analysis of SANS and SAXS data using the Scattering Density Profile SDP model With this methodology structural parameters have now been determined for many types of lipids with different headgroup and chain composition5 Because of their simplified morphology extruded unilamellar vesicles suspended in pure water are by far the most common type of sample for membrane structural studies Indeed obtaining useful scattering data for lipids in salt solutions is challenging Many commonly used lipids suffer from extensive multilamellarity when hydrated in salt-containing buffers even after extrusion through porous filters Fig 1 Neutral lipids are especially problematic due to a lack of repulsive electrostatic interactions between headgroups that strongly favors the production of unilamellar vesicles in charged membranes a problem that is further exacerbated by the screening effects of salt ions Fig 1 The presence of multilamellar vesicles MLVs contributes a structure factor to scattering data that complicates their analysis For this reason Kuerka and co-workers optimized sample preparation conditions to maximize unilamellarity by completely avoiding salt or buffers Of course the solutions that bathe cellular membranes contain a variety of ions including Na K Mg2 Ca2 and Cl- Previous studies have shown that both the structure and dynamics of phosphatidylcholine PC lipid bilayers are affected by some of these ions For example MD simulations of POPC and DPPC bilayers found decreased AL in the presence of NaCl and KCl compared to pure water6-8 A combination of experimental and computational data found a decrease in lipid lateral diffusion in POPC membranes in the presence of NaCl6 These studies suggest that structural parameters obtained for lipids in pure water which include the vast majority of such values in the literature may not accurately reflect values under physiological conditions Previous Experiments and Results We recently showed that scattering data from extruded liposomes containing residual MLVs can nevertheless be accurately modeled provided an appropriate structure factor is used Fig 19 We now propose to collect SANS data for PC bilayers in physiologically relevant salt solutions SANS from protiated lipid vesicles in D2O is especially sensitive to the bilayer thickness10 Combining these data with SAXS data from the same samples will enable a joint SDP analysis in order to obtain high quality structural information that can be directly compared to published Figure 1 Upper SAXS of unextruded POPC MLVs blue circles and POPC hydrated in PBS buffer and extruded through 100 nm pores orange diamonds Curves are fit to a model that accounts for both the bilayer form factor and the interlamellar structure factor which gives rise to Bragg reflections that appear as regularly spaced peaks arrows Lower the fraction of externally accessible lipid facc is related to the average number of lamellae with facc  05 corresponding to a perfectly unilamellar sample Salt decreases the fraction of unilamellar vesicles while charged lipid increases it Figure reproduced from Ref 9 SDP data for PC lipids to determine the influence of salt on membrane structure Proposed Experiment We propose to use SANS to determine the transverse structure of 100 nm diameter liposomes composed of commonly used phosphatidylcholine lipids eg DLPC DMPC DPPC DSPC POPC DOPC and SOPC as a function of salt concentration and temperature Bilayers will be prepared by hydrating lipid films in 0 50 and 150 mM D2O salt solutions Both NaCl and KCl will be examined Data for fluid-phase bilayers will be collected at 20C 30C 40C and 50C for the low-melting lipids DLPC POPC DOPC and SOPC For high-melting lipids data will be collected at a few temperatures above the lipids main transition temperature TM  24C 42C and 55C for DMPC DPPC and DSPC respectively Small-angle X-ray scattering data for the same samples and temperatures will be collected using ORNLs BioSAXS instrument The SANS and SAXS curves will be jointly analyzed using a matter density-based SDP model for the transverse scattering length density profiles from which leaflet structural properties will be extracted11-13 Complementary differential scanning calorimetry data and densitometry measurements on the same samples will provide an independent determination of the phase behavior and lipid volume of the samples and thus provide constraints for modeling the scattering data Allowing  30 minutes of data collection for each of the 132 conditions described above we request three days of beam time on the NGB-30-meter SANS instrument which allows acquisition of the necessary q-range  0001-05 -1 in a single instrument configuration using the standard SANS configuration neutron wavelength of 60  and SDD of 1m 4 m and 13 m There are no special safety considerations all materials are non-toxic Publications and Impact Our group has expertise in the collection and analysis of small-angle scattering data We have an extensive publication record for not only determining both AL and membrane thickness for a variety of lipid species but also developing models to accurately fit small-angle scattering data and extract those parameters2 9-13 The proposed experiments will provide valuable information about the influence of physiological salts on the structural properties of lipid membranes References 1 Lingwood D and Simons K 2010 Science 327 46 2 Marsh D 2009 Biochim Biophys Acta 1788
