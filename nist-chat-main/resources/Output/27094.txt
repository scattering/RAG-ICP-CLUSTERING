 Dynamics of high-performance reinforced thermoplastics Kapil Surve Anil Bhowmick Ramanan Krishnamoorti University of Houston 1 Research Objectives Polyetheretherketone PEEK is a thermoplastic extensively used across oil and gas automobile and aerospace When exposed to extreme conditions such as high pressure and high temperature PEEK excels in retaining its properties These include mechanical modulus and thermal properties however PEEK begins to fail with prolonged exposure at temperatures in excess of 350oC To enhance the range of temperature over which PEEK maintains its properties dispersion of nanoparticles such as graphene and carbon nanotubes CNTs in PEEK nanocomposites is considered The inclusion of such nanoparticles is anticipated to impact chain dynamics in the PEEK matrix with PEEK-particle interaction playing an important role Therefore it is crucial to study PEEK-nanoparticle interactions occurring at the interface It is also important to understand if the aromatic portions or the aliphatic portion of PEEK has preferential interactions with the added nanoparticles We propose to use inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering INS and QENS respectively to understand the impact of added nanoparticles on segmental dynamics in this important engineering polymer QENS would equip us to estimate the primary  segmental relaxation times for the chains as well as study the local motions of hydrogen atoms Specifically previous work has indicated that the dynamics of PEEK are best described using a jump diffusion model Observing the relaxation distribution and diffusion coefficients distribution with changing temperature will provide information about the effect of reinforcements like graphene and CNT We focus here on the impact of dispersed nanoparticles on the chain dynamics of PEEK at temperatures ranging from below Tg to above melting point of the polymer 2 Background The incoherent-scattering cross section for Hydrogen is much larger when compared with those of other atoms like Carbon Oxygen etc and therefore Hydrogen dominates the incoherent scattering spectrum for PEEK 87 In a previous research pure PEEK has been studied with QENS and dielectric spectroscopy QENS was focused on protons bonded to the aromatic rings while dielectric experiments provided information about dipole moments of the rings ketone and ether groups QENS helps determine how aromatic rings affect  relaxation with the elastic-incoherent-scattering-function EISF and half-width at half-maximum HWHM of the Lorentzian function  have been used for extracting dynamics information including the fraction of mobile protons nT These measurements point to a molecular motion consisting of elastic and quasielastic components At TTg the amorphous phase dynamics can be visualized as occurring in a region surrounded and restricted by crystalline regions In Figure 1 EISF and HWHM  are plotted as functions of Q at T177oC The elastic component given by EISF values is dependent on both temperature and Q which points towards a restricted geometry and presence of order Specifically at low Q values large-range characteristics of the relaxation motion are seen Segmental dynamics in the form of chain relaxation was modelled using a jump-diffusion process occurring in a restricted volume FEISF is fit to the experimental data to obtain the values for length dimension of the number of mobile protons nT and restricted volume L In Figure 2 the increase of nT with temperature points to a gradual mobilization of initially immobilized protons In complementary measurements the dielectric strength  was measured Both  and nT help us in obtaining the number of mobile entities and the temperature-influenced shift from fractional immobility to relaxation The changes in the restricted volume L with temperature indicates that the motion is of both rotational and translational nature However the impact of reinforcement on the dynamics parameters is yet unexplored Addition of graphene  could be viewed as addition of a lamellar object that may depending on volume fraction and alignment present a fresh barrier to the chains which could decrease the dynamics However its also possible that graphene lamellar sheets align with crystalline portions of PEEK in which case the constrained amorphous phase would not be affected leaving the dynamics same as before MWCNT which is cylindrical in nature and has lesser surface area than graphene cannot form a direct barrier for moving chains even though it may still affect chain movement Addition of MWCNT  is expected to offer less restriction to chain relaxation than graphene Therefore we wish to contrast the impact of cylindrical nanotubes to lamellar graphene sheets ie do they function as synergistic additives or do they impose a fresh set of constraints independent of the crystalline regions Figure 1 aEISF  b as a function of Q at 227oCO 277oC 327oC

shaped samples of PEEK Victrex grade 450G and derived nanocomposites would be prepared in aluminum holders with sample thickness below 01mm to avoid multiple scattering Nanoparticles such as multi-wall CNT single-wall CNT unfunctionalized graphene would be blended with PEEK Similar-sized samples would be studied beforehand using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy The volume fraction of nanoparticles would be kept at 0 10 20  40 High Flux Backscattering spectrometer HFBS would be utilized with incident Neutron wavelength   627 and Q-range as 04-1  Q  20-1 Data collected would be in the form of QENS profile of dynamic scattering function SQw within the Q-range given at five different temperatures ranging from below Tg to above Tm Each HFBS experiment would take around 24hrsample and we have 9 samples PEEK PEEK with SWCNT at 10 20  40 with MWCNT at 20  40 with graphene at 10 20  40 Considering the background and resolution experiments our requirement is of 10 days of beamtime
