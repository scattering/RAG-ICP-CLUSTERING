Measuring the bending rigidity of an asymmetric bilayer with Neutron Spin Echo Scientific Background Membrane curvature is ubiquitous in living organisms Fig 1A and an accurate determination of the elastic constants that describe membrane deformation Fig 1D is crucial for understanding many biological phenomena In particular the bending modulus kc determines the magnitude of thermally-driven bending fluctuations that mediate membrane-membrane interactions and influence the insertion and activity of membrane-associated enzymes and transmembrane proteins  Many important classes of proteins induce bending in membranes and an accurate determination of kc is necessary for understanding their behavior  While kc has been measured in symmetric liposomes for a variety of lipids  biological membranes present the additional complication of transbilayer compositional asymmetry Fig 1B For example the mammalian plasma membrane actively sequesters nearly all of its high-melting lipids in the outer leaflet while the negatively charged and low melting lipids are preferentially segregated within the inner leaflet Fig 1C  Differences in composition likely result in significant differences in the structural and mechanical properties of the two leaflets indeed the ability to independently measure kc of each leaflet would in principle provide information about interleaflet coupling strength However such data are lacking due both to the difficulty of preparing asymmetric model bilayers and the inability of most techniques to isolate signal from the individual leaflets Neutron scattering is a valuable tool for studying membranes due to the large range of neutron scattering length density NSLD contrasts that can be achieved by varying the hydrogendeuterium ratios of both solvent and lipid In particular scattering from individual leaflets of an asymmetric bilayer can be suppressed through the use of contrast matching allowing the measurement of leaflet structure and mechanical properties Among existing techniques for measuring kc neutron spin echo NSE possesses a unique ability to resolve the contributions of the individual leaflets Figure 1 Curvature and asymmetry in biological membranes A Eukaryotic cells possess highly curved internal membranes B The plasma membrane surrounding the cell exhibits compositional asymmetry ie different lipids in the inner and outer leaflets C Distribution of major lipid components of the PM between the inner cytosolic and outer exoplasmic leaflets sphingomyelin SM phosphatidylcholine PC phosphatidylserine PS and phosphatidylethanolamine PE D Elastic membrane deformations In the first of a multipart experiment we propose to measure kc of each leaflet of an asymmetric liposome While such measurements are possible they are technically demanding and to our knowledge have not been previously attempted As a first step we will demonstrate proof-of-principle by preparing and measuring kc of isotopically asymmetric large unilamellar vesicles aLUVs composed of POPC and its deuterated variants If successful we will use the techniques developed here to measure kc of chemically asymmetric LUVs mimicking the plasma membrane composition The proposed experiments are first-of-their-kind and will have far-reaching impact Previous Results We recently developed a novel technique for preparing tensionless solvent-free aLUVs suitable for biophysical studies  Briefly symmetric acceptor LUVs of the desired inner leaflet composition are incubated with donor multilamellar vesicles MLVs of the desired outer leaflet composition in the presence of the lipid carrier molecule methyl-beta-cyclodextrin CD CD acts as a catalyst exchanging donor lipid into the LUV outer leaflet Residual donor MLVs are then removed by centrifugation and cyclodextrin is removed by filtration Leaflet composition and structure can be characterized using isotopic labeling strategies thereby avoiding the use of bulky and potentially perturbing labels For example NMR and gas chromatography allow a precise quantification of the extent of lipid exchange and asymmetry while small-angle neutron or X-ray scattering can resolve bilayer structural features with sub-nanometer resolution Isotopically asymmetric POPC vesicles prepared using this method were found to have the same bilayer thickness and area per lipid as symmetric POPC vesicles demonstrating that the modified exchange protocol preserves native bilayer structure  Moreover POPC aLUVs retain  90 of their initial asymmetry after 24 hours at T  50C Fig 2F

Predicted SANS curves for full contrast and matched leaflet samples corresponding to the NSLD profiles in A-C F Loss of asymmetry vs time for POPC asymmetric LUVs at various temperatures measured with 1H NMR as described in ref 4 Aims of Proposed Experiments and Estimate of Beamtime We propose to use NSE to independently measure the bending rigidity of the inner and outer leaflets of 100 nm diameter POPC vesicles prepared at a concentration of 50 mgml Fig 2 Isotopically asymmetric LUVs will be employed in order to match the NSLD of either the inner or outer leaflet to that of the surrounding solvent Fig 2A-C thereby isolating signal from the individual leaflets Selective leaflet deuteration will be achieved using a well-established cyclodextrin-mediated lipid exchange procedure  To achieve contrast matching at high D2O fractions we will use two isotopic variants of POPC Fig 2D both of which will be synthesized in-house POPC-d13 having a partially deuterated headgroup and POPC-d77 having two perdeuterated chains in addition to the partially deuterated headgroup At an 8515 ratio of POPC-d77POPC-d13 the leaflets headgroup and hydrocarbon regions are matched to 93 D2O solvent A total of three samples full contrast inner matched and outer matched will each be measured at 25 35 and 45C in order to determine the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity we note that POPC aLUVs retain  90 of their initial asymmetry up to at least 24 hours when incubated at temperatures less than 50C Fig 2F Samples will be loaded in 2 mm NSE cells available at NCNR 6  and 8  neutrons will be employed to access a q range from 005-02 -1 where bending fluctuations are most reliably measured  For the full contrast sample the NSE instrument will be tuned to a q range of  005-015 -1 where the upper limit corresponds to the first minimum in the SANS signal that is related to the bilayer thickness Fig 2E solid line For the inner and outer matched samples the decrease in the apparent bilayer thickness will shift the minimum to q  025 -1 Fig 2E dashed line in this case the measurements will be performed over a q range of  01-02 -1 NSE data will be analyzed using the Zilman-Granek theory for membrane fluctuations following previous studies by Nagao et al  We expect that the full contrast matched samples will require  5 hours per condition The inner matched and outer matched samples will require a 4-fold longer data collection time 20 hrs per sample since nearly half of the membrane will be contrast matched For three samples at three temperatures each in addition to background and resolution measurements  1 day each we request 8 days of beam time For complementary structural characterization of the samples we request 12 hours of SANS beam time 1 hr per sample per temperature for the full q range including lens configuration preferably prior to or at the start of the allocated NSE beam time References 1 Marsh D Chem Phys Lipids 144146-159 2006 2
