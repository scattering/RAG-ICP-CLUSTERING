Magnetic Interactions in Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 Introduction Recently it has been shown that the double perovskite compounds Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 might be an ideal realization of the two-dimensional spin-12 square-lattice J1-J2 model1- As shown in Figure 1 AB the magnetic Cu2 ions are mainly coupled in two paths nearest neighbor Cu2 interact through the 90 Cu-O-TeW-O-Cu exchange pathway antiferromagnetic J1 and next-nearest neighbor Cu2 are interacted through the 180 Cu-O-TeW-O-Cu exchange pathway antiferromagnetic J22 In the x  1 case due to the significant W6 5d0-O2- 2p hybridization J2 exchange is enhanced and becomes dominant which is not possible with 4d10 Te6 ions2 Therefore tuning W6 concentration x will change the magnitude of antiferromagnetic J1 and J2 affecting the magnetic ground states and excitations of the system For the x  0 case the dominating antiferromagnetic J1 J2J1  05 leads to Nel order Fig 2 B on the contrary for x  1 the dominating J2 J2J1  05 favors columnar order Fig2 D A recent muon spin-relaxation study on the x  05 compound Sr2CuTe05W05O6 showed a possible existence of a quantum spin liquid state that can be realized with J2J1  05 The phase diagram of Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 is shown in Fig 1 C At the two end points x  0 and 1 the system orders In the middle however there is a wide range of x where the system is magnetically disordered We would like to systematically study how the magnetic interactions evolve in Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 as a function of x and the nature of the magnetic interactions in the magnetically disordered region especially x05 Proposed research Our group has performed time-of-flight neutron scattering measurements on the x05 system Sr2CuTe05W05O6 to investigate the nature of magnetic interactions and the disordered ground state of this spin liquid candidate The powder measurements were done at 15 K and 40 K with Fig 1 Crystal structure  AB and phase diagram  C of Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 Fig 2 Elastic neutron diffraction data A C and corresponding magnetic structures B D for Sr2CuTeO6  Sr2CuWO6  an incident energy Ei  332 meV at CNCS ORNL As shown in Figure 3 AB some broad inelastic magnetic signals are observed The magnetic signal is greatly manifested after subtracting the high-temperature 40 K data Fig 3B In order to observe the details of this magnetic scattering with higher resolution and to determine if any magnetic ordering occurs at lower temperatures we measured the same sample at 15 K and 006 K with an incident energy Ei  227 meV at DCS in a limited beamtime window 24 hrs total very recently To our surprise we do not observe any prominent magnetic signal in either the elastic or the inelastic spectra as shown in Figure 3 CD We suspect that the rather low neutron flux at DCS is not sufficient to detect the weak magnetic signal from background that is about 300 times lower intensity than the Bragg peaks at  15 -1 from the CNCS measurement This calls for further systematic neutron experiments on Sr2CuTe05W05O6 using a spectrometer with much larger flux and low temperature sample environment dilution refrigerator In the proposed research we would like to perform high flux measurements on Sr2CuTe05W05O6 on MACS at NCNR that can cover this energy and Q range with the required resolution The much higher flux and low temperature 100 mK sample environment are necessary to resolve the experimental paradox Based on our previous experience to obtain good statistics we request at least 6 days of MACS beamtime to measure the low-temperature 006 K and 15 K and a high-temperature  40 K data The powder sample will be sealed in a copper Fig 1 Inelastic neutron scattering INS spectra of Sr2CuTe05W05O6 measured at CNCS A 15 K B background subtraction 15 K - 40 K INS spectra of Sr2CuTe05W05O6 measured at DCS done very recently C 15 K D 006 K can under 10 bar helium as was done for the DCS measurement The better signal to background statistics expected on MACS will give us new information about the lowest temperature magnetic ground state and resolve inelastic features seen on CNCS References  Xu Y et al Comparative description of magnetic interactions in Sr2CuTeO6 and Sr2CuWO6 J Phys Condens Matter 29 105801 2017  Mustonen O et al Tuning the S12 square-lattice antiferromagnet Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 from Neel order to quantum disorder to columnar order Phys Rev B 98 064411 2018  Watanabe M et al Valence-bond-glass state with a singlet gap in the spin-12 square-lattice random J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet Sr2CuTe1-xWxO6 Phys Rev B 98 054422 2018  Mustonen O et al Spin-liquid-like state in a spin-12 square-lattice antiferromagnet perovskite induced by d10 -
