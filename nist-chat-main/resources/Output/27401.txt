Background Polyelectrolytes are polymers with charged groups along their backbone that lead to a wide range of structural and functional properties4 Despite their prevalence in health care and biotechnological applications the dynamic behavior of polyelectrolytes remains poorly understood due to the interplay of many competing variables such as charge density counter ion binding and the ionic strength of the environment In controlled drug release polyelectrolytes are used as ultrathin coating for controlled drug release applications In such applications the dynamics of polyelectrolyte films dictate the diffusion rate of the drug into the target cell1 Due to electrostatic repulsion of the counterions on the backbone polyelectrolytes exhibit a unique stretched rod-like conformation with a theoretical Flory exponent of one This extended conformation results in concentration-independent dynamics in contrast with Gaussian chains in the semidilute regime The addition of salt into polyelectrolyte solutions introduces charge screening which in return increases the excluded volume effects making the chains adopt a collapsed Gaussian conformation Although there has been a significant amount of work done on the linear viscoelastic scaling behavior of polyelectrolytes2 and bulk rheology measurements on polyelectrolyte solutions at low and high salt limits3 the effect of salt on the segmental dynamics of charged polymer chains is still poorly understood An improved understanding of polyelectrolyte dynamics will allow us to control their transport in complex media Previous Work The properties of polyelectrolytes in solutions depend on multiple parameters including fraction of dissociated ion groups solution dielectric constant salt concentration and solvent quality for polymer backbone Recently a coupling theory by Cai and Rubinstein proposed that nanoparticle dynamics in polymer solutions are controlled by the fluctuations of segmental relaxations of polymer chains6 The particle dynamics were then collapsed as a function of the ratio of particle to polymer size Our group verified that this physical picture holds for fully flexible polymers7 Since polyelectrolytes exhibit different properties than Gaussian chains we wanted to investigate how polyelectrolytes affect the transport properties of nanoparticles To test the effects of non-ideal chains we probed polystyrene nanoparticle dynamics ranging from 100 to 790 nm in sodium polystyrene sulfonate Rg  188 nm Mw  2200 kDa dissolved in deionized water as a function of ionic strength At a given polyelectrolyte concentration solution viscosity is significantly perturbed by salt concentration as seen in Figure 1 and its scaling behavior is different than gaussian chains The scaling behavior of polyelectrolyte solutions significantly changes as a function of salt going from rigid-rod to Figure 1 Sodium polystyrene sulfonate specific viscosity sp as a function of scaled polymer concentration cc in deionized water solutions at three different sodium chloride concentrations Solid lines represent theoretical scaling at low and high salt limits random coil conformation predictions as salt concentration increases The change of bulk viscosity scaling as a function of salt concentration suggests that segmental relaxations of polyelectrolytes change at different ionic strength This hypothesis stems from the fact that bulk viscosity of polymer solutions is a result of the hierarchical segmental relaxations of chains across the sample To quantify the effect of these changes in polymer dynamics on particle transport we determine nanoparticle dynamics using optical microscopy The particle dynamics depend on particle size and salt concentration as shown in Figure 2 In the low salt limit nanoparticle dynamics do not collapse according to the length scales provided by the coupling theory derived for Gaussian chains suggesting that the coupling between nanoparticles and polymer segmental relaxations are markedly different in polyelectrolyte solutions At low salt limit the dynamics deviate from bulk predictions at intermediate concentrations before returning to bulk behavior at higher concentration As salt concentration increases nanoparticle dynamics start following bulk behavior across all polyelectrolyte concentrations These results suggest the emergence of a coupling mechanism between particles and polyelectrolyte chains which is different from that with neutral polymers This finding leads us to hypothesize that the particles are coupling to changes in the segmental relaxations of polyelectrolytes Thus developing a clear understanding of the segmental relaxations of polyelectrolytes is critical to predicting transport properties Figure 2 Polystyrene nanoparticle diffusivity scaled to Stokes-Einstein predictions DDSE as a function of scaled polymer concentration cc at Left 0M NaCl and Right 10-3M NaCl Proposed Research Approach and Expected Results Based on our experiments we hypothesize that the segmental relaxation behavior of polyelectrolytes will significantly change with salt concentration Assuming a transition from the limit of rigid-rod to random coil conformation we expect the relaxation time to be inversely proportional to salt concentration The chain motion will not follow the standard Zimm model that describes the dynamics of gaussian chains within their correlation volume To investigate this hypothesis we propose to run neutron spin echo NSE experiments on sodium polystyrene sulfonate Rg  188 nm Mw  2200 kDa dissolved in solutions of deuterium oxide The difference in scattering length densities SLD of sodium polystyrene sulfonate NaPSS SLD  1140 and deuterium oxide SLD  6393 will provide enough contrast to isolate the resulting scattering signal only from polyelectrolyte chains In previous work with similar SLD differences we verified that 10 polymer volume fraction per sample ensures accurate measurements of polymer segmental motions10 In polyelectrolytes the enormous osmotic pressure in polyelectrolyte solutions caused by counterion entropy does not allow the correlation volumes to overlap resulting in a peak in the scattering function The position of this peak is equivalent to the inverse of correlation length according to the relationship Q  2 Characterizing the correlation length will provide us with the polymer length scales necessary for mapping the particle dynamics according to the coupling theory These measurements will need to be done using small angle neutron scattering SANS and will compliment NSE measurements of polyelectrolyte solutions Zimm dynamics occur across correlation blob length scales Relaxation times extracted from coherent scattering of polymer solutions represent a wide-range of length scales Large length scales represent with polymer mesh motion whereas short length scales depict the segmental motion The crossover length scale from collective diffusion of a polymer mesh to Zimm mode segmental monomer dynamics can be estimated as Q  3lp where lp is the persistence length For our polyelectrolyte system the crossover will shift from 002 to 030 -1 as salt concentration increases We predict that relaxation rates will scale diffusively   Q2 below the crossover whereas the Zimm mode will showcase a greater dependence on length scale   Q2 The time scales associated with segmental motion are on the order of 1-100 ns NSE is the only available technique that allows us to measure dynamics at the appropriate length and time scales for polymer segments The proposed NSE and SANS measurements will thus elucidate the structure and dynamics of polyelectrolyte chains in the presence of salt lead to a rapid publication and will be of great interest to the growing polymers community Experimentally we propose to measure the dynamics of 12 different solutions To measure all the samples we ask for a total NSE beam time of 14 days The samples will span three salt concentrations and four different polymer concentrations at a single molecular weight 2200 kDa Salt concentrations will be between 10-5 and 10-1 M whereas polymer concentrations will range from 3c to 10c relative to the overlap concentration of 2200 kDa sodium polystyrene sulfonate The polymer concentrations will span the region where particle dynamics deviate from bulk behavior We will need to measure the scattering intensity profile for all the samples using SANS To generate the full scattering curve we will need to capture the scattering intensity at 1 m 4 m and 13 m configurations for 30 min 20 min and 15 min respective resulting in a total required SANS beam time of 1 day References 1 Berg C M Zhai L Cohen R E Rubner M F
