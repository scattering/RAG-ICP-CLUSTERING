1 Investigating Shale Nanopore Structures Using Contrast-Matching Small-Angle and Ultra-Small-Angle Neutron Scattering CW Neil H Xu and RP Hjelm Los Alamos National Laboratory Background and Significance Shale oilgas production in the US has increased exponentially from virtually nonexistent in late 1990s to about half of the current domestic oilgas production with the projection of continued growth in the future  However hydrocarbon recovery rates using existing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing methods are extremely low  10 for oil and about 20 for gas  due to the small porosity a few to a few hundred nm and low permeability 10-16-10-20 m2 of tight shale formations  Fundamental scientific questions remain about the relationship between shale nanopore structures and the behavior of included hydrocarbon fluids Current Status Shale nanopores are intrinsically heterogeneous and occur in both organic eg kerogen and inorganic eg clay rich components of shale matrices The proportion and size distribution of open and closed nanopores in each component largely determines the permea-bility of a fracture-free shale matrix To better estimate the oilgas content it is important to characterize the heterogeneous nanopores of shale matrices where hydrocarbons are stored Moreover because of nanoscale confinement effects the fluid properties such as bubble and dew point pressures of hydrocarbons in nanopores can be significantly modified Such under-standing is critical for determining the effective permeability of tight rocks assessing the po-tential for multiphase flow and optimizing operational parameters to maximize hydrocarbon recovery Common techniques for shale nanopore characterization including mercury porosimetry and gas sorption are limited to measuring open pores that are larger than the probe molecule Alt-hough TEM can resolve features at nanoscales  sample preparation frequently induces arti-facts As a result most current knowledge of fluid behavior in shale nanopores has been ob-tained from computer simulations  with limited experimental data available Objectives The overarching goal of our shale program is to gain a fundamental understanding of shale nanopore structures their interactions with methane gas water frac fluid and hydro-carbon fluids and the resulting extraction of hydrocarbon fluids using integrated experimental and modeling studies We address two aspects of shale structure that are critical to our goal 1 distinguish open pores from closed pores 6- and 2 distinguish nanopores in organic matter kerogen from those in inorganic minerals clay Kerogen nanopores account for a large por-tion of the total shale porosity and are believed to be the major host for oilgas as hydrocarbons form from the heating of kerogen In particular because the walls of these pores tend to adsorb hydrocarbon gas molecules they will likely host most of the gas formed during thermal matu-ration processes SANSUSANS is an ideal probe for fluid accessibility and hydrocarbon ex-traction at relevant length scales for shale nanopores due to neutron penetrability through robust sample environments such as pressure cells and deuteriumhydrogen contrast variation  Experimentally determined nanoscale behavior serves as the input for lattice Boltzmann simu-lation of hydrocarbon fluid behavior at reservoir conditions Previous work In the most recent NCNR run cycle we conducted SANSUSANS measure-ments designed to mimic the huff-and-puff enhanced oil recovery operations to understand the resulting access of methane gas to and removal of decaneour model hydrocarbonfrom 2 nanoscale pores of mineralogically-distinct shale specimens including carbonate-rich and car-bonate-poor samples from Wolfcamp and organic matter-rich and organic matter-poor samples from Marcellus During these experiments SANSUSANS measurements were taken of dry samples and samples imbibed with deuterated decane C10D22 SANSUSANS measurements were then carried out upon introduction of deuterated methane CD4 at increasing pressures up to 7500 psi then decreasing down to ambient Results were complemented by an additional series of measurements after reversing the components contrast by using hydrogenated decane C10H22 with deuterated methane These measurements showed a strong length scale depend-ence of contrast between large pores in the micron domain and those in the nanoscale domain Furthermore the data showed a length-scale dependent removal of decane by methane when the samples were returned to ambient pressure Proposed Experiments We plan to build on these observations by using a contrast-matching C10H22C10D22 solu-tion to better visualize the pore spaces accessible to liquid hydrocarbons and methane as well as the pores where most hydrocarbons are recovered We will conduct experiments on representative shale specimens as used in our previous work at the NG7-30m SANS and BT5 USANS beamlines accessing a wide Q range of 000005-05 -1 We will first determine the contrast matching point of the samples Shale samples will be imbibed with D2OH2O mixtures of various ratios to identify the scattering length density SLD of the shale matrix taken as the minimum in the parabolic intensity curve at the con-trast match point from the filling of open pores of the shale matrix Figure 1 Due to heteroge-neity of nanopores in shale we will also determine the effects of fluid type on contrast-matching determination We will conduct a second set of measurements using hydrogenateddeuterated decane mixtures We expect that the calculated SLD of the matrix can vary depending on the Q-range and fluid type giving us insight into the chemical nature of different pore size ranges Analysis using the two-phase solid matrixpore space approximation will yield accessible ver-sus inaccessible pore ratios for water methane and decane and shed light on the effects of min-eral compositions on shale nanopore characteristics and the mechanisms of complex nanopore-fluid interactions 6- In particular comparative measurements of organic-rich and organic-poor specimens will reveal the contributions from kerogen and inorganic minerals The proposed experiments complement our work on in-situ characterization of shale nanopore structures and confined fluid behavior at field pressure-temperature-stress conditions 1 and the obtained results will lay the basis for detailed analyses of the in-situ SANSUSANS data For the above described experiments we request 1 day at NG7-30m SANS and 3 days at BT5 USANS the latter of which requires longer data collection time Figure 1 Preliminary USANS contrast match-ing measurements for clay-rich shale Minimum intensity at SLD  3810-6 2 corresponds with a D2OH2O ratio of approximately 6634 3 References 1 a US Energy Information Administration 2017 Annual Energy Outlook with Projec-tions to 2040 wwweiagovforecastsaeo b Chaudhary AS Ehlig-Economides C
