What is the Pre-Strain in a Polymer Network Background and Motivation Polymer networks are an important category of materials with a broad range of applications ranging from common tires to biomedical materials such as tissue scaffolds and drug delivery systems Predicting the mechanical properties of networks even the relatively simple linear elasticity is a long-standing challenge with significant technological importance Recently the development of network disassembly spectroscopy NDS allowed first and second degree loops to be counted in a carefully designed chemical system consisting of bi-functional polymer strands crosslinked with tri- and tetra-function crosslinkers Loop fraction was shown to decrease as gel concentration was increased in both the tri- and tetra- functional networks as shown in Figure 1 In parallel to these efforts our group developed kinetic graph theory KGT and real elastic network theory RENT which provide near-quantitative predictions of network modulus in real defect-rich networks as shown in Figure 2 As the RENT category of theories has been further developed by us and other authors a critical uncertainty has emerged over the role of strand pre-strain in the polymer networks A common assumption in network theory is that the average end-to-end distance of a network before gelation is equal to that after gelation Pre-strain refers to the idea that some chains will be distorted from Gaussian conformations after the crosslinking process This can be described by the ratio 5  5_205A5O2 where 5_20 is the mean distance of network strands in the network and 5A5O2 is the size of the corresponding free Gaussian chain Models based on the phantom network theory developed by our group can match experimental data by assuming that pre-strain is given by ideal Gaussian chains and ideal Gaussian rings Langs group also argues for pre-strain distorting network properties from the ideal phantom network model while other authors make stronger assumptions Gusev recently used pre-strain to correct an affine-based theory to agree with experimental data if chains contract to 10-20 of their original size Therefore complete validation of these theories addressing a foundational and unresolved dispute that exists even in textbooks for introductory polymer science requires experimental testing of the pre-strain assumption We propose to measure single chain conformations in networks before and after crosslinking with varying loop fractions using small angle neutron scattering SANS We hypothesize that the effects of pre-strain should become more pronounced as gel concentration is decreased since loop fraction increases as concentration is decreased thus shrinking the average chain size SANS is ideally suited for these measurements since contrast can be obtained by deuterium labelling a fraction of the chains enabling single-chain measurements of size and conformation Quantifying the changes in conformation a single chain experiences during network formation with SANS Figure 2 Improved agreement with experimental elasticity data from tri- left and tetra-function gels right when chain pre-strain is accounted for in RENT Figure 1 Zhongs data for tetra-functional crosslinkers showing modulus and average primary loops per junction as a function of gel concentration would offer fundamental insight for network design and would improve the validity of theoretical assumptions Experimental Plan Chemical System We propose to use a system of monodisperse end-functionalized polydimethylsiloxane PDMS and deuterated PDMS dPDMS with vinyl end groups These chains will react with tetrakisdemithylsiloxysilane crosslinkers using Karstedts platinum catalyst to create a tetra-functional end-linked network as shown in Figure 3 Oligomeric dimethyl siloxanes will be used as solvent for the reaction enabling a system that is an ideal athermal mixture such that there is no need to account for interactions between solvent and polymer Monodisperse PDMS will allow the average chain size to be probed without the additional uncertainty of a distribution of chain lengths Anionic ring opening polymerizations of both hydrogenated and deuterated hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane D3 will be used to achieve a polydispersity of  11 Molecular weights of 9000 and 17000 gmol will be targeted both below the entanglement molecular weight of 27000 gmol for PDMS Previous work by Herz tested chain conformations using SANS with a PDMS system before and after crosslinking in high concentration networks ranging from neat to a volume fraction of 06 Herz reported no statistically significant change in the radius of gyration before and after gealation for the three volume fractions tested However when compared to modified RENT predictions for 5 as a function of the volume fraction of polymer as shown in Figure 3 it becomes apparent that this was to be expected Figure 3 includes the general theoretical pre-strain prediction accounting only for primary loops and the corresponding calculated data from experimentally measured loop fractions of primary and secondary loops reported by Wang using NDS The loop fraction data was converted to the expected 5 values using Figure 3 Synthetic scheme for the crosslinking of PDMS chains into a network 0405060708091110 02 04 06 08 1Volume Fraction PolymerTheoretical primary loops

is calculated from RENT theory considering only primary loops dark and light blue squares are calculated from primary and secondary loop data from Wang red circles are data reported by Herz formulas for the Rg of a ring polymer and half a ring polymer for primary and secondary loops respectively It is apparent that the concentrations of interest fall at low volume fractions which to our knowledge have never been investigated previously Proposed Experiments Six gel concentrations with different loop fractions will be prepared Concentrations will be chosen at 4 8 12 18 24 and 100 vol  polymer The lower concentrations will probe the region where the effects of pre-strain are expected while the neat sample will allow for comparison with the data reported by Herz Measurements will be taken at room temperature 25  Each concentration will have 2 samples one unreacted sol and one gel Each sample will be prepared with a dPDMSPDMS ratio targeting 50 to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio although it can be reduced to as low as 2 dPDMS and still obtain signal with  10 error if material is limited Data will be fit using a Debye function form factor for Gaussian chains Good solvent models will also be used and will likely be necessary for the low concentration samples The radius of gyration Rg of single chains will be extracted as a model fit parameter and the analyzed data will be compared to test the previously stated hypothesis Guinier analysis will also be done on all samples to obtain Rg independently of a model The extent to which the sol and gel chain size varies will then be used to calculate the pre-strain which will be input into the network theories of our own lab and other groups to improve our ability to quantitatively test these theories Beam Time Request 3 days We propose to use the NGB 30 m SANS instrument as the Q-range fits the range of interest in this experiment Previous studies on PDMS using SANS have successfully extracted fit parameters using Q ranges of 001-6 nm-1 We wish to study 2 molecular weights each at 6 concentrations and 2 samples per concentration for a total of 24 samples Assuming an average of 25 hours per sample the total amount of beam time needed is 3 days including time for measurements of standards backgrounds and sample changes This research is a critical component of the doctoral dissertation of Haley Beech and the measurements cannot be performed by X-rays or other methods SANS is the only technique capable of measuring precise changes in single chain size and conformation as required for this work References 1
