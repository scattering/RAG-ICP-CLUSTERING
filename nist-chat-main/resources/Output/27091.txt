Proximity based interactions between Nel skyrmions and superconducting vortices Patrick Quarterman Eric Fullerton and Julie Borchers Superconductorferromagnet SF heterostructures have been an area of great interest due to the novel physics that arise when superconducting Cooper pairs interact with the ferromagnetic exchange field Systems containing a stabilized skyrmion in proximity to an s-wave superconductor are strong candidates for Majorana bound states 1 Weyl points  or Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like states  Ferromagnetic skyrmions exhibit a chiral spin texture with the moments wrapping into a closed coplanar loop Figure 1a Due to their size sub 100 nm and low current density needed to move them skyrmions have gathered significant interest for use in spintronic memories GdFe multilayers have been demonstrated to contain skyrmions formed in an ordered hexagonal lattice with a hybrid NelBloch type closure domain and a diameter of approximately 200 nm  The Nel type domains form on the top and bottom of the film and a Bloch-type around the equatorial band Several theoretical works have reported on the coupling of skyrmions to superconducting vortices and conclude that the vortices may sit on the skyrmions site or anti-site depending on the geometry of the applied magnetic field via direct electromagnetic coupling Figure 1b 6 Recently Boumard et al considered a SF heterostructure where coupling between Nel type skyrmions in the ferromagnet with strong spin orbit coupling and vortices are dominated instead by proximity effects  This can be accomplished by tuning the ferromagnet such that the magnetic moment is less than the first critical field Hc1 of the superconductor by either having a small magnetization M or a thickness significantly smaller than that of the superconductor This theoretical work also predicts that the vortex coupling can be changed from site vs anti-site position by changing the direction of the applied external field Finally it was suggested that the inverse effect can occur in which a skyrmion is generated in the ferromagnet when place in proximity to a superconducting vortex Figure 1 a Schematic of SF heterostructure where the ferromagnet has a Nel skyrmions coupled to the superconductor by proximity effect  b Schematic of vortex formation caused by electromagnetic coupling to an adjacent skyrmion  SANS has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique in characterizing both skyrmions and superconducting vortex lattices In our current study Nb will serve as the type-II superconductor and Pt-doped FeGd as the ferromagnet where the Pt provides the spin orbit coupling The sample geometry will be SiTa5GdFe-Pt80Nb200Ta10 where the thicknesses are denoted in nanometers We have measured resistance as a function of field on the samples and when the Skyrmion state is set at room temperature a bump in the resistivity when cooling through the superconducting transition temperature is observed and is consistent with commensurate lattice matching An additional sample with a non-conductive oxide layer of Al2O3 separating the GdFe-Pt and Nb SIF will be used as a control sample since the oxide layer will prevent any proximity effects The experiment will be subdivided into 1 zero field measurements and 2 measurements with an applied field greater than Hc1 In each case the skyrmion lattice will be ordered by applying a field at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the film surface and then rotating the surface normal parallel to the beam as demonstrated previously for comparable FeGd superlattices prepared by the same team  In addition to the measurements below background will need to be collected and is expected to take 12 hours 1 Zero field measurements will be conducted to examine the predicted generation of a superconducting vortex in the absence of an external magnetic field The skyrmion state will be set at room temperature and confirmed by finding the 6-fold symmetry in SANS measurements Once the skyrmion state has been confirmed the samples will be measured above and below the superconducting critical temperature of Nb Tcrit  9 K Measurements above the critical temperature will serve as a background since the Nb will not contribute to the magnetic scattering If theoretical predictions are correct then the generation of a vortex lattice will be seen by a shift in intensity or symmetry of the SANS measurement depending on if the vortices are commensurate with the skyrmion lattices when cooled below the critical temperature Last measurements on the SIF sample will be carried out at the same conditions as a control since the insulating barrier will destroy any proximity coupling between the S and F layers 2 Immediately after the zero field measurements of the SF sample a field large enough to destroy the skyrmion state will be applied below the critical temperature of Nb which will also generate Figure 2 Resistance measurements as function of field when cooling near the superconducting critical temperature a vortex lattice in Nb A measurement at this condition will determine if a skyrmion state is then recreated due to proximity from the vortex lattice as is suggested by theorists The sample will then be warmed up to reset the skyrmion and vortex state at room temperature and then re-cooled At 3 K an in situ magnetic field will be applied and measurements will be taken in incremental steps of 10 mT from zero field to above Hc1 150 mT to map out the transition from the Meissner state to vortex formation SANS will then be collected with a field above Hc1 to directly observe if the superconducting vortex lattice couples to the site or anti-site of the skyrmion lattice Measurements will be carried out with the field applied parallel and anti-parallel to the skyrmion core This changing of field has been predicted to flip the vortex ordering from site to anti-site with respect to the skyrmion by theorists Control measurements will be carried out above the critical temperature where the Nb is not superconducting Samples with size greater than 1 cm x 1cm will be measured using 12  wavelength We aim to measure a single sample without stacking multiple due to concerns about temperature gradients that may occur across the samples since this could destroy the relevant superconducting effects However 5 samples will be prepared in the scenario that stacking is found to be the only way to obtain a sufficient signal We anticipate each measurement taking 3 - 4 hours Room temperature measurements will be collected first to confirm the skyrmion state and to assist in aligning the sample with respect to the magnetic field After cooling measurements will be taken with zero field at 3 and 12 Kbelow and above the critical temperature of Nb respectively In addition to the sample with direct FS coupling one with an oxide layer separating the F and S layers will be also measured in zero field After resetting the skyrmion state we will incrementally increase the applied in situ field 15 steps until a vortex lattice is formed in the Nb and a final measurement will be taken with the field applied in the opposite direction Finally we will remove the skyrmion state with a field and then measure at the determined vortex lattice field to determine if the vortices generate neighboring skyrmions Thus with time for alignment cooling and measurement of both samples at relevant fields temperatures and background 23 total conditions plus background we request a total of 4 days on VSANS While this experiment can be carried out on NG7SANS we believe the high flux on the VSANS beamline will be invaluable for the success of this experiment since we aim to see these effects in a single large area sample without stacking several References 1 G Yang et al Phys Rev B 93 224505 2016 2 U Gungordu et al Phys Rev B 97 115136 2018 3 Rina Takashima and Satoshi Fujimoto Phys Rev B
