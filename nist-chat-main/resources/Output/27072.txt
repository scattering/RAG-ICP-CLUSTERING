Faraone Beamline Scientist NCNR Eric M Davis Assistant Professor Clemson University Instrument Neutron Spin-Echo NSE Spectrometer Nafion nanocomposites prepared with silica nanoparticles SiNPs have garnered considerable attention in recent years for effectively suppressing undesirable vanadium ion crossover in redox flow batteries without significantly altering the proton conductivity1 With readily available nanoparticle precursors this approach presents a pragmatic approach for scalable synthesis of ionomer membranes with tunable ion selectivity In Nafion-silica nanocomposites Nafion-SiNPs the nanoparticles are traditionally believed assemble in the ionic channels impeding vanadium ion transport via a size exclusion mechanism However recent X-ray2 and contrast-matched neutron scattering1 investigations into the structure of these hybrid membranes report a lack of preferential sequestration of the silica phase into the ionic domains and suggest that the silica nanoclusters were too large to solely reside inside the ionic domains which are 5 nm in size On the other hand several studies have reported a reduction in local chain dynamics of Nafion thin films compared to bulk membranes on SiOx surfaces3 Furthermore two research groups have separately confirmed that electrostatic interactions between the polar side chains of the ionomer and the SiNP surface chemistries can appreciably impact dispersion state of the SiNPs as well as thermo-mechanical properties in the resulting bulk ionomer nanocomposites4-6 To investigate how the impact of these SiNP-ionomer interactions on the local viscosities in nanocomposite films translates to bulk membrane properties we have measured segmental dynamics in Nafion-SiNP membranes at the NIST Center for Neutron Research NCNR facility using a previously granted neutron spin echo spectroscopy NSE beamtime78 Figure 1 shows the intermediate structure factor ISF of a series of Nafion-SiNPs prepared by solution-casting method where a stiffening of segmental motions was observed with introduction of SiNPs and average relaxation times tR for samples with 4 by mass SiNP were reported to be almost five times that for neat no SiNPs membranes However this trend did not persist with increase in SiNP concentration and for the highest SiNP loading 10 by mass SiNP tR were found to be 60 reduced when compared to samples with 4 by mass SiNP loading albeit the dynamics were still slower than neat samples As seen in a former NSE study correlating chain dynamics and hydration content in neat Nafion membranes segmental dynamics and water-mediated transport are coupled9 and it is likely that observed reduction in vanadium ion crossover in Nafion-SiNPs is due to a decrease in segmental dynamics of the hybrid membranes with respect to neat membranes As such we found that the both vanadium permeability data as well as water transport behavior through Nafion-SiNP membranes compliment the NSE findings shown in Figure 178 lending credence to the idea of coupling between polymer dynamics and ion selectivity in Nafion nanocomposites Contingent upon these findings we believe that a systematic investigation of the modification of the SiNP surface chemistry not only offers us a handle on the tunability of various Nafion-SiNP properties such as ion selectivity and SiNP dispersion state but it would also allow us a framework to study the mechanistic origins of some of these properties Interestingly Nafion-SiNPs prepared via solution casting have been shown to exhibit a variation in SiNP-ionomer interactions where the strength of this interaction was observed to be dependent on the SiNP size surface charges and dispersion state6 As such we intend to investigate the change in segmental dynamics in solution-cast Nafion-SiNP Figure 1 Intermediate structure factor for solution-cast Nafion with 0 by mass r 4 by mass  and 10 by mass  SiNPs at 298 K and  13 -1 Curves shifted for clarity 2 membranes at the length scale of fluorocarbon chain packing with the incorporation of SiNPs of different surface functionalizations using neutron spin echo spectroscopy NSE During the casting process Nafion chains have a higher degree of freedom to assemble around nanoparticles ie higher conformation entropy This creates a scenario where the SiNPs simultaneously maximize their ionic interactions while being partially absorbed in the hydrophobic phase7 As the SiNP dispersion state is expected to be thermodynamically driven the surface chemistry of SiNPs provides us with a direct control on the various SiNP-ionomer interactions Figure 2 shows five distinct SiNP surface chemistries with positively charged amine-type or negatively charged sulfone-type or uncharged fluorocarbon-type surface distributions that we intend to study The impact of surface chemistry on SiNP dispersion state is evident from electron microscopy images and small angle neutron scattering data not shown captured for hybrid membranes prepared using four of these charged SiNPs5 As seen in these images while the SiNPs are evenly dispersed throughout the ionomer matrix aggregate size and size distribution vary across all four samples containing SiNPs with charge-bearing surface chemistries Recently our group successfully introduced a short chain fluorocarbon based charge-neutral functionality on SiNPs although we currently do not have imaging data on these SiNPs However because we expect the fluorocarbon-SiNPs to be cloistered by the fluorocarbon-rich region of the ionomer and because these composite membranes appear to be most effective in inhibiting vanadium crossover see Figure 2 probing the dynamics in hybrid membranes formed with these nanoparticles is a promising step towards unraveling the origins of the nanoparticle-ionomer interactions and their impact on ion selectivity Preliminarily we characterized segmental dynamics in Nafion-SiNP membranes containing 10 by mass alkyl-amine functionalized SiNPs Figure 2a using discretionary NSE beamtime Herein we observed a curious two-stage relaxation process at  11 -1 Figure 3 The ambiguity regarding a second stage relaxation at this length scale currently makes it difficult to compare this system with our previous study We believe that this second event arises from motions of the alkyl chains tethered to the SiNP surface see Figure 2 Hence a comparison between nanocomposites with the same surface chemistry amine or sulfonic but with different chain lengths and stiffnesses long versus short should help elucidate this relaxation event Figure 3 Intermediate structure factor for solution-cast Nafion with 10 by mass alkyl-amine functionalized SiNPs at 298 K and  11 -1 Fluorocarbon- SiNP Figure 2 Surface functionalizations on SiNPs and TEM images of their dispersion in Nafion The bar plot bottom right shows the vanadium ion permeability of Nafion- 5 by mass SiNP membranes formed using these SiNPs Scale of TEM images  100 nm Long-alkyl-amine SiNP Short-alkyl-amine SiNP Short-alkyl-sulfone SiNP Long-alkyl-sulfone SiNP 3 Thus we propose to characterize solution-cast Nafion membranes containing 5 by mass SiNPs prepared with aforementioned surface chemistries at -values of 11 -1 and 13 -1 In a prior wide-angle X-ray scattering WAXS study prominent structure peak was seen in Nafion and Nafion-SiNPs in the Q-range of 08 -1 - 14 -1 attributed to overlapping amorphous and crystalline features in the ionomer matrix and therefore our experiment should be able to capture fluorocarbon dynamics as a function of fluorocarbon packing in the range of 10 -1  Q  14 -110 Adequate polarized diffraction experiments in the range 08 -1   15 -1 will be performed prior to commencement of the dynamic studies All samples will be equilibrated in D2O at room temperature for 24 hours prior to the experiment Separately WAXS studies will be performed on these samples to determine the changes in morphology due to incorporation of functionalized SiNP at the length scales of interest From prior experience we estimate that each inelastic spectrum will require approximately 12 hours for sufficient statistics On this basis we request a total beam time of 6 days 5 samples x 2 Q values x 12 hours  1 day where an additional day is included for sample changes and background and resolution statistics collection resolution will be collected using NIST TiZr alloy Per our hypothesis ionomer chain dynamics are coupled with the transport phenomena that govern vanadium ion crossover through these membranes In conjunction with NSE experiments we have characterized the bulk swellingrearrangement dynamics in these nanocomposites using the time-resolved Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflection FTIR-ATR spectroscopy wherein a correlation between bulk viscosity of the different nano-segregated phases of Nafion and nanoparticle concentration is evident We are in process of preparing a manuscript on this work and data from the requested beamtime would be a valuable addition to it We believe that these combined studies will provide a bottom-up approach to unraveling a holistic model for transport of aqueous penetrants in ionomer nanocomposites and will be thankful for awarded beamtime as well as constructive reviews References reference in bold represent
