Deciphering the interface between the small lipidated GTPase Arf1 and its ArfGAP ASAP1 Introduction Most aspects of cell membrane signaling and trafficking are regulated by the assembly of dynamic signaling platforms which associate with cell membrane surfaces in a lipid dependent fashion Among them ADP-ribosylation factor-1 Arf1 controls membrane traffic steps that contribute to invasion and metastasis of cancer cells Like other Ras-related GTP-binding proteins Arf1 couples a GDPGTP switch to a cytosol- membrane cycle by which the active Arf1 is loaded with GTP and attached to the membrane where it interacts with its effectors This cycle requires Sec7-domain containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors GEFs which stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP and Arf GTPase-activating proteins ArfGAPs which stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP and initiate the dissociation of Arf1- dependent signaling hubs Complexes between Arf1 and ArfGAPs are therefore finely tuned machineries characterized by extended protein- protein interfaces and multiple protein - lipid interactions to precisely position Arf1 and ArfGAPs domains at the membrane This project focuses on mapping the interaction between ASAP1 a multi-domain ArfGAP protein which has elevated expression and correlation with poor prognosis in a number of cancers with its substrate Arf1 ASAP1 has a core catalytic domain composed of PH Arf GAP and Ankyrin repeat domains 325-72 ASAP1 referred to as PZA for PH Zinc binding which comprises the Arf GAP catalytic domain and Ankyrin repeat domains The PH domain is immediately N-terminal to the catalytic Arf GAP domain and potentiate the phosphatidylinositol 4 5- bisphosphate PIP2-dependent conversion of ADP-ribosylation factor-1 Arf1 from its GTP to GDP bound form Preliminary Work Previous studies have shown that the Arf Gap activity of the ASAP1 PZA requires coincidence association of the PH domain with Arf1 and multiple PIP2 at the membrane interface However the interface between the PH domain and Arf1 is poorly understood The goal of this project is to combine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR Molecular Dynamic simulation MD and Neutron Reflectometry NR to decipher that interface Over the last few years our lab has developed the expertise to produce milligram quantities of different isotopically labeled versions of ASAP1 PH ASAP1 PZA and Arf1 including deuterated versions of the proteins which is necessary for NR and NMR experiments1 We recently combined NMR NR and 1 O Soubias F Heinrich S Pant Y Zhang J Li M E Yole P A Randazzo M Lsche E Tajkhorshid and RA Byrd Membrane Docking Geometry and lipid interactions of ASAP1 PH Domain Bound to a Target Lipid Bilayer An NMR NR and MD Study In preparation MD simulations in collaboration with the Tajkhorshid group at University of Illinois and Frank Heinrich NIST to elucidate the membrane docking geometry and the fundamental interactions of ASAP1 PH domain bound to bilayer-embedded PIP2 in the absence of Arf2 Remarkable agreement was obtained between the different techniques In particular the orientation and depth of insertion of the PH domain at the membrane interface obtained by NR was consistent with the ones calculated from MD as well as the ones qualitatively determined by NMR Paramagnetic Resonance Enhancement NMR PRE using nanodiscs as bilayer mimics A summary of the findings is presented on Fig 1 Figure 1 A Snapshot of the PH domain -PIP2 interaction at the membrane obtained by MD B Best-fit lipid bilayer and median protein spline and high-resolution-structure profiles from data measured after 40 M PH-domain incubation The dotted line shows the high-resolution structure PDB 5C79 at an orientation  295 75 that was determined as the most likely orientation in the rigid body modeling fit C left 1H-13C methyl HMQC spectrum of nanodisc- bound ILV methyl 13C labeled perdeuterated ASAP1- PH domain N200 M DMPCd54 PI45P2 955 molmol P100 M D20 buffer temp 298 K Right Methyl 1H R1 of I 353 as a function of Gadavist concentration with  and wo nanodiscs  highlighting membrane penetration of the 1-2 loop of the PH domain 2 Li Y Soubias O Li J Sun S Randazzo P A Byrd R A Functional Expression and Characterization of Human MyristoylatedArf1 in Nanodisc Membrane Mimetics Biochemistry 2019 58 10 14231431 00102030405000 05 10 15 20Gd3 mMR 1s-1FreeBoundI 35313C Chemical Shift ppm1H Chemical Shift ppm10152025000408 -
