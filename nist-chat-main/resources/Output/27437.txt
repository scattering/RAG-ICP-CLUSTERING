Ce Mixed Valence in Spin Chain Candidate Ce2Ni2In It is widely believed that the large moments derived from strong spin-orbit coupling in rare-earth based materials lead to classical magnetism There is mounting evidence that emergent energy scales due to orbital exchange can lead to definitive quantum character like fractionalized excitations such as the observation of spinons in neutron scattering measurements on Yb2Pt2Pb evidence for spin charge separation in that emphatically metallic compound where the Yb ions are trivalent and hence magnetic Wu 2016 Gannon 2019 This is evidence that the magnetism in Yb2Pt2Pb can be considered one-dimensional Up to this point virtually all spin chain systems that have been investigated are insulating A question of central interest is whether such a spin system embedded in a metallic environment would have different properties For instance the one-dimensional Kondo necklace first proposed by Doniach Coleman 2010 Doniach 1977 where exchange coupling between conduction electrons and localized moments leads to Kondo compensated or magnetically ordered ground states akin to those seen in three dimensional Kondo lattices which are largely conventional Fermi liquids In the absence of this exchange coupling the magnetic excitations revert to being spinons as in an insulating spin chain This is the situation we envisage for Yb2Pt2Pb Our hypothesis is that there is a phase transition or crossover as a function of J between these two qualitatively different ground states conventional Fermi liquid or magnet vs spin chain coexisting with conduction electrons Fortunately there is a large family of isostructural R2T2X Rrare earth Ttransition metal Xmain group compounds where this hypothesis can likely be tested These compounds form in a layered tetragonal structure with planes of moment-bearing R atoms are arranged into orthogonal dimers Fig1 topologically equivalent to the 2D Shastry-Sutherland lattice Shastry 1981 where magnetic order can be frustrated and where dimensionality plays a decisive role If the planes in a R2T2X system are far apart the magnetism is highly two-dimensional as in Yb2Si2Al Gannon 2018 and Ce2Ge2Mg Gannon 2020 while if they are far apart the system can be thought of as a quasi-one dimensional ladder of orthogonal dimers as in Yb2Pt2Pb and Ce2Pt2Pb Kim 2011 The Yb- conduction electron exchange coupling in 1D Yb2Pt2Pb is vanishing small leading to spinon excitations that are similar to those found in insulating spin chains In contrast Yb2Si2Al shows evidence for strong exchange that leads to mixed valence behavior with a characteristic temperature scale of 300 K Gannon 2018 although it is 2D not 1D Fig 1 Illustration of the structure of Ce2Ni2In Only Ce atoms are shown left View of the basal plane right Side view The black lines represent the unit cell We have explored the R2T2X compound Ce2Ni2In Lukachuk 2003 Kaczorowski 1996 Gordon 1994 and our experiments suggest that may be the mixed valent 1D system that we seek Fig 1 The lattice spacing along the c-axis in Ce2Ni2In is relatively short compared to the in-plane Ce spacing suggesting that the magnetism is likely 1D as in Yb2Pt2Pb The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility T above T800 K is Curie-Weiss after subtracting a constant offset of 0  168x10-4mol-Cecm3 shown in Fig 2AB with effective magnetic moments of 241 Bohr magnetonsCe atom almost the full moment for Ce3 as expected from Hunds rules 254 The Weiss constant is -200K indicating antiferromagnetic correlations along the 001 direction The most prominent feature of the susceptibility is its broad maximum centered at 300 K while below 100 K an additional upturn is observed that continues unabated to the lowest temperature 18 K The original of this upturn is unknown One possibility is that there are stray magnetic impurities present and indeed a Curie-Weiss fit Fig 2C provides an acceptable description of the data revealing a fluctuating moment of only 02 Bohr magnetons Weiss constant -26K Our refinements of the x-ray diffraction patterns rule out secondary phases or any type of site disorder of this magnitude In addition little variation in the Curie constant is observed among different samples These are indications that the source of the upturn could be intrinsic Support for this comes from specific heat measurements Fig 3A which also display an upturn in CT at the lowest temperatures Intriguingly the entropy associated with this upturn Fig 3B is in rough agreement with the moment inferred from the susceptibility measurements Taken together the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements are suggestive that Ce2Ni2In may be close to magnetic order and that they are the consequence of critical fluctuations that are quantum mechanical not thermal in origin We have found no clear evidence for magnetic order in the specific heat measurements to temperatures as low as 005 K The broad maximum in the susceptibility is a fingerprint of strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the Ce f-electrons with an approximate scale of 300 K In the context of the Anderson impurity model this strong hybridization leads to mixed valent character where the Ce 4f-electrons fluctuate among single ion states with different charge and spin The lack of saturation in the isothermal magnetization Fig 2D supports this interpretation suggesting that a very large field would be required to decouple the conduction electrons enabling the subsequent polarization of the f-electrons The measurements to date are suggestive that Ce2Ni2In is mixed valent evidence for strong coupling of the Ce f-electrons to the conduction electrons The neutron scattering experiments proposed here are aimed at establishing the basic energy scales associated with the Ce magnetism in Ce2Ni2In assuming that the ideas familiar from rare earth based heavy fermion and mixed valent systems with 3D character are appropriate It is expected that possible manifestations of 1D character such as the suppression of magnetic order and the emergence of unconventional and fractionalized excitations will only be found at the lowest energies and temperatures Fig 2 A Mag susceptibility of Ce2Ni2In H 01 T along 001 B-C Inverse of the mag susceptibility for high and low temperatures respectively Fits to Currie-Weiss law are shown in blue low-T and red high-T D Isothermal magnetization measured at T19 K Using a powder sample we will carry out inelastic measurements that seek to validate our understanding of Ce2Ni2In First are the energy splittings of the Ce states whose degeneracy has been lifted by the crystal electric fields A broad Schottky peak in CT is observed at 60 K Fig 3A which could be a crystal field excitation The broad maximum in T near 300 K Fig 2A is evidence that the Ce moments have mixed valent character due to strong coupling between the Ce 4f-electrons and the conduction electrons There should be a corresponding quasielastic peak in the inelastic neutron scattering that is also wave-vector independent Secondly the upturns in the susceptibility and CT indicate that there are fluctuating moments at the lowest temperatures in Ce2Ni2In Given that there is only one Ce site in Ce2Ni2In we conclude that for temperatures well Fig 3 A Specific heat of Ce2Ni2In divided by temperature CT vs T B Entropy S of Ce2Ni2In vs T Left axis shows S in units of Jmol-Ce-K while right axis shows S in units of Rln2 R  ideal gas constant below 300 K all Ce ions are equally co-opted into the mixed valent state The resulting low temperature Anderson lattice state is likely to be a metal with moderate electron correlations that could ultimately lead to magnetic order The upturn in CT and T suggest that this order may start to develop below 5-10 K consistent with 26 K Weiss temperature The apparent absence of magnetic order at temperatures approaching 005 K may be a consequence of strong quantum fluctuations due to the interplay of dimerization and interdimer coupling in the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice The presence of fluctuating moments may lead to a second quasielastic peak in Ce2Ni2In with a much smaller energy width and as well pronounced wave-vector dependence associated with the frustrated magnetic order Of course a completely different interpretation is that Ce2Ni2In has 1D character and the excess fluctuations at low temperature are the spinons ill-resolved in a powder experiment We will look for them in a single crystal experiment that is proposed separately using DCS Finally we will carry out a brief experiment on a 005 g single crystal of Ce2Ni2In seeking evidence for possible magnetic order Guided by our experiments on Yb2Pt2Pb Miiller 2016 which orders at 207 K with a complex magnetic order in the dimerized planes we will do diffraction scans along potential ordering wave vectors in the HHL planes to search for incipient or bona fide order Altogether we request 3 days on BT-7 to carry out these investigations We request the 2 K CCR with 05 day for the inelastic scan with the largest energy transfer of 135 meV or possibly even larger depending on the scattering strength measured at base temperature Scans at much lower energy transfers to look for a lower energy quasielastic peak will be carried out at several different temperatures and wave vectors amounting to 15 days All the inelastic scans will be carried out on a 2 g powder sample of Ce2Ni2In made by crushing single crystals The absorption of Ce2Ni2In is moderate and we feel confident we can fill the beam using a double-wall cylinder A third day will be used for the single crystal diffraction scan also carried out in the CCR References Wu LS et al
