Screening lengths and concentration fluctuations in semiflexible bio-polymer solutions Cellulose based polymers are widely used as rheology modifiers in cosmetics food and oil drilling products or as conductive polymer in lithium batteries The biomass production of cellulose exceeds 1012 tons per annum making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as the starting product for polymer synthesis  Cellulose is insoluble in water and other common solvents and for applications requiring solubility eg rheology modifiers the hydroxyl groups of the monomer are substituted with different functional groups Structurally cellulose ethers differ from typical synthetic polymers in their larger rigidity typically displaying Kuhn lengths of 10-20 nm compared to 1-4 nm for flexible polymers eg PS PDMS or PMMA In aqueous solution cellulose ethers aggregate into supra-molecular structures via hydrogen bonding These properties make cellulose ethers display enhanced viscosities and pseudoplasticity in solution compared to common synthetic polymers For most industrial applications cellulose ethers are used in semidilute or concentrated solution where polymer chains strongly interpenetrate forming a network with mesh size x The correlation length sets both the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of polymer solutions It is therefore crucial to obtain reliable measurements for different systems to understand and predict their properties For systems where polymer-solvent interactions are repulsive de Gennes scaling predicts a crossover between good solvent at low concentrations to q solvent when the size of the correlation length x decreases to the size of the thermal blob x T An alternative theory predicts the existence of a broad concentration regime known as marginal solvent for solutions that are not very close to the q point or very deep into the good solvent regime A key difference between the theories is that de Gennes scaling expects the correlation length to be independent of excluded volume strength as long as x  xT Marginal solvent theory on the other hand expects much stronger dependence of x on excluded volume strength Experimentally the excluded volume strength can typically be varied by changing the temperature Hydroxypropyl cellulose HPC is a good model system to compare de Gennes theories with those of marginal scaling because the conditions under which marginal solvent is expected to apply correspond to a wide polymer concentration and temperature range Water is a q solvent for HPC at T42oC and a marginal solvent at room temperature The experimental determination of x is considered in the next section Figure 1 plots the overlap and entanglement concentrations of HPC in aqueous solution as a function of degree of polymerisation The overlap concentration is given by c  140N-09 and the entanglement concentration is found to occur at  4c for 100N3000 The Kuhn length is estimated form the variation of the intrinsic viscosity with molar mass and found to be lk  22 nm The purpose of this experiment is to understand how the correlation length and osmotic compressibility of semiflexible polymer solutions varies as a function of solvent quality excluded volume strength and concentration To this end we plan to measure the SANS profiles of HPC in q marginal and good solvent conditions Results will be complemented by osmotic pressure measurements to probe the strength and nature of inter-chain contacts We next discuss how the data will be analysed and then detail the experimental plan Concentration fluctuations in semiflexible polymer solutions There are two approaches to obtaining the correlation length of semiflexible polymers in solution The random phase approximation RPA originally developed for flexible polymers was adapted by Doi and co-workers to semiflexible and rigid polymers  This model predicts the reciprocal scattering intensity at low q to vary as Iq-1  A  Bq2   1 where I0  1A and x BA12 is the correlation length Doi et als model expects Eq 1 to hold for q  lK1 For larger q the Iq approaches the single-chain scattering of a rigid object Iq  krpbq where r is the density of monomers k a contrast factor and b the monomer length A separate model introduced by Horkay and co-workers  predicts instead I2q-1  A  Bq2   2 where I0  1A12 and x  BA Equation 2 has been shown to describe experimental data for semiflexible polysaccharide sodium hyaluronate NaHy in excess NaCl solution  Unfortunately multi-chain clusters dominate the scattering signal at low q and it is therefore not possible to observe the low-q plateau predicted by Eqs 1 and 2 for the NaHyD2ONaCl system Preliminary results for HPC in D2O show that the aggregation is sufficiently weak for this system that a plateau at low q can be observed see Fig 2 Experimental plan Our first aim is to measure the SANS profiles of HPC solutions as function of temperature 5-40 oC in the semidilute regime The measured data will be fit to the Horkay and Doi models and the results for x compared with theoretical estimates The value of I0 will be compared with osmotic pressure P measurements using the well-known relation I0 k c dcdP This comparison will allow us to elucidate whether Eq 1 or 2 provides the most reasonable estimate of I0 Further measurements in d-THF a thermodynamically good solvent will be carried out at selected concentrations Our results will yield insight on length-scales at which concentration fluctuations occur in semiflexible polymers as a function of concentration and solvent quality and will provide a test for two current theories for the scattering intensity of such systems In combination with rheology data x measurements will help us understand entanglement formation in semiflexible systems Beam time We plan to measure 5 concentrations x 7 temperatures in D2O and 5 concentrations in THF at room temperature  40 samples The average acquisition time for a
