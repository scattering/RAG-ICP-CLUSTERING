Water Management when testing PEMFCs with Asymmetrical GDM pairing Yannick Garsany1 Robert W Atkinson III1 Benjamin D Gould2 Karen E Swider-Lyons2 1EXCET INC Springfield VA 22151 2US Naval Research Laboratory Washington DC 20375 Scientific background and anticipated impact Proton exchange membrane fuel cell PEMFC power production is highly influenced by the properties of the gas diffusion media GDM The majority of the fuel cell literature on gas diffusion media to date has focused on the influence of the cathode GDM This is justified considering the opposing transport processes that must be mediated effectively in order to achieve high fuel cell power production oxygen ingress and product water egress However recent studies show that small changes in anode GDM material properties or operational parameters can significantly influence fuel cell water management and power production In operando neutron imaging by Meyer et al observed that changing properties in the anode GDM such as hydrophobicity porosity and thickness dramatically changes water saturation and transport in the cathode  The anode GDL weave pattern has been recently shown to influence water management by shifting the fuel cell net water flux from cathode to anode  Fixing the cathode but making a small change in the anode has implications for cell water transport and can shift the water balance in the cell to one that favors water removal from the anode Previous reports have shown that water management can be manipulated by asymmetrically pairing anode and cathode GDM Schweiss reported that an asymmetric GDM pairing with distinct anode and cathode GDM is less sensitive to relative humidity and increases PEFC current density compared to all tested symmetric GDM configurations same anode and cathode GDM  This is achieved by selecting an anode GDM that improves water retention while the cathode is more porous and facilitates high gas diffusivity this is similar to a strategy previously discussed in the patent literature Gandomi et al tailored MPL properties at the anode and cathode to impart asymmetric mass transport and thermal resistances across the cell  Manipulating these two resistances in an asymmetric manner across the cell via changes in the anode and cathode MPL properties allowed the authors to modulate net water drag Similar to the previous studies current density was maximized with asymmetric GDM configurations here achieved when thermal and mass transport resistances were varied asymmetrically from anode to cathode The asymmetric MPL properties strongly influenced net water drag across the cell with the ability to mitigate dry-out at higher current densities  Preliminary work done at NRL has shown that PEMFCs tested with Freudenberg asymmetrical GDM pairings performed significantly better than symmetrical GDM pairings in a broad range of operating conditions see Figure 1 especially in the high current density region of the polarization curves The best performing pairings of GDM contain Freudenberg H24C3 at the anode and H23C2 at the cathode An optimized asymmetric GDM pairing maintains cell hydration but shifts the cell water balance by facilitating water removal from the cathode This reduces cathode water saturation to improve oxygen transport and maximize power Symmetric GDM pairings result in considerably lower current densities compared to the asymmetric GDM pairings that feature unique GDM at the anode and cathode Several symmetric GDM pairings are tested including those that utilize a highly effective anode GDM at both electrodes and a highly effective cathode GDM at both electrodes Oxygen transport resistance measurements by limiting current experiments reveal that symmetric GDM pairings have higher oxygen transport resistances from an increase in liquid water saturation at the cathode Net water drag coefficient measurements show that symmetric GDM pairings rely more heavily on back-diffusion across the membrane to remove product water from the anode than in an optimized asymmetrical GDM pairing Figure 1 Fuel cell polarization curves as a function of GDM selection comparing a PEFC with an asymmetric anode and cathode GDM pairing to those with a symmetric pairing of GDM The cells are tested in a broad range of inlet relative humidity at a cell temperature of 80C atmospheric pressure and t 100 RHinlet right and 25 RHinlet  Hydrogen and air at the anode and cathode respectively flow at a stoichiometric excess of 2 Figure legend lists the anode GDM followed by the cathode GDM Our limiting current density measurements predict where water may be saturating in the cathode Net water drag coefficient measurement gives us a relative flux of water either out of the anode or cathode However the mechanisms for water transport from these cells and the means by which asymmetric GDM pairings enhance cell water management are still not known Neutron imaging will provide direct visual confirmation of liquid water in the cell Neutron imaging has been used by LANL3M previously to determine water saturation in GDMs and to explore the effect of various GDLs on water management and fuel cell performance  We believe the GDMCL water content will be an important piece of information in the final analysis to quantify all the high current losses present in the symmetrical GDM pairing Proposed experiment We will use neutron imaging to determine water saturation in CLGDLs and to explore the effect of asymmetrical and symmetrical GDM pairings on water management and fuel cell performance Here we refer to membrane electrode assemblies MEAs containing asymmetric GDM when the GDM at the anode and cathode are different We refer to MEAs containing the same GDM at the anode and cathode as containing symmetric GDM Catalyst Coated Membranes 2 cm2 active area will be prepared at NRL using Ultrasonic Spray coating  MEAs are prepared by combining the Freudenberg GDM with the NRL CCMs and Teflon gaskets The MEAs will be assembled at NRL in specially designed differential neutron imaging cells 2 cm2 active area and conditioned in advance of the neutron imaging measurements The assembled MEA will be tested at a cell temperature of 80C at 25 50 and 100 inlet relative humidity RH under stoichiometric flow rate 22 in H2Air The cells thus characterized will be taken to NIST to understand the GDLcatalyst layer water saturation under these pre-determined operating conditions We believe the GDMCL water content will be an important piece of information in the final analysis to quantify all the high current losses present in the symmetrical GDM pairing Experimental Details Three different cells will be evaluated at NIST with all cells being made with the identical membranes assembled in identical hardware using identical gaskets and but different GDMs pairing 1 Asymmetrical GDM pairing H23C3 anode GDM H23C2 cathode GDM 1 day with 15 m detector and 1 day with the 2 m detecto 2 Symmetrical GDM pairing H23C2 anode GDM H23C2 cathode GDM 1 day with 15 m detector and 1 day with the 2 m detecto 3 Asymmetrical GDM pairing H24C3 anode GDM H23C2 cathode GDM 05 day with 15 m detecto The cells will be tested at different pre-determined conditions to highlight high current transport losses We anticipate to run the cells at 80C 2 different RHs 25 and 100 inlet RH and 3 different current densities 06 15 and 2 mA cm-2 for a total of 6 different conditions per sample on the 15 m detector We will evaluate a much smaller area 3 x 4mm field of view on the 2 m detector and limit ourselves to imaging only 2 of the conditions for  8 hours each along with a dry image to get good statistics for GDMCL water content on the 2 m detector The data and subsequent resulting understanding will be presented at technical conferences and will be published in peer-reviewed journals Anticipated Beam Time The anticipated neutron imaging beam time for these experiments is five days NIST will supply the cell hardware and NRL will provide the fuel cell materials CCMs GDMs and Gaskets The 15 m detector will be used for 25 days and the 20 m detector for 2 days with 05 day to switch between the two detectors References  Q Meyer S Ashton P Boillat M Cochet E Engebretsen DP Finegan X Lu JJ Bailey N Mansor R Abdulaziz OO Taiwo R Jervis S Torija P Benson S Foster P Adcock PR
