1 Structural characterization of nacre-like materials composed of CaCO3 within chitosan and cellulose multilayered films using Small and Ultrasmall-Angle Neutron Scattering Abstract The fabrication of nacre-like materials by biomimetic mineralization has gained attention as it represents an effective strategy for obtaining materials with outstanding mechanical performance However it remains technically demanding to scale the production of nacre-biomimetic materials by using this approach due to the poor interfacial bonding of reagents in a dynamic mineralization process Moreover due to the variability in the dimensional distribution on the nano to microscale of these materials a depth analysis of its microstructure is challenging Here we propose to use small and ultrasmall angle neutron scattering SANS and USANS respectively to explore the internal structure and interfacial strength of nacre-like multilayered films prepared using different strategies organic additives and surface chemistries for CaCO3 mineralization These analyses will provide strong guidance for optimize the fabrication of these materials BackgroundSignificance Nacre provides a vast source of inspiration for the development of functional materials with outstanding mechanical properties The reason for its exceptional mechanical performance is mainly attributed to its unique hierarchically brick-and-mortar layered structure composed of aligned aragonite a mineral form of CaCO3 platelets surrounded by a small content of polymer mostly chitin which enables multiple toughening and strengthening mechanisms 1  In this way there has been increasing interest in this biodesign to fabricating high-performance composites with emerging improved properties that can benefit applications in diverse fields eg multifunctional and smart coatings  structural composites  energy storage devices  etc In biomimetic engineering the CaCO3 based polymer-induced liquid precursors PILPs combined with the layer-by-layer deposition of organic films has been established as an innovative method to produce nacre-like hybrids materials 5  However a critical challenge in the production of these materials by using this approach is to achieve controllable mineralization pathways to continuous CaCO3 coatings Although numerous nacre-like materials have been obtained their reported mechanical performance is still limited due to the poor interfacial bonding between the polymer matrix and CaCO3  Thus the internal structure and connectivity between layers over a range of length scales on the nano to micro scale are directly responsible of the mechanical performance on these composites  This kind of research may be preliminary addressed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy of cross-section samples However these methods are inadequate for the complete modelling of the internal structure of multilayer films since they explore a limited dimensional range of a specific areavolume In the case of more complex structural materials layer-by-layer removal of the sample followed by microscopy imaging has been used to reconstruct their structures  An important disadvantage of this method is that it is destructive in nature with the possibility of altering the sample surfaces Thus a quantitative description of the micro-architecture of multilayered composites is generally very difficult In this regard optimal results can be achieved by using small and ultrasmall-angle neutron scattering USANS which can potentially yield additional structural information over a range of length scales 1 nm-30 m Here we propose to use SANS and USANS to characterize the internal structure and interfacial strength of CaCO3 within chitosan and cellulose multilayered films prepared using different strategies to obtain continuous hierarchical CaCO3 layers A similar approach was successfully applied to explore the biomineralization of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate in multilayered films 1 The use of both SANS and USANS was also crucial to resolve hierarchical structures in nanocomposites with high carbon nanotube loadings 1 Planned experiments The samples will be prepared via sequential infiltration of PILPs-CaCO3 into layers of chitosan Ch and cellulose nanofibril CNFs films see Figure 1 Moreover particular attention will be paid to 2 the influence of varying layer thicknesses on the interface bonding in samples Therefore three different layer thicknesses are used for each sample i 35-75 m-150 coupled layers of 250-500 nm ii 300-600 m-150 coupled layers of 2-4 m and iii 900-1500 m-150 coupled layers of 6-10 m The use of both neutron scattering techniques can characterize the internal structure and connectivity of these multilayered films To reach this overall objective the proposal is focused at three levels specific objectives O to determine  O1- the changes induced by using Ch and CNFs as substrates for CaCO3 mineralization  O2- the importance of the seed layer in the mineralization of CaCO3 Therefore the deposition of the CaCO3-poly aspartic acid PAsp hybrid will be performed on the Ch and CNFs layers  O3- the effect of the surface functionalization of the organic layers Ch and CNFs through hydrophobic methyl trimethoxysilane MTMS to modify wettability towards the liquid CaCO3 precursors Controlling the wettability between layers could induce a better control in the mineralization pathway Therefore twelve multilayer films based on Ch and CaCO3 with three sample thicknesses 35-75 m 300-600 m and 900-1500 m and other twelve samples composed by CNFs and CaCO3 will be used These multilayer films containing 150-coupled layers for obtaining optimal scattering statistics Thus the experiments will be performed on the following samples 1-3 Ch non-functionalized MTMS and CaCO3 with three different thicknesses 4-6 Ch functionalized MTMS and CaCO3 7-9 Ch non-functionalized MTMS and CaCO3-PAsp hybrid and 10-12 Ch functionalized MTMS and CaCO3-PAsp hybrid 13-15 CNFs non-functionalized MTMS and CaCO3 16-18 CNFs functionalized MTMS and CaCO3 19-21 CNFs non-functionalized MTMS and CaCO3-PAsp hybrid 22-24 CNFs functionalized MTMS and CaCO3-PAsp hybrid A comparison of the SANS and USANS profiles of the multilayer films with Ch and those obtained with CNFs samples 1-3 and 13-15 will indicate if the biofilm type can induce changes in the internal structure-interfacial bond strength between layers O1 Comparing samples with and without PAsp samples 1-3 and 7-9 13-15 and 19-21 will show modifications in samples in terms of mineralization efficiency O2 Functionalization of Ch and CNFs with MTMS will show any differences in structural control of mineralization with the induced wettability change samples 1-3 and 4-6 13-15 and 16-18- O3 Finally SANS and USANS curves for all samples will reveal information on the structural features that exist in the systems at different thicknesses SANS and USANS measurements will be conducted on the NGB 30m SANS instrument and BT5 USANS instrument respectively Each multilayered sample will be placed into standard titanium cells with the beam incident perpendicular to the samples SANS patterns will be recorded at three sample-to-detector distances 1 4 and 13 m at wavelength  of 6  and 13 m for the  84  For the USANS measurements the wavelength will be 24  and data will be collected in the Q-range 5x10-5  Q  27 x 10-3 1 The experimental procedure also includes the correction of the scattering intensity data for empty-beam scattering background counts sample transmission and scattering volume and reduced to an absolute scale Due to the thin-layer nature of the samples previous experiments carried out by SANS in a single sample consisting of six layers Figure 2- note that the scale is in arbitrary units and the experimental conditions of recent works with similar approaches 10 1 we request a total of 4 days beam-time 1 day to SANS and 3 days to USANS SANS and USANS data reduction and analysis will be accomplished using the data reduction software provided by NISTNCNR Moreover physical parameters will be obtained from the scattering data of the nacre-like multilayered samples by using different models as done in previous studies power law model to fit low-q scattering the lamellar model to fit the mid-q region and the Gaussian-Lorentz gel model to describe the high-q region 1 This analysis will enable to characterize the structure of these multilayered films in a range of length scales that span polymer-mineralized CaCO3 platelets interfaces individual CaCO3 platelets and aggregates of CaCO3 platelets into the films The Beaucage model will also be used to explain the hierarchical structures in samples 1 3 We anticipate that these experiments will provide thus a new deep insight into the correlation between the physicochemical properties and the spatial configuration of microstructures within hierarchical multilayered materials Therefore these findings will contribute to optimize the fabrication of nacre-like hybrid materials Additionally the primary applicant has previous experience as main proposer in performing neutron experiments by SANS and imaging in large-scale facilities 12 1 Figure 1 a-h Optical micrographs showing Ch-CaCO3 and CNFs-CaCO3 multilayered films a-d
