 Many forms of energy carrier exist among which electric energy is one of the most precious and serves for a variety of applications Modern batteries offer a variety of advantages over the current rechargeable batteries like NiMH which have a memory effect reducing the maximum chargeable energy over time It is further believed that these batteries play a major role in future plans to store energy in reasonable amount eg for electric cars etc 12 As the need for the lower costs and high flexible applicability of those batteries increases polymer based Li-ion batteries were considered to be a major counterpart to the generic metal batteries Since the application always stands in the foreground the measurement of the conductivity and long-term stability had research priority to optimize those batteries 3 However since the optimization process somehow saturates it was generally believed that a deeper microscopic understanding of the conductivity processes will further improve the performances of these batteries The basic principle of ion-transportation in Li-ion polymer solid polymer electrolyte - SPE battery is that the ion transportation is assisted by the polymers segmental motion and the main chain dynamic Therefore it is generally assumed that lowering glass transition temperature while maintaining mechanical strength is beneficial to the ion mobility and for the battery However fundamental understanding of the microscopic dynamics of such polymeric system which can enlighten the design principles for the polymer batteries has not been achieved yet In several scientific contributions 4 5 6 we were able to look deeper in the interplay between polymer matrix and ions therein using neutron scattering measurements and MD simulations Several studies on related systems can be found in the literature as well To name just a few results we found a temperature dependent dynamical behavior of ions and polymers using dielectric spectroscopy 4 5 6 Also some MD simulations were done eg in 7 8 where it was tried to clarify how the mobility as a whole changed with variation of distances between Oxygens but lacked a microscopic picture While the studies in the past provide critical information such as temperature dependencies of conductivity and rough dimensions for higher Li conductivity microscopic dynamics of polymers are still missing To our knowledge the systematic investigation on the dynamics of PEO comb polymers assisting Li-ion transportation with neutron spin echo measurements in combination with MD simulation has never been done so far except by us 4 We found in common but deuterated PEO that the side chain form cages in which the Li-ion jump from cage to cage and remains in each cage until it decays It happens in a few nanoseconds Then the ion jump to another just formed cage with a jump distance of a few nanometers As a result and during this process the ion conduction takes place Furthermore we were able to see in combination with other experimental techniques to characterize sample and help to interpret the data in addition to NSE measurements and MD simulations that even the backbone helps to form these cages It happens just on slightly longer timescales but still contributes to the decay time of the cages therein This understanding resulted in a major publication 4 In a later work 5 we systematically varied the size of the ions and found - not astonishing - that the Li-ion is indeed the best carriers of the charge in Li-ion Nevertheless the microscopic picture which we could develop in this case helps to understand the process deeper Here we would like to pursue a different approach The discussed approach is very promising and exorbitantly important for the identification of new polymer Li-salt plasticizer combinations because just the microscopic picture can unravel and hint to promising candidates Nevertheless testing these systems under more realistic conditions compared to a battery is even better and to simulate charging and discharging processes one would need to apply an electric field at these combinations could be AC or DC depending on the SPE On the other side and with the requirements for NSE and SANS samples relatively large area it is a technical challenge and has never been realized so far However the gain in knowledge outweighs the risk to fail and so we started to develop an electric field cell some time ago Just recently we were able to come up with a worldwide new cell design which provides DC electric fields of up to 2 kVmm but in our opinion we believe more is possible see Fig 1 The limitations lied mainly in the heating of the cells under the electric field with a given high ion conducting SPE and accordingly cooling is one of the main requirements Also one needs to test the Neutron transmission activation etc but since the design is comparable to Aluminum flat plates Hellma cells no significant reduced transmission or higher activation is expected First tests will take place in December 2019 To avoid heating up the cell too much when applying an electric field one needs to avoid samples SPE with very high conductivity which result in too high electric currents during the experiment Subsequently we implemented a cooling mechanism In addition and to avoid too much incoherent signal we were forced to look out for polymers which we can be properly deuterated at the same time for NSE experiments We found a polymer as SPE which is still very promising - namely Poly ethylene carbonate 9 10 As preparatory work we already performed NSE measurements of this polymer without any electric field see Fig 3 and now we know the Q temperature and Fouriertime range In addition the design of the electric field cell was optimized such that transmission of the electric field is supposed to be around 100 The open question is how does the electric field which triggers the movement of Li-ions between the electrodes influences the polymer electrolyte dynamics  Please note we will directly simulate a realistic situation in a battery and just NSE is able to see the polymer dynamics with properly deuterated protonated the polymer Fig 1 Prototype of flat plate electric - field cell optimized for SANS and NSE instruments Naturally more equipment is needed for the proper operation Although commissioning with the NIST - NSE was started already Please note the E-field is perpendicular to the Neutron trajectory Poly ethylene oxide PEO is the most commonly used polymer for SPEs Here we carefully choose a different very promising homopolymer so called poly ethylene carbonate PEC which is related to PEO see Fig 2 9 10 Preliminary measurements of the conductivity which depend strongly on the Li-salt content showed high conductivity values up to 10-4Scm which is slightly lower than PEO to avoid extensive heating of the cell when operating under electric field Fig 2 Polyethylene ether carbonate C2H4O4-C2H4O Note the Oxygen with double-bond in red is believed to contribute most to the conductivity process 8 Just to be clear In NSE we will see main chain dynamic of the polymer with a proposed standard 90 deuteration not the Li-ions therein but in the MD simulations we will simulate the Polymer WITH Li-ions therein and calculate the intermediate scattering function When achieving good agreement between SQt from NSE and MD simulations we will be able to conclude on the Li-ion dynamics looking at the simulated MD picture 4 Just the combination of MD simulations with NSE is able to deliver such a deep understanding In addition a full Dielectric spectroscopy DS study was done in which we saw the conductivity and the polymer chain dynamics based on the specific coupling within the technique We learned the relaxations lie in the NSE time and temperature window With the experience and insight of our previous work we believe that we can enhance our understanding on how PEC assists ion transportation by conducting Neutron spin echo NSE experiments at NIST To summarize we plan to study in-house made 9010 - deuteratedprotonated PEC with Li-ions therein when applying an electric field Applying an electric field will simulate the charging and discharging of SPE based Li-ion batteries and is crucial for the understanding of the role of SPE in batteries thereof Also it is preferred to use and AC field but also DC would fulfill our requirements One just needs to be careful when interpreting the data utilizing and DC field cause so called blocking electrodes might change the effective and for the ions visible electric field Fig 3 Polyethylene ether carbonate C2H4O4-C2H4O NSE measurements at the ILL - NSE SQ tSQ vst The upper row shows the homo polymer without Li - ions the middle row a 14 contribution of Li - salt and the lower row with 33 Li - salt The rows from left to right are the temperatures 373K and 353K Note just at highest temperatures there is a remarkable decay in SQ t Thus one needs to heat the system up to at least 373K but even higher temperatures can be addressed because PEC is stable up to 403K DSC and NMR measurements With the cooling mechanism we can tune the temperature under electric field - see Fig 1 Experimental part In this experiment we focus on the PECLi-ion system to gain fundamental understanding of intrinsic SPEs that can provide design parameters for next generation battery materials We would like to measure 90 deuterated 10 protonated at the NIST-NSE PEC with and without Li-content in our electric-field cell for which we expect a transmission close to 100 We would like to study PEC Li-ion systems with 2 different salt concentrations at 373K see Fig 3 in our electric field cell We will measure main chain dynamics while stepwise increasing the electric field up to 2kVmm in 3 steps 0 1000 and 2000Vmm DC We will collect the data in the Fouriertime range from 50ps to 200ns with at least 15 points therein and momentum transfer from 005A-1 to 025A-1 within 4 scattering angle set-ups 30h 3 samples and 3 electric field settings per sample makes it up to 12days Setting up the electric field cell proper thermalization background and resolution measurements should take another 3 days Subsequently we are asking for 15 days of beamtime at the NSE instrument Due to the complexity of this experiment we discussed with the instrument responsible and the experiment was found to be feasible after some adaptions of the instrument Preparatory work has already been started in a collaborative manner However most of the equipment eg power supply electric field cells temperature controller masks and adapter plates will be supplied by the us Naturally prior safety checks will have to be done at NIST so we would wish for early beamtime notification beamtime if granted Data treatment We studied PEC at the ILL - NSE without any electric field but will be able to directly compare already gathered SQ t here A relaxation map including other techniques like dielectric spectroscopy has been done MD simulations incl force fields from the external electric field shall take place so we are able to directly relate to the intrinsic mechanism of the polymer chain driving the Li-ion conductivity mechanism We are also working on MD simulations modelling the dynamic behavior under field Naturally we wish to publish the results in a high ranking journal References 1 H D Abruna et al Phys Today 61 43-47 2008 2 J M Tarascon et al Nature 414 359-367 2001 3 N Kamaya et al Nat Mater 10 682-686 2011 4 C Do et al Phys Rev Lett 111 018301 2013 5 Z Zhang et al Phys Rev Lett 115 19 19801 2015 6 M Ohl et al in preparation  7 D Diddens et al Macromolecules 43 4 2028-2036 2010 8 J Karo et al  Solid State Ionics 176 2005 3041 -
