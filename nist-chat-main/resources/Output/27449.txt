In recent years there have been increasing efforts to look for exotic magnetic ground states beyond simple ordered states such as spin liquid or superconducting phases Conventional wisdom suggests that simple ordered ground states can be destabilized in the presence of strong charge fluctuation or magnetic frustration As an example of the former robust magnetic order in strong Mott insulator such as layered cuprates is strongly suppressed as charge carriers are introduced by doping leading to a superconducting phase followed by a normal metallic phase where magnetic order is absent  On the other hand magnetic order in an insulating system can also be completely destroyed in geometrically frustrated lattice such as Kagome lattice resulting in a spin liquid phase  Naively one expects when both ingredients are present they would cooperate to suppress the magnetic order However a striking exception is found in the system FeCrAs whose lattice structure is shown in Fig 1 The magnetic Cr atoms form layers of distorted Kagome lattice which are separated by layers of Fe trimers  The specific heat of FeCrAs shows linear temperature dependence reminiscent of a Fermi liquid Although transport measurement revealed a nonmetallic behavior a power law temperature dependence of resistivity instead of a simple activated behavior expected for an insulator suggests its close proximity to a metal-insulator transition and therefore strong charge fluctuation Despite the presence of both strong electronic itinerancy in FeCrAs as well as high degree of geometric frustration inherent to a Kagome lattice the Cr atoms settle into a spin density wave SDW state below 120K with a complex ordered magnetic structure shown in Fig 2  So far very little is known how such a magnetic order is stabilized in this system and detailed magnetic Hamiltonian In earlier inelastic scattering studies using powder samples we found highly dispersive gapless magnetic excitations extending up to very high energy 80 meV which is much higher than the magnetic ordering temperature scale  See Fig 3 However quantitative understanding of the spin fluctuation could not be gained due to the lack of momentum dependent information To address this question we prepared a collection of co-aligned single crystal samples of FeCrAs 09 g total mass and carried out the initial experiment at ARCS during last run We confirmed that this multi-crystal sample is well-aligned and large enough to provide us with the first detailed look at magnetic dispersion relation in this compound The magnetic excitations in FeCrAs take the form of a highly dispersive spin wave with an in-plane and out-of-plane velocity of 93 meV and 87 meV respectively as shown in Fig 4 suggesting the three dimensional nature of the magnetism This came as somewhat of a surprise given the planar crystal structure Another important finding from this initial experiment was that the spin wave mode was highly damped in the high energy region which is suggestive of itinerant nature of magnetism in this compound However crucial questions needed to understand the magnetic Hamiltonian are still unanswered which will require detailed characterization of low-energy region In previous powder data we confirmed that the mode remains gapless down to at least about 05 meV Fig 3b What is not clear from the powder data is whether there is another mode with a magnon gap which is difficult to resolve For this we will need single crystal inelastic neutron scattering studies Although the dominant magnetic energy scale in this system is revealed by the high-energy spin fluctuations nothing is known about the low energy spin dynamics which contains information on small perturbations such as long-range interactions expected to be significant in an itinerant system as well as any magnetic anisotropies The latter are ultimately responsible for the stabilization of magnetic order in this highly frustrated lattice As a direct extension of our previous experiment we propose to study the low-energy spin dynamics in FeCrAs at MACS inaccessible from our previous experiments due to limited energy resolution 5meV From our previous powder measurement at MACS we will use a final energy of Ef24meV with a Be filter which offers an energy resolution of 05meV and a dynamical coverage up to at least 6meV sufficient to resolve any spin excitations not resolved at ARCS due to coarse energy resolution In addition high flux at MACS is necessary for detecting weak signal of the small total mass of the coaligned signal The sample is aligned on the HK0 plane We will carry out constant energy slice from 0meV to 6meV with a 02meV step to map out the low energy magnon dispersion Mapping out the full magnon dispersion at ARCS takes approximately 3 days we estimate similar counting time at MACS We will map out the low energy magnon dispersion at base temperature as well as study the temperature dependence of the magnetic excitations across the magnetic transition 110K In total we require 7 days of beamtime  B Keimer et al Nature 518 179 2015  L Balent Nature 464 199 2010  W Wu et al Europhys Lett 85
