USA Scientific Importance Archaea are prokaryotic microorganisms and have no cell nucleus Their membranes are made of lipids which show higher stability at high temperature and low pH compared with those of Eukaryotic lipids 1  which can overcome one of the great hurdles presented in oral delivery carriers The hydrocarbon tails of Archaeal lipids connect to the glycerol head group through ether instead of ester linkages and the lipid has two hydrophilic headgroups and a general molecular structure with two identical one-headgroup lipids with one or both of their tails covalently tethered with each other It has been reported that Archaeal membranes have high viscosity  and low permeability 1  presumably attributed to the tethering of tails Nevertheless the understanding of Archaeal lipids remains unclear due to the lacking knowledge about their physical properties such as self-assembling structures lateral lipid diffusion membrane bending rigidity etc Recently Yangs group developed synthetic strategy to yield large quantity on the order of grams of several Archaea-inspired AI lipids as shown in Fig 1a-c One of them is a single-tail tethered AI lipid referred to as D143 hereafter which has 32 carbons on the tethered chain and 16 carbons on each of the two non-tethered chains Fig 1a which can be considered as the tethered version of 12-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with ether linkers DC16ePC as shown in Fig 1e A smallwide angle X-ray scattering SWAXS study of D143 self-assembly in the aqueous solution was compared with that of a DC16ePC analogue 12-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine DPPC solution Fig 1d as shown in Fig 2a The SAXS data from D143 sample suggests that multilamellar vesicles MLVs commonly seen in the DPPC solution also in Fig 2a does not exist The phenomenon is known as the complete unbinding of bilayers in lipid physics The well-defined d-spacing of MLV originates from the Figure 1 Chemical structures of lipids will be used in this study a D143 c U16 b T32 e DC16ePC d DPPC minimum energy of thermodynamic equilibrium between the attraction from van der Waal interaction and the repulsion from Coulombic interaction and thermal undulation The complete unbinding of D143 is intriguing because it is expected that the same PC headgroup and hydrocarbon chains except for the difference in ether or ester linkers should lead to similar van der Waal attraction and Coulombic repulsion for D143 and DPPC The thermal undulation of D143 membrane should be even dampened due to the tethered chain leading to less repulsion and hence more difficult for decoupling the membranes Direct measurement of membrane rigidity would provide important insight into the unbinding mechanism Neutron spin echo NSE has been applied to characterizing the rigidity and thermal undulation of bilayer 4- We propose to perform SANS and NSE on all the newly synthesized AI lipids Fig 1a-c to fully understand the effect of tail-tethering on the dynamic of membrane We also propose to examine the non-tethered DC16ePC Fig 1e as control Preliminary Data Figs 2a and 2b shows the SWAXS patterns and DSC results of DPPC and D143 As mentioned previously the 5 Bragg diffraction peaks at q at q  01 02 03 04 and 05  -1WAXS pattern of DPPC Fig 2a correspond to a well-defined d-spacing of 628  originating from the onion-like MLVs while these sharp Bragg diffraction peaks disappear in the SWAXS data of D143 implicative of complete unbinding A 5-layer ie phosphate-methylene-methyl-methylene-phosphate layers spherical shell model was used to fit the SWAXS data of D143 and yielding the best fit agreeing well the data suggesting that a possible structure of unilamellar vesicle ULV instead of MLV The differential scanning calorimetric DSC thermograms of D143 and DPPC Fig 2b shows that the melting transition temperature Tm of D143 is  25 oC higher than that of DPPC implying that the tethering of tails decreases the mobility of the lipids and thus enhances the ordering of the lipids This observation is consistent with our presumption that the D143 membrane might be more rigid with less thermal undulation than the DPPC ones Experimental Design and Data Analysis In this study NSE will be applied to measuring the bending rigidity of D143 and compared with that of DPPC and the non-tethered version of this AI-lipid DC16ePC In addition we also would like to know the effect of phytanyl isoprene hydrocarbon chains on the bending rigidity of the AI-lipid membranes All the samples are listed in Fig 1 in total 5 Here the bending rigidity of different kinds of AI inspired lipids will be invesitgated below around and above Tm For samples of spontaneouly forming MLVs extrusion will be applied to produce 100-nm ULV before the NSE Figure 2 a DSC and b SWAXS results The solid curves in b show the best fit results a b measurements The bending ridigity  of the membrane can be obtained by the Zilman and Granek model as shown below    002555X55 5G55X55 5G553 Where  is the relaxation time  is the temperature dependent solvent viscosity kB is the Boltzman constant and  is defined as 5  1 3455X555G5 where  can be approximated to be unity due to   kBT We expect to see that the tethering chain will increase the bending rigidity while the phytanyl isoprene hydrocarbon chains will decrease the bending rigidity The ether or ester linkage for the head group is not expected to affect the bending rigidity We will collect the NSE data at q  01  -1 The proposed total number of experimental measurements is 15 5 samples and 3 temperatures each Each measurement will take 8  10 hours leading to estimated 5 days of beamtime Safety Considerations All the samples will be prepared at the experimenters home institute There is no hazardous issue with the lipids and its solvent will be used References 1 Koyanagi T Leriche G Onofrei D
