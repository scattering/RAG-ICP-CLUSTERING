Tuneable Magnetic Superlattices Based on Rare-EarthTransition Metal Multilayers Background and Context Ferrimagnetic Rare-Earth  Transition Metal RETM alloys can exhibit an unusual effect termed magnetic compensation Briefly in RETM alloys where typically TM  Fe or Co the RE and TM moments are oriented anti-parallel to each other and have a different temperature profile Below the Curie temperature the volume magnetization of the TM atoms initially grows more rapidly than the RE moments but at even lower temperatures the RE moments dominate the overall magnetization Magnetic compensation occurs at the temperature where the RE magnetization equals the TM magnetization termed TMagComp and the net magnetization is zero  TMagComp can vary over from 0 K to well over 300 K by modifying the RETM ratio over a relatively small range  Thus material structures can be developed that exhibit nearly uniform nuclear scattering but with very strongly modulated magnetic profiles We will use RETM layered structures to develop magnetic superlattices and other magnetic nanostructures whose magnetic profile can be drastically modified by varying the temperature leading to large changes in the polarized neutron scattering distribution Amorphous ferrimagnetic RE-TM were investigated extensively for magneto-optical recording  Recently research interest in RETM films has picked up as these materials have found application in ultrafast all-optical switching  efficient and tunable THz emitters  domain wall spintronics  and generation and manipulation of topologically protected non-collinear spin textures  Layered RETM magnetic nanostructures with modulated composition may also exhibit topologically protected spin configurations that may have intriguing spin transport properties As mentioned the RE and TM spins couple anti-ferromagnetically due to the hybridization of the RE 5d valence electrons with the 3d valence states of the TM The RE spins reside primarily on the 4f orbitals which are several eV below the Fermi level and thus the spin polarization at the Fermi level is dominated by the TM 3d states By selecting a temperature where the layers of one RETM alloy are below their TMagComp while the other layers are above their TMagComp we can engineer a situation where the Fermi level spin polarization alternates between layers  This should lead to the production of localized magnetic solitons where the soliton number is equal to the number of superlattice cell repeats Such spin configurations may lead to a strong topological Hall effect signature that will be investigated in parallel with the polarized neutron reflectometry PNR studies We will use PNR to determine changes to the magnetic scattering length density m-SLD of compositionally modulated RETM films We use the Tb-Co system as a representative of RE  TM alloys that exhibit magnetic compensation but we note that other combinations such as Gd-Fe or Gd-FeCo can also be used Fig 1-A presents the essential concept We will use a magnetic multilayer structure consisting of alternating layers of Tb22Co78 and Tb18Co82 In the bulk TMagComp for the Tb22Co78 composition is slightly below room temperature while the TMagComp of Tb18Co82 is 150 K although these values will change considerably in thin films At room temperature the film will exhibit both a nearly constant nuclear SLD as well as uniform m-SLD left panel and the neutron scattering will look essentially like the profile from a single thick magnetic layer At low temperatures for example around 150 K the Tb18Co82 will be at compensation and have near-zero magnetization right panel The sample will now act as a magnetic superlattice with pronounced and distinct superlattice Bragg peaks occurring at different scattering vectors for spin up and down neutrons leading to large variations in the PNR spin asymmetry see Fig 1-E Samples and Expected Results We have two sources for our samples First the PI recently completed a Fulbright Fellowship at Uppsala University in Sweden and the research group of Prof Vassilios Kapalakis of Uppsala has been providing Tb-Co thin film samples Second the PI has a sputter deposition system in his lab dedicated to developing thin films of Fe-Gd and similar alloys We present field hysteresis curves for the first compositionally modulated Tb-Co structures in this case a superlattice of Tb18Co82 04 nm  Tb22Co78 04 nmx3 capped with 33 nm of Al2O3 in Figs 1-B in-plane and 1-C out-of-plane The in-plane loop confirms that 3 T is sufficient to saturate the sample out-of-plane field hysteresis curves at 10 K and 280 K exhibit a considerable change in both shape and magnitude The low temperature M-H loop exhibits a single-phase behaviour while the loop at 280 K has a much higher magnetization and coercivity but also displays signatures of two-phase behaviour The rightmost panel in Fig 1-C displays the magnetization vs temperature profile at a relatively high field note that these temperature-dependent data are not corrected for the diamagnetic contribution from the fused silica substrate The data show a significant decrease of the magnetization which is a signature of magnetic compensation and a pronounced anomaly at 50 K that may be related to the strong enhancement of the coercivity in the vicinity of TMagComp In Fig 1-D we present the expected PNR signal from such a structure along with the scattering length density SLD profile As the thickness of the magnetic layers is only 04 nm which is below the typical exchange length in RE-TM alloys the film may behave as single magnetic layer with a nearly uniform m-SLD dashed black line If the different Tb-Co layers retain their distinct magnetic character the m-SLD will be strongly modulated dashed red line and a signature distinguishing these two behaviours should appear in the PNR spin down channel middle panel Fig 1-D As the Tb-Co layers get thicker they are more likely to retain their individual character and in Fig 1-E we present the expected PNR scattering from a Tb18Co82 15 nm  Tb22Co78 15 nmx3  Al2O3 33 nm sample at the compensation temperature of the Tb18Co82 layer The pronounced modulation of the magnetization produces strong and purely magnetic superlattice Bragg peaks at Q  0025 006 01 and 0145 -1 with a considerable splitting of the spin up and down channels while the nuclear SLD is essentially unchanged In Fig 1-F we present the expected scattering from a simpler structure in this instance a simple tri-layer of Tb18Co82 15 nm Tb22Co78 15 nm Tb18Co82 15 nm this structure may be simpler to grow but will still exhibit many similar features such as the rapidly varying and strong spin asymmetry as the superlattice Comparing the different samples with different layer thickness may also permit us to identify the crossover point where the magnetic character of individual layers transforms into single layer behavior We expect that this will occur around the thickness of the exchange length in the RETM alloy Proposal Team The proposal team comprises an international collaboration between Uppsala University sample growth NIST-NCNR neutron scattering and the University of South Florida Tampa FL USA magnetometry sample growth and scattering Proposed experiment We will measure PNR scans on the multilayer TbCo samples to examine the effect of magnetic compensation on the neutron scattering Before the beam run we will characterize all samples with extensive magnetometry and x-ray reflectivity The magnetometry will allow us to identify TMagComp of the different layers as well as relevant magnetic fields for the measurements The non-resonant XRR will look much like the x-ray scattering from a single layer but will serve to constrain the structural models for the PNR scans The overall impact will be to measure the effects of significant magnetic modulation of specific layers in our structures without a corresponding change in the nuclear scattering Beam time request We would like to request 5 days on the PBR reflectometer We would like to measure 2 samples with varying thickness of the layers in questions as well as a simpler tri-layer structure Each sample will need to be measured at two different temperatures at magnetic compensation temperature and another temperature out of compensation to be able to see the contrast in scattering From our previous experience we will need about 12-18 hours per measurement condition resulting in a request for 45 days with an additional 12 hours for set-up debugging and temperature changes
