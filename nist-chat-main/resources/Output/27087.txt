 Scientific Motivation In the last decade there has been a sustained resurgence of the Molten-Salt Nuclear Reactor MSR concept Significant RD efforts propelled MSR into the forefront of the next-generation reactor concepts  This and the importance of molten salts in solar energy fusion and industrial processes resulted in a renewed interest in fundamental properties of these liquids  Specifically the design of fully functional MSRs requires detailed knowledge of the molten salt properties including collective ion dynamics expressed in SQw or van Hove distribution function or dynamic PDF DyPDF3 We are conducting a combined program of measurements and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to understand the multi-component melts in particular a solubility and transport of impurities in relation to the ionic-cluster structure of the fluid  Computer modeling is necessary to predict changes in physical and chemical properties due to irradiation and burning of dissolved fuel that results in the presence of multiple chemical species in the melt We are applying machine learning to develop a fast-acting model that can handle molten salt with arbitrary 10 number of chemical elements This program calls for the use of several inelastic instruments including DCS following initial measurements of pair-distribution function at NOMAD at SNS of NaCl-CrCl3 eutectic see Fig 1 Inelastic measurements are imperative for understanding fundamental properties of technologically important melts This proposal concerns of measurements of DyPDF of NaCl-CrCl32 and NaCl-UCl34 Chromium is one of the most important corrosion products and of great interest to designers of molten-salt-cooled facilities 12 However the local structure and dynamics of Cr ions and complexes are not well known the structure of U3 and U4 in molten NaCl must be understood by ab initio simulations and measurements Recent computer simulations showed significant difference in the local structure and enhanced network formation by U3  that affect solubility diffusivity etc Proposed measurements will test these results Separate proposals are submitted to measure pair-distribution function NOMAD and SQw of this salt at DCS Relatively large amount of Cr has been chosen for several reasons to increase the signal from Cr-Cl tetrahedra and to low the melting temperature Indeed NOMAD measurements showed that about 80 of the signal comes from Cr-Cl pairs Although very small amounts of Cr will be dissolved in operating MSRs our melts are necessary for validating ab-initio simulations This proposal is an extension of the ongoing measurements of PDF at NOMAD of the same salts DyPDF is a technique that has been recently applied for example for metal alloys  The time-dependent generalization of static PDF is related to density-density time correlation van Hove function which underlines the dynamics of liquids for example Maxwell relaxation time3 DyPDF will be measured at low initial energy Ei 10 and 20 meV for high resolution and thus will be limited to Q  6A-1 by kinematics The results will be directly compared with ab-initio simulations that are ongoing both in our group and elsewhere 5 Preliminary Work The salts are commercially available and have been mixed at MIT and characterized by our collaborators using state-of-the-art facilities at the ORNL Chemical Sciences Division PDF has been measured at NOMAD and NSLS-II of NaCl-CrCl3 and will be done in the winter of NaCl-CrCl2 using 53Cr enriched samples see Fig 1 Experimental approach DCS is a direct-geometry spectrometer optimized for high flux at medium resolution The instrument is perfectly suitable for measuring broad spectral features at high temperatures Using low Ei will allow reaching lower Q in order to minimize the reduction in intensity due to the Debye-Waller factor Samples of NaCl-CrCl3 and NaCl-CrCl2 will be used melting points of eutectic compositions are 600C and 450C respectively CrCl2 will be prepared fresh from CrCl3 shortly before the experiment to avoid changing into CrCl3 Other samples are NaCl-UCl34 melting points 520 C and 370 C respectively NCNR has a vacuum furnace suitable for heating the salts above melting To fill the available volume in the furnace about 5 cm3 of the sample is needed Such quantities are available at MIT Samples will be loaded into the furnace in Mo or Nb crucibles melted and measured at two temperatures about 10-50 C above melting The crucibles will be sealed under very low pressure to avoid evaporation and condensation of salts in the furnace and to avoid overpressure of the crucibles at heating The stability of these containers is currently tested and will be tested prior to the experiment at MIT Note that previous experiments in ILL and beyond used vacuum sealed metal crucibles  Tubes of 05 cm diameter will be arc welded and tested in our furnace This thickness is about 1e for absorption due to Cl therefore the absorption will be accounted for We plan for 8-12 hours per sample in the furnace to allow for heating measurements and cooling Samples of up to four different salts in the furnace at two different Ei 10 and 20 meV plus calibration samples and empty cells will require four days Figure 1 left Measurements of partial PDF FOD First-Order Difference is the difference between Gr or NaCl-natCrCl3 and NaCl-53CrCl3 The FOD contains contributions only from Cr distances Cr-Cl Cr-Na and Cr-Cr This is because of the difference in the scattering-length density of 53Cr and natCr b53-420b bnat3635b Right
