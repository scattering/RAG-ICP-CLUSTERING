The effects of replacement reactions on multiscale porosity Pseudomorph Formation Lawrence M Anovitz Michael Cheshire and James Beard Replacement reactions are among the most complex mineral growth and dissolution processes encountered In principal porosity evolution can be calculated by the volume change between dissolving and precipitating ie secondary phases However in practice natural systems display complex behavior Royne and Jamtveit 2015 and even single crystal replacement reactions have been found to develop complex nanoporosity Serpentinization of olivine-rich rocks for instance commonly goes to completion despite a positive net volume change that should not produce any new porosity and thus should seal the system Yuan et al 2016 The goal of this project is to determine how multi-scale porosity changes during net- negative and a net-positive volume-changing replacement reactions and quantify the evolution of the pore structure porosity distribution and reactive surface area To date we have focused on both net-negative and net-positive volume change reactions in multigranular rocks materials Figure 1 shows for example replacement of Carthage marble with fluorite CaF2 by reaction at 200 C with a saturated NH4F solution Porosity was evaluated from core to rim using a series of annular Cd masks of different diameters Example USANS results paper is in submission evaluating core to rim changes in an experimental core are shown in Figure 2 Both the change due to fluorite formation and the effect of initial rock porosity are clear A key factor in these experiments has been the fact that because multicrystalline rocks were used grain boundarypore structure diffusion and transport played an important role in reaction and porosity formation To better understand this effect reactions in porous media need to be coupled to experiments on single crystals undergoing the same reactions as well as analysis of natural reacted single-crystal analogues Such materials are called pseudomorphs as they retain the initial shape of the original crystal while being replaced with a new material Figure 3 If the original material is a single crystal its initial porosity and permeability are very low Replacement must therefore generate its own porosity Thus experiments on replacement reactions on single crystals will allow us to separate the contributions of the rocks porosity from that generated during replacement We propose therefore to use SANS and USANS to analyze the pore structure of cylindrical cores of gem-quality single crystal mineral samples that have undergone pseudomorphic replacement reactions We are therefore performing replacement experiments on calcite replaced by dolomite olivine replaced by serpentine gypsum replaced by barite and pyrite replaced by siderite single crystals with known crystal orientations determined either from backscatter Laue diffraction or observed crystal faces to determine the crystal-face dependence of the reaction rate Reaction conditions are the same as described Figure 1 a Core of Carthage Marble reacted with NH4F at 200C for 45 days Figure 2 Porosity as a function of distance from the rim for two carbonates reacted with NH4F at 200C a bDay 2 Day 45for marble and dunite respectively and a series of experiments will be performed for different times to evaluate the time-dependence of the replacement phenomenon Calcite will be replaced by reaction with MgCl2 and NH4F and olivine by reaction with NH4F and NaOH Because porosity formed in this manner can cover a wide range of scales both SANS and USANS analyses are needed These will be expanded to larger scales up to 1 cm if necessary using autocorrelation analysis of low-magnification high-resolution SEM imagery In order to obtain the best possible overlap between SANS and USANS analyses we have requested to perform the SANS analyses using the VSANS instrument Table 1 shows the geometries of the annular masks to be used in this study As can be seen the average area of these masks is just slightly larger than that of a  diameter mask 028 Our previous experience for analysis of rock samples with these masks has required approximately doubling our standard times to obtain suitable statistics approximately 6 hrsUSANS run approximately 1-2 hoursSANS run We expect to have approximately 2-3 samples of each replacement each of which requires analysis of five masks We thus request 12 days of USANS time and 3 days on the VSANS These studies will be coupled to analysis of naturally-replaced crystals ie pseudomorphs of the same materials Figure 3 The comparison between natural analogues and experimental samples allows us to benchmark the applicability of the processes observed in the experiments against processes that occur in the subsurface A series of such naturally-formed pseudomorphs have already been acquired for this project However as analysis of these samples is constrained by the pre-existing crystal form these are better analyzed using transects or mapping with small spot sizes A parallel proposal has therefore being submitted for USAXS analysis at beamline 9ID at the APS SEM and TEM analyses will also be used to examine pore structures to correlate with and help to understand the scattering data Table 1 Mask geometries Mask  Outer Diameter inches Inner
