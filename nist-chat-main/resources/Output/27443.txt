Measurement of the Jump Diffusion of the Redox Active Organics in IonicSolutionsHossam Farag Y Z University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignAbstract Redox Flow Battery RFB is a promising electricalenergy storage technology with great potential to finally realizealternative energy sources for the next-generation vehicles and atthe grid scales However upon increasing concentrations the flowcell has less cycling stability and more capacity fadeFurthermore after charging the viscosity increases while theionic conductivity decreases and thus the cell becomes overallineffective To understand the mechanism of the increasedviscosity we plan to perform QENS experiments to get an insightof the structural relaxation behaviorBackground and Scientific SignificanceThe design of RFBs is unique as the power scales separately fromthe energy capacity when compared with other batteries  In RFBs the former depends on the size of storagetanks and the concentration of the active materials  Redox-active organic molecules are excellent candidateswith high synthetic tunability for both redox properties as well as importantly solubility Recently ourcollaborators at the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research JCESR have developed a successful RFB testcell with a benzothiadiazole BzNSN anolyte and a 10-2-2-Methoxyethoxyethy-10H-phenothiazineMeept catholyte with lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimideLiTFSI supporting electrolyte and acetonitrile CH3CN as theorganic solvent Figure 1 Furthermore different test cells withdifferent cations of supporting electrolyte and different solventshave been proposed and developed These materials operateeffectively in an RFB test cell at relatively high concentrations 05M BzNSNMEEPT 05 M LiTFSI with stability andelectrochemical behavior close to the JCESR prototype targetsHowever challenging phenomena were observed in those systemsFirst is observed upon increasing redoxmers concentration andsecond upon varying the supporting electrolyte cations In theformer case the flow cell has less cycling stability and morecapacity fade Furthermore after charging the viscosity increaseswhile the ionic conductivity decreases and thus the cell becomesoverall ineffective To understand the mechanism of the increasedviscosity herein we plan to perform QENS experiments to get aninsight of structural relaxation behavior in the ionic solutions Inthe later case the redox potential of the redoxmer exhibits a shiftfrom positive to more negative valuesFigure 2 suggestingdifferent character for redoxmer-ion interaction This hypothesizewas tested by our collaborators in JCESRthrough DFT calculations of the redoxmer-cation system in implicit solvent model Theresults are shown in Figure 3 These twophenomena drove us to propose studying thetransport of such redoxmers under variousconditions of redoxmer concentration andcations types for the supporting electrolyteWe will use combinations of selectivelydeuterated species to highlight the structureand dynamics of different components Figure 1 Molecular Components of theJCESR RFB prototypeFigure 3 DFT Calculations of different Redoxmer-cationsillustrating

was carriedby our collaborators in JCESR Figure 4 It is clear thatthe solution thickens with increasing redoxmerconcentration the source of which we wish to revealFurthermore a recent study by Kristin A Persson  onnon-aqueous electrolytic solution suggests a shift in thediffusion mechanism of the electrolytic species fromvehicular to structural diffusion and sometimes a mix ofboth see Figure 5 Their findings are based oncombination of diffusion and residence time analysiselucidating the mechanism of diffusion via the involvedcharacteristic diffusional length scale which they calledLijc The time and length scales reported are found tobe suitable for HFBS and DCS These two efforts arethe main drives for us to proposeinvestigation the diffusion of theseredoxmer systems revealing informationabout the involved correlation length andrelaxation times in the diffusion  of suchredoxmers offering an experimentalground for the different proposed transportmechanisms exhibited by these redoxmersunder the various mentioned conditions Experimental PlanWe plan to use DCS to measure the redoxmers faster dynamics around room temperatures that cannot becaptured in HFBS To this end we have synthesized deuterated analogs of BzNSN and a model compound ofMeept Deuterated CH3CN along with other organic solvents is commercially available The following tasks areproposed for investigation under this proposal Samples We will measure two types of ionic solutions with Meept catholyte and BzNSN anolyterespectively both at different concentrationsSample 1 05 M Meept 10 M BzNSN deuterated 05

Conditions For each sample we will measure at four temperatures 260 280 300 and320 K Sample Environment We will use cylindrical aluminum containers to hold the sample and sealed withindium to prevent evaporation No detectable reactions between the aluminum and the solution werefound in previous tests The sample thickness 10 mm will be controlled using an insert The sealedsample container will be loaded into top-loading CCR Data Analysis Data will be fitted using the jump diffusion model as demonstrated in  We are alsoperforming MD simulations using the OPLS-AA non-polarizable force field to assist the datainterpretation The MD trajectory will be analyzed using the LiquidLib package developed by our group Beam Time Based on our previous experience 8 hours counting time is needed for each run to obtaingood statistics Considering background measurements and the time needed for sample change andtemperature change we request a total of 5 days beam time for this experimentFigure 4

origin of the viscosity increase of the ionic solutions andthe redoxmer electrochemical character change with varying cations This knowledge is critical to improve thedesign parameters of these ionic
