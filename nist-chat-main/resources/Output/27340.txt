Magnetic depth pro ling of an all-oxide superconducting spin valveJacob Wisser Lauren Riddiford Purnima Balakrishnan Alexander GrutterPatrick Quarterman Julie Borchers and Yuri SuzukiWe propose using polarized neutron re ectometry PNR to obtain a magnetic depth pro le of a MgAl05Fe15O4MAFO  LiTi2O4 LTO  MgAl05Fe15O4 spin valve heterostructure The PNR measurements willprovide critical information on the coupling between the ferromagnetic MAFO layers as well as any in-terfacial phenomena such as suppressed superconductivity at the MAFOLTO interfaces These resultswhen used in conjunction with x-ray dichroism experiments will provide insight into the coexistence ofsuperconductivity and magnetismIntroductionSuperconducting spin valves consist of a superconducting layer in between two ferromagnets In lightof potential magnetic memory applications such spin valves have attracted interest as superconductiv-ity can be turned on or o based on the relative alignment of the magnetizations in the ferromagnetsThis structure also o ers opportunities to study the fundamental physics of superconductorferromagnetinterfaces and exchange coupling between two ferromagnets mediated by superconductivity The mostcommonly observed e ect is the proximity e ect wherein superconductivity is suppressed at the supercon-ductorferromagnet interface This is due to the incompatibility of spin-singlet Cooper pairs  with ferromagnetism which prefers spins to be aligned However there have been recent reports suggest-ing that exchange coupling through a superconductor is possible via spin-triplet pairing or mediation vianodal superconducting states at the Fermi level These studies typically involve inferring the exchangecoupling indirectly via electrical transport or static magnetometry measurements Polarized neutron re ectometry PNR is a very powerful technique that provides depth-resolved mag-netic information by utilizing the spin of neutrons Using PNR it is possible to determine the relativeorientations of the magnetizations in the ferromagnetic layers as well as the expelled magnetic eldin superconducting thin lms and therefore directly observe the preferred con guration of the systemWe plan to use PNR to determine if an isostructural superconducting spin valve prefers ferromagneticantiferromagnetic or no coupling between the two ferromagnetic layersProposed WorkWe propose combining electrical transport superconducting quantum interference device SQUID mag-netometry x-ray dichroism and magnetic depth pro ling via PNR to determine the coupling betweentwo magnetic insulators through a superconducting layer The purpose of the proposed experiment isto provide a magnetic depth pro le of the magnetic insulatorsuperconductormagnetic insulator het-erostructure PNR is extremely sensitive to the orientation of the magnetizations in the MAFO layersand so will easily be able to di erentiate between pro les with and without coupling between the twomagnetic layersWe propose a MAFOLTOMAFO heterostructure MAFO is a ferromagnetic insulator that we havesynthesized as a candidate for low-loss spin current generation and as such displays very soft ferromag-netism crucial for magnetization switching at low elds 15 nm thick MAFO lms grown on MgAl2O4MAO 001 substrates via pulsed laser deposition exhibit very soft magnetism with coercive elds Hcless than 05 mT MAFO has a spinel crystal structure which o ers many opportunities for isostructuralintegration with other materials such as LiTi2O4LTO LTO is a type II superconductor with Tc 12K and upper critical eld Hc2 in excess of 7 T at 4 K We have successfully integrated LTO with MAFOin a superconducting spin valve heterostructure while maintaining the ferromagnetism in the MAFO lay-ers In Figure 1 we show x-ray di raction scans that con rm the epitaxial nature of both the MAFO andLTO lms and SQUID magnetometry performed at 5 K that con rms relatively soft ferromagnetism

visible substrate and lmpeakb Magnetic hysteresis loop taken via SQUID magnetometry at 5 KTo determine if the two ferromagnetic layers are exchange-coupled we will take advantage of the dif-ference in coercivities of the top and bottom MAFO layers Depending on growth conditions thicknessand crystallinity MAFO can have a wide range of coercivities MAFO has the lowest coercivity Hc  05mT when grown directly on MAO in 10 mTorr of O2 at 450 C When heated up to the LTO growthconditions 750 C in vacuum the coercivity increases substantially to 100 mT When MAFO is de-posited on LTO the coercivity is 2 mT With such di erent coercivities we can prepare the system insuch a way that the magnetizations are aligned parallel or antiparallel during the measurement Beforeperforming PNR we propose preparing a eld con guration such that the two MAFO layers should haveopposite magnetization orientations if no exchange coupling through the LTO is present First we applya large negative eld say -1 T to align the two MAFO layers If we then sweep the eld to 10 mTthe top MAFO magnetization should switch to the positive direction whereas the bottom MAFO layershould not switch if there is no coupling through the LTO If there is strong ferromagnetic couplingbetween the two MAFO layers then the two magnetizations should be parallel A similar experimentcan be performed to see if the system prefers anti-alignment of the two ferromagnetic layers howeverthis e ect can be seen in the remanent mangetization after the magnetizations have been aligned by astrong eld PNR can easily determine the di erence between ferromagnetic antiferromagnetic and nocoupling in each of these scenarios as seen in Figure 1 Given that the LTO layer thickness is signi cantlysmaller than the London penetration depth  160 nm our PNR measurements will not be sensitive tothe magnetic eld expulsion when below the superconducting transition temperatureExperimental FeasibilityWe have calculated the spin asymmetry of two scenarios no coupling and strong coupling between thetwo MAFO layers in this eld con guration Figure 2 It is easily seen that there is a stark di erencebetween the two con gurations Even at lowQ the measurement is very sensitive to the relative alignmentof the two ferromagnetic layersExperimental Plan and Requested BeamtimeWe plan to measure two samples each with a cross-sectional area of 10

the MAFO layers To anti-align the two MAFO magnetizations we will apply a largenegative eld and then sweep the eld to 10 mT higher than the coercivity of the top MAFO layer butlower than that of the bottom MAFO layer Samples will be cooled to approximately 10 K in the 10mT eld Given the sample area and Q-range of interest we expect the rst measurement will require20  0 0  2 0  4 0  6 0  8 1  0- 0

request 5 days of beamtime on the PBR instrument at theNCNRPNR has proved an invaluable technique in our group for probing interfacial interactions that give riseto novel magnetic phases 2 We have also used PNR to investigate proximity-induced magnetism inMgAlFe2O4CoCr2O4 bilayers demonstrating the viability of the technique in this system  Ourgroup has also been granted beam time on the PBR
