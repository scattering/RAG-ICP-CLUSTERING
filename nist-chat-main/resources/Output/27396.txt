During processing and consumer use complex fluids often experience transient high-amplitude shearing flows The canonical measurement for understanding the fluid behavior under these conditions is large-amplitude oscillatory shear LAOS 1 In LAOS a fluid is confined between two surfaces where one surface is stationary and the other is allowed to oscillate back-and-forth see Figure 1 The fluid is subjected to a cosinusoidal shear rate  t   0 cost 1 where   angular frequency   shear rate 0  shear rate amplitude and t  time By measuring the stress response of the fluid we can determine the fluids physical properties relevant to processing For oscillatory shear to be large 0  1  which simulates many processing flows  Molecular models exist to deepen our understanding of the complex fluid stress response to LAOS The simplest relevant model for long thin molecules or micelles is the rigid dumbbell 34 When experiencing flow dumbbells adapt an orientation and this orientation is the source of all rheological property prediction Rigid dumbbell theory allows for the construction of a theoretical orientation distribution see Figure 2 that we can compare with orientation measurements These models provide an opportunity for us to improve product performance while removing the need for reformulation testing that wastes material and time Figure 1 Dilute suspension of rigid dumbbells undergoing oscillatory shear between two plates  Figure 2 Rigid dumbbell orientation distribution where red and blue parts correspond to highly probable and less likely orientations 2Despite the integral role that orientation plays in molecular modeling few studies exist with the purpose of exploring complex fluid orientation for the purpose of informing molecular models We aim to fill this hole by using small-angle neutron scattering SANS to determine fluid molecular orientation during different phases of oscillatory shear By doing so we can verify the predictions of molecular models that have until now gone untested PRELIMINARY RESULTS Until now there have been only a few studies of time-resolved LAOS neutron scattering showing the 2D scattering pattern at different times during an oscillatory cycle for polymers  and surfactant micelles  These studies focused on phase separation and shear banding in the sheared fluids without using the alignment information to evaluate theoretical orientation predictions from molecular models However Calabrese et al did analyze alignment information and found that micelle alignment was in-phase with shear rate or nearly so and had frequency-dependence for their particular solution  By in-phase we mean that the maximum alignment coincided with the maximum shear rate when t  n in Eq 1 In our previous work we found that some wormlike micelle solutions have alignment that is out-of-phase with the shear rate  This disagreement in alignment behavior for different micelle solutions necessitates further study We would like to expand on the limited alignment results of the previously discussed works to determine the effect of oscillating frequency ionic screening and surfactant choice on alignment Specifically we would like to reconcile the differing results of alignment studies to develop an overall understanding of micelle alignment during LAOS This study will also verify the accuracy of current molecular models and clarify the conditions for which they are suitable In our recent work rigid dumbbell theory orientation predictions were translated into theoretical light scattering patterns  allowing for comparison with scattering measurement see Figure 3 We will further develop this for neutron scattering We will use SASView to analyze the micelle alignment and morphology under different conditions Figure 3 Theoretical two-dimensional rigid dumbbell scattering pattern in LAOS  3EXPERIMENTAL PLAN We will use cetrimonium bromide CTABsodium salicylate NaSal wormlike micelles at two surfactantsalt ratios of 30 mM240 mM and 30 mM40 mM to determine the shear-induced alignment of micelles From this we can determine the micelle orientation during LAOS and compare with previous light scattering results By using a wormlike micelle system previously unstudied using rheo-SANS we can determine if previous findings can be generalized to other wormlike micelle systems We will also conduct a factorial analysis investigating the effect of oscillatory frequency We have done this for rheo-SALS measurements of 30 mM240 mM CTABNaSal solutions  where an increase in frequency can disrupt the phase relationship between alignment and shear rate  These measurements will require the use of a rheometer with a Couette geometry to be installed in the neutron beam We will measure the SANS q-range of 0002 -1 - 012 -1 to observe micelle alignment in each of 2 samples at 2-3 measurement frequencies This Q range can be covered by vSANS with one configuration without moving the detectors We expect that two hours for each measurement as we will analyze two dimensional data will be enough Including time for detector movement and rheometer setup we request 3 days of vSANS beamtime REFERENCES 1
