 Page 1 of 3 Softening of acoustic phonons in GeSe-PbSe thermoelectrics Chengjie Mao Tyson Lanigan-Atkins Jingxuan Ding Mayank Gupta Xing He Shan Yang and Olivier Delaire Scientific Importance Thermoelectric materials are capable of converting heat into electricity which is expected to have great potential in energy generation and utilization The performance of thermoelectric materials is characterized by the figure of merit ZTS2Tlate where  is the electrical conductivity S is the Seebeck coefficient lat is the lattice thermal conductivity and e is the electronic thermal conductivity Lead chalcogenides make good thermoelectric materials because they have both high electronic power factors and low thermal conductivities PbTe-based materials show outstanding thermoelectric performance with ZT close to 0810 at 650K However the application of PbTe is limited due to the scarcity of the abundance of Te in the Earths crust which is only 150 the amount of Se Thus its appealing to investigate the potential of PbSe-based materials GeSe-alloyed n-type PbSe materials were recently reported to show remarkable thermoelectric performance As shown in Fig1 GeSe-alloyed PbSe exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity with a different temperature dependence compared to pure PbSe Strikingly GeSe-alloyed PbSe exhibits an abnormal increase of lattice thermal conductivity at high temperature First-principle calculations suggest that the off-centered Ge atoms not only exhibit unusually low frequency optical vibrations but also cause the nearest neighbor Pb atoms to soften significantly The reduced thermal conductivity of GeSe-alloyed n-type PbSe leads to an increased ZT maximum of 154 at 773 K and an average ZT of 114 in the 400 - 900 K range6- Comparing Fig 2left and Fig 2right1 the TA phonon slightly softens upon alloying PbSe with GeSe but the LA softens drastically with a 50 decrease in frequency seen at the X-point from first-principles calculation Fig 2 left Calculated phonon dispersion of undoped PbSe 1 right Phonon dispersion of GeSe-alloyed PbSe 1 Figure 1 Lattice thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for n-type Pb09955Sb00045Se-xGeSe 1 Page 2 of 3 Based on the calculated energy as function of the coordinate of Ge atoms the Ge atom is shifted away from the regular site along 111 direction by about 03  into an off-centered position Based upon first-principles simulations1 the interaction between these off-center Ge atoms with their nearest Se and next nearest Pb atoms is expected to be the reason of those low frequency modes shown in Fig 2right However there has no direct experimental data supporting this hypothesized mechanism Thus we propose to use BT-7 to get better understanding of phonon softening in GeSe-PbSe We expect to see a decrease in the frequencies of the acoustic phonon branches in Ge-doped PbSe compared with undoped PbSe The change in phonon frequency and linewidth could account for the decrease in thermal conductivity which indicates stronger anharmonicity in the GeSe-alloyed PbSe lattice Temperature-dependent triple-axis TAX measurements would provide solid experimental data for understanding this scattering and the soft modes generated from the doping of Ge atoms Preliminary Work Crystal quality of the samples has verified with Laue We have performed extensive first-principles simulations of PbSe and are currently calculating phonon dispersions for the GeSe-doped compound We can then use our in-house code to simulate SQE which we use to guide our neutron measurements We have extensive previous experience measuring PbTe similar scattering lengths and structure factors to PbTe which we have used to estimate measurement times Experiment Plan We propose to measure single-crystalline samples of PbSe and Ge006SePb1-006Se using BT-7 Measuring the doped and undoped system will help us to extract robust trends Fig 2right of the softening of phonon branches with respect to doping We will measure phonons from 0-7meV and use Ef  147meV We will measure along the high symmetry directions where softening was in the calculations of Zhong-Zhen et al1 for both compounds Based on our simulation of SQE this system shows relative high intensity at 200 Q point Thus in order to capture the soft modes with good intensity we would like to do the measurements along HH0 and H00 plane  These Q points could be reached with Ef147 meV The temperature dependence of phonon frequencies reflects anharmonic components in the interatomic potential which we use to assess traditional models -such as the quasi-harmonic approximation QHA- but also more advanced models taking into account intrinsic anharmonicity 21 This will allow us to quantify the extent of anharmonicity in these two systems We will perform ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD simulations as a function of temperature which directly incorporate anharmonicity and compare the resulting phonon dispersions to experiment Based on our previous experience of measuring PbTe each sample will cost roughly 25 days and considering time for sample changing and temperature changing we estimate 6 to 7 days for the experiment in total Samples We have large 15g single crystals of PbSe which have been aligned in the HHL allowing us access to the many of the symmetry directions where the soft modes are predicted in 1 Our collaborators have grown large single crystals of the GeSe-doped PbSe which will also be aligned in the HHL plane The stability of the doped-samples have been confirmed up to at least 900K where PbSe has a known melting point of 1350K Safety Considerations This experiment does not pose a significant safety concern Since the samples contain Pb they will be handled with gloves at all time but do not pose any other significant safety issues in single-crystal form Figure 3 Relative energy as function of the coordinate of doping Ge atom Page 3 of 3
