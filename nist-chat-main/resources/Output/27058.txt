045  to capture the micelle morphological changes in each of 40 samples Including time for temperature changes we request 3 days of VSANS beamtime Additionally we hope to discover the mechanism aggregation swelling etc that contributes to suspension instability using USANS To cover the q-range of interest in USANS six hours should be sufficient for each temperature and concentration condition We thus request 6 days of USANS time in addition to VSANS beamtime REFERENCES 1Torosantucci R B Furtmann B Elshorst S Pfeiffer-Marek T Hartleb N Andres and T Bussemer Protein-excipient interactions evaluated via nuclear magnetic resonance studies in polysorbate-based multidose protein formulations influence on antimicrobial efficacy and potential study approach Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 107 2531-2537 2018 2 Meyer BK A Ni B Hu and L Shi Antimicrobial preservative use in parenteral products past and present Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 9612 3155-3167 2007 3 Shuai S Z Chen JM Rizzo A Semple S Mittal JK Cheung D Richardson V Antochshuk and M Shameem A highly sensitive method for the quantitation of polysorbate 20 and 80 to study the compatibility between polysorbates and m-cresol in the peptide formulation Journal of Analytical  Bioanalytical Techniques 63 100024 2015 4 Aizawa H Morphology of polysorbate 80 Tween 80 micelles in aqueous 14-dioxane solutions Journal of Applied Crystallography 42 592-596 2009 5 Aizawa H Effect of increasing NN-dimethylformamide concentration on the structure of polysorbate 80 micelles The Open Chemical Physics Journal 3 6-9 2011 6 Aizawa H Morphology of polysorbate 80 Tween 80 micelles in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide solutions Journal of Applied Crystallography 43 630-631 2010
