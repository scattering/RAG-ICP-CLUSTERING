Structure Formation in Dense Gels of Cellulose and Ionic Liquid Doug Henderson1 Xin Zhang1 Yimin Mao12 Robert M Briber1 Howard Wang1 1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Maryland College Park MD 2 NCNR NIST Gaithersburg MD Background Molecular cellulose solutions MCS have been fabricated by dissolving cellulose in a binary solvent mixture of ionic liquid EMIMAc and dimethylsulfoxide DMSO based on work done in Rein et al1 To create neat cellulose films from solution DMSO is removed using a vacuum oven after which a dense gel of cellulose and ionic liquid remains with a unique multi-scale ordered structure EMIMAc is removed by soaking with acetone followed by ethanol and as the cellulose composition increases the structural ordering in the gel changes These solvents have been shown to have different effects on the structure of the gels throughout the soaking process Extensive small and wide angle x-ray scattering SAXS WAXS measurements have been conducted in order to characterize this structure Figure 1 shows the SAXS data obtained for these gels with increasing cellulose content as EMIMAc is removed A prominent ordering peak is observed at about Q  002 -1 As EMIMAc is removed during acetone washing Figure 1A the peak shifts to a higher Q and decreases in intensity During ethanol washing Figure 1B the peak shifts slightly to higher Q and intensity increases Figure 1 SAXS data of celluloseEMIMAc gels throughout A acetone soaking process and B ethanol soaking process This ordering peak likely corresponds to a periodic distance between scattering objects During EMIMAc removal the distance between these objects decreases The periodic distance changes with the concentration following a 57  5612 dependence indicating that it is shrinking in 2 dimensions and therefore is 1-dimensional or rod-like These gels are also ordered at the local scale with a large peak at 8 degrees corresponding to a d-spacing of about 11 nm As the gel is washed with acetone the peak increases in intensity then as its washed with ethanol the peak collapses The overall structure of this gel system consists of multiscale ordering at both the local and longer-range scales This local ordering peak corresponding to D  11 nm observed in WAXS indicates a potential crystal complex with cellulose and EMIMAc since the ordering diminishes as EMIMAc is removed The longer range ordering 30 nm observed in SAXS corresponds to the periodic distance between dense regions containing crystal clusters of the 11 nm scale ordering Acetone likely cannot penetrate the dense ordered regions so preferentially A B removes EMIMAc from the amorphous region between clusters corresponding to a decrease in periodic distance and a shift to higher Q Ethanol will remove the remaining EMIMAc largely present in the dense ordered regions causing the local ordering to collapse In SAXS the periodic distance does not change significantly since it is now almost pure cellulose however the intensity increases This could indicate void formation as the EMIMAc is removed however further investigation is required Using small angle neutron scattering SANS and contrast matching we can investigate the presence of voids and also probe the structure within the ordered regions by more accurately estimating the composition in each phase Figure 2 below is a schematic illustrating this multi-scale ordering structure Experiment and Analysis Plan A large cellulose film will be prepared according to the following procedure MSC fabricated from 6 cellulose 11 EMIMAc and 83 DMSO Solution will be cast in a large dish and placed in a vacuum oven for 1 week to evaporate DMSO The remaining gel of cellulose and EMIMAc will be soaked repeatedly with Acetone for a total of 5 soakings each 24 hours in length with controlled drying between soaks to limit wrinkling in the film Mass will be monitored throughout soaking and when no change in mass is measured after soaking acetone is no longer an effective solvent Half the film will be removed for measurement The remaining film will then be soaked in ethanol to remove the remaining EMIMAc for a total of 10 soaks each lasting 24 hours with controlled drying between soaks Mass will be monitored throughout the soaking process in order to assert that the final film contains minimal EMIMAc This will be supported by using FTIR measurements The remaining cellulose film will be measured For each of the two samples there are two phases- the amorphous domains and the dense ordered domains Each phase will contain a different composition of EMIMAc and cellulose and thus will have different scattering length densities SLD that can be matched This measurement will follow a related SANS experiment which will determine ideal ratios of hydrogenateddeuterated HD acetone and ethanol with which to measure the samples in USANS With different contrast sources larger scale structures may become visible at low-Q that were not yet observed Thus 4 samples will be measured cellulose gel after full acetone soaking immersed in an HD solvent matching both the amorphous and ordered phases as determined by SANS and the cellulose gel after full ethanol soaking with similar HD solvent matching conditions Each sample will also be measured without solvent Beam Time Request Roughly 6 hours will be needed for each measurement with 4 total dry sample measurements 4 sample measurements immersed in HD solvent mixtures of acetone or ethanol as well as background solvent measurements empty cell and block beam This totals 12 measurements We request 3 days of beam time on USANS to conduct the proposed experiment This USANS experiment is being proposed as a complementary experiment to a SANS experiment It is possible that with different contrast sources additional larger scale structures may become visible at lower scattering angles Reference 1 Rein Dmitry M et al True molecular solutions of natural
