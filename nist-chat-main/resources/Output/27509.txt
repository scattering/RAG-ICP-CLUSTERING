Gelatinization of Polysaccharides Howard Wang Xin Zhang Robert M Briber Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Maryland College Park MD 20742 It is desirable to understand design and control the pathway of food preparation and consumption for the benefit of human health 1 Gelatinization occurs when starchwater mixtures are heated and lamellar stacking of side chains of amylopectin melts2 The transport and distribution of water among polysaccharide molecules plays a key role in the process of gelatinization Small angle scattering has become an indispensable tool for understanding the structure changes in several levels of hierarchical structures3 Our previous in situ measurements imply the role of porosity and capillarity in initial water uptake Figure 1 shows USANS on a corn starch in heavy water heating from the room temperature to 100 oC The sudden drop of scattering intensity at ca 60 oC implies a 1st order like transition such as melting This transition corresponds to the loss of the correlation peak of lamellar stacking at ca 007 A-1 characterizing the occurrence of gelatinization While the structural behavior in the regime of 1 to 10s nanometers has attached more attention in previous studies the evolution of structures at 100s nm to micron scales during gelatinization has not been known well We will continue the in situ USANS study and extend the understanding of starch gelatinization at micron scale through tuning the interfacial tension between polysaccharides and the immersing liquid Measurements To tune the surface tension of the immersing liquid mixtures of water and alcohol will be prepared at compositions 20 mol apart allowing for accessing surface tensions from 22 mNm for pure ethanol to 73 mNm f pure water Both deuterated water and ethanol will be used in this study All samples will be prepared at a fixed corn starch concentration of 25 by mass in the liquid A total of 6 starch samples and an empty cell will be measured using the BT5 USANS instrument covering the Q-range from 000004 to 00026 A-1 USANS will be measured at temperatures 293 K 323 K 333 K 353 K and 373 K for all samples and after cooling down to 293 K for all samples Through fitting low temperature spectra using the power law and high temperature ones with Guinier law we will carefully examine the effect of surface tension of the immersing liquid on wetting and gelatinization Particularly we will study the nature of gelatinization transition whether it is a true thermodynamic transition or convoluted with kinetics and histories Results from this study will allow for a better understanding of the gelatinization of polysaccharides Beam Time Request To measure all 6 samples at 6 temperatures assuming 4 hours for each measurement a total of 144 hours is needed Addition time is needed to cover the empty cell temperature equilibration and sample changing We request 7 days of USANS beamtime To complement USANS measurements 2 days of SANS beam time is also requested Figure 1 USASN on corn starch in water heating from room temperature to 100 oC The scattering intensity dropped drastically upon heating above ca 60 oC implying 1st order like phase transition behavior References 1 A C Dona et al Digestion of starch In vivo and in vitro kinetic models used to characterize oligosaccharide or glucose release Carbohydrate Polymers 80 2010 599-617 2 T A Waigh et al Side-chain liquid-crystalline model for starch Starch 52 2000 450-460 3 E P Gilbert Small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering in food colloids Current Opinion in Colloid  Interface Science 42 2019 55-72
