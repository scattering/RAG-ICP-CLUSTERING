Dielectric rheoUSANS analysis of nanoparticle aggregation relevant to treatment of the Hanford Wastes Paul ben Ishai Lawrence M Anovitz Javen Weston Katherine Weigandt Jaehun Chun and Paul Butler Scientific Importance The United States currently houses over 200 million liters of radioactive legacy waste at the Hanford Site near Richland WA This waste is chemically complex as it is the result of three different plutonium separation processes and consists of saltcake solids sludge and supernatant liquid in a highly alkaline and radioactive environment  Understanding predicting and manipulating chemical speciation and interfacial dynamics in such complex environments are central challenges for environmental management and energy technologies The US government currently spends 6B dollars annually managing Cold War legacy contamination The US Department of Energy DOE projects that retrieval of the tank materials and subsequent processing will require at least fifty years and hundreds of billions of dollars DOE 2014 This will consist of separating high-level waste HLW that will be vitrified for final storage from low-activity waste LAW The saltcake solids and supernatant LAW are expected to behave well during removal from the tanks The sludge HLW however consists of water and insoluble solids whose nonuniformity and refractory nature complicates aggregation and therefore removal  The sludge is comprised of several metal oxides and hydroxides but a large portion is boehmite -AlOOH Materials located within the tanks have also been subjected to about 70 years of ionizing radiation which has led to significant changes Some have been investigated and characterized by  for synthetic boehmite which will be used during these experiments It was found that while the bulk of the material was relatively stable under ionizing radiation the surface was quite prone to damage and generally showed surface reduction It was also noted but not characterized that irradiated material charged differently than pristine material  This work is ongoing and the effects of radiation on aggregation in solutions of various pHs and cation concentrations are being evaluated from completed USANS experiments Data obtained to date including tumbler USANS Anovitz et al 2019 in progress Huestis et al in progress rheoUSANS Weston et al in subm and capillary USAXS

radiation likely change the nature of particle-particle interactions and therefore suspension rheology Particle-particle interactions are fundamental to the rheological properties of a slurry so understanding the microstructures and forces associated with particle-particle interactions is key to understanding the rheological response  However rheology represents only part of the story In such slurries the interaction between agglomerate particles is mediated by the interaction with the aqueous background itself a complex ionic structure In fact this interaction permeates multiple scales Fidel-Dufour Gruy and Herri 2005 leading to fractal-like relaxation behaviors In order to probe this background Dielectric Spectroscopy DS can be used as a technique complimentary to rheology  In particular DS can be very sensitive to percolative processes of charge movement  1 through fractured environments much like those existing between agglomerate particles By correlating the percolation involved - and its subsequent fractal environment - and the structures observable simultaneously using USANS to the rheology we hope to offer a more detailed picture of how dissolution times a continuing problem for boehmite 1 and rheological properties can be manipulated In order to carry out such a simultaneous study we propose to use a unique device currently available at NISTNCNR The rheometer at NIST has been modified to carry out simultaneous measurements of rheology Dielectric Spectroscopy and SANS in the same sample cell The advantage of such a measurement is that both macroscopic Rheology mesoscopic DS and microscopic SANS elements of the structure and behavior can be analyzed This proposal therefore requests time for dielectric rheoUSANS measurements on both the VSANS and USANS instruments We realize that at this time modifications would need to be made to the USANS instrument to achieve the latter measurements To date our largest changes but not all have been observed in the USANS region such measurements are therefore needed but as the dielectric properties will be a function of solution composition solid concentration and shear the dielectric part of the measurement need only be made in the VSANS and complementary USANS measurements need not involve DS As shown by our previous studies there are a number of variables that effect the aggregation and rheological properties of a boehmite suspension These include pH total solid irradiation solid concentration ionic strength cation size and charge and anion type Obviously we cannot investigate all of the important variables in a single experiment Therefore and based on our previous work we will investigate a limited but important subset for this partly developmental experiment We will focus on a 5 wt percent boehmite solution at pH 7 10 and 13 using NaOH to fix the hydroxide concentrations Samples will be both measured for a starting mixture and pre-spun at a fixed shear rate to determine changes and equilibrium values in the structural and dielectric properties as a function of shear time Experiments will also be conducted during shear to observe changes in the DS response Shear rates will vary over the accessible range of the instrument 0-3000 sec-1 and both ascending speeding up and descending slowing down sequences will be evaluated Figure 3 - Percolation in a BBO crystal melt The dc conductivity  of a BBO crystal melt at high temperatures The sample is an frustrated ionic liquid with BO3 chains impeding the free ion movement see inset B-O bonds represented by the lines while the dots represent ionic motion of Ba2ions  s dc exhibits a typical power law dependence  in this case temperature driven with a percolation temperature of Tc1184 K and a critical exponent of 028 The low value of the exponent indicates a dynamic percolation The open circles are the derivative of sdc and reveal a further critical phase transition at T 876 K where the fractality of the melt is once again reflected in a change of the exponent to 031 Dielectric measurements The dielectric setup available to us at NISTNCNR allows measurements of the impedance between the inner drum and the outer cup in a frequency widow of 1 Hz to 10 MHz Impedance measurements can be converted to the dielectric permittivity of the system as  where is the cyclic frequency is the geometric capacity of the empty cell is the measured complex impedance and are the real and imaginary components respectively The high alkalinity of the background will present challenges as at low frequencies it should lead to the formation of charged double layers at the electrodesample interface 1 However the mechanical strain imposed by concurrent rheological measurements will reduce this effect leaving a usable frequency window for analysis We expect that dc conductivity an inherent part of the dielectric permittivity  will exhibit power law behavior see figure 3 indicative of percolative charge movement In this case is described by for and for  where is the driving thermodynamic parameter temperature or component concentration Here the exponent reflects the nature of percolation static or dynamic and can be related to the spatial fractal dimension of the system By understanding the critical percolation concentration  as it relates to the rheology and USANS microstructure we hope to understand the nature and manipulation of agglomeration in these systems The example in figure 3 shows the situation in a BaB2O4 melt Here the melt is an ionic liquid where charge motion of Ba2 ions is frustrated by bonded B-0 illustrated in the inset The results are for the derived dc conductivity  where is the permittivity of free space and is the cyclic frequency and show typical power law percolative behavior The derivative open circles indicates a subtle phase change Dc conductivity is the static limit of any charge motions and in an ionic system the transient nature of ionic motions lead to sizable dielectric responses Although the contribution of to the imaginary component of the dielectric permittivity  may be dominant it does not contribute to the real part  As the mechanical stress induced by concurrent rheology should remove any double layer contribution to the response these transients should accessible in the real part of the dielectric permittivity For each condition VSANS experiments are expected to take 2 hours We therefore request 3 days of beam time on the VSANS instrument USANS measurements are expected to take approximately 10 hours We therefore request 12 days of USANS time for this experiment References  Anovitz L M Zhang X Soltis J A Nakouzi E Krzysko A J Chun J et al 2018 Effects of Ionic Strength Salt and pH on Aggregation of Boehmite Nanocrystals
