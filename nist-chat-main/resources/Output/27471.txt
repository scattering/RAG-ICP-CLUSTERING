Nanoparticles NPs assemble at wateroil interfaces to reduce the interfacial tension The NPs form disordered liquid-like assemblies where the NPs are mobile in the plane of the interface The energy holding the NPs at the interface is of the order of several kBT kBT  4  1021 J at 300 K This low binding energy of the NPs leads to an exchange between the NPs at the interface and those dispersed in the medium Increasing the capillary energy that binds the particles to the interface such as by generating particles of inhomogeneous surface chemistry at the oil-water interface irreversibly anchors the particles to the interface This permanent attachment of the NPs to the interface allows us to use the liquid-liquid interface to structure all-liquid systems into complex shapes and the functionality of the NPs and their assemblies to impart unique characteristics eg conductivity or plasmonic behavior Recently we uncovered a very unusual characteristic of the assembly of paramagnetic NPs MNPs to a fluid interface A droplet Fig 1 of an aqueous dispersion of Fe3O4-CO2H MNPs immersed in an immiscible liquid eg toluene is a paramagnetic ferrofluid FF After adding amine-modified polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane POSS-NH2 ligands to the surrounding oil phase the attractive electrostatic interactions between ligands and MNPs result in the formation of MNP-surfactants MNPSs By changing the shape of the droplet with an external field the interfacial area increases and more MNPSs form and assemble at the interface between the oil and water Upon removal of the field the interfacial area decreases to minimize energy and the MNPSs jam at the interface locking in the shape Any reduction in the volume of the droplet as for example the dissolution of the water in the oil or evaporation of the water will also jam the MNPSs The remarkable finding that has emerged is that the jammed monolayer of MNPSs converts the FF droplet into a ferromagnetic liquid magnetic droplet Magnetic hysteresis loop Fig 1b as measured by vibrating sample magnetometer VSM of an FF droplet in which the MNPs have a non-zero saturation magnetization Ms dependent on the total number of MNPs a negligible coercive field Hc and zero remanent magnetization Mr The addition of POSS-NH2 to the toluene leads to a jamming of the MNPSs at the interface and the resultant magnetic hysteretic and ferromagnetic behavior Fig 1b red dots Both curves shown in Figure 1b are obtained with the same FF droplet prior to and after jamming While the total number of MNPs is the same same Ms an Mr 810-5 emu and Hc 90 Oe were found The dipole moment imparted to the FF droplet is retained by the magnetized monolayer of jammed MNPSs and remains until the droplet is re-magnetized with a field exceeding the switching field or the assembly is unjammed Figure 1 Figure 2 Perhaps a more startling finding are the hysteresis loops of single jammed aqueous droplets with 05 g L-1 of MNPs at pH 45 immersed in a 10 g L-1 solution of POSS-NH2 in toluene and hysteresis loops of the same system after being sonicated D Remanent Mr and saturation magnetization Ms of the droplets as a function of droplet volume The remanence ratio MrMs as a function of initial droplet volume single droplet or droplet sonicated into multiple smaller droplets remains constant at 025 This result argues that every MNP in the droplets contributes to remanent magnetization ie the magnetization of the jammed MNPs at the interface biases the magnetization of the MNPs that are dispersed in the droplet It is precisely this propagation of the magnetization from the MNPs jammed at the interface to the MNPs dispersed in the liquid that is of interest to the proposed polarized neutron reflectivity studies Here we propose using small-angle neutron scattering to directly survey the nearest neighbor coupling between nanoparticles Note that proximity alone is unexpected to impart a net ferromagnetic character to the assembly refs such that polarization along the surfactant may play a role In addition neutron spin polarization analysis would allow us to measure the intrinsic magnetization length scales ranging from single to multi particle couplings even when the net magnetization measured by SQUID is zero We propose measuring and contrasting 10 cm diameter droplets stacked to a total thickness of 2 mm and composed of 22 nm diameter magnetite nanoparticles in the following two forms A jammed via an applied magnetic field and B jammed in a zero magnetic field via a change in PH Deuterated solvents will be used to reduce incoherent background scattering The proposed SANS measurements would be 1 Nearly zero field 0001T to maintain a polarized beam on sample A 2 Saturating field 1 T om sample A 3 Return to nearly zero field on sample A 4 -H_C on sample A 5 Nearly zero field on sample B Measurements 1 3 and 5 would provide detailed information about the morphology and extent of intrinsic magnetic domain formation of the jammed assemblies details to follow Measurement 2 would reveal whether jamming fully constrains the nanoparticle movement as postulated Perhaps most importantly measurement 4 would probe the unexpected yet energetically favorable magnetic structures that allow normally paramagnetic NPs to sustain ferromagnetic responses Variation between 1 and 5 would indicate whether the magnetic domains are larger than those created without the presence of an external guiding field perhaps antiferromagnetic stripes Comparison between 3 and 5 would indicate whether field training after jamming in fundamentally different that training the occurs while the nanoparticles are free to move Taken together the aim is to understand what mechanism allows these paramagnetic nanoparticles to form ferromagnetic structures in the jammed state Each measurement is expected to take approximately 12 hours using VSANS 15 hours each non spin-flip 45 hours each spin-flip with 55  neutrons detector distances of 1 m and 18 m Combined with beamline set-up and an empty cell measurements of one SF and one NSF state this requires total of 3 days This proposal is submitted in conjunction another reflectometry proposal which will search for depth dependent magnetic variations between surface jammed nanoparticles and interior fluid-like nanoparticles as a function of droplet thickness
