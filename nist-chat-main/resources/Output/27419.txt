 Page 1 of 3 Statement of Research Scientific Importance Frustrated magnetic materials with competing interactions have proven a fertile arena for the discovery of novel emergent phenomena In these systems frustration disturbs the development of conventional long-range order down to very low temperatures leading to many exotic phases of matter such as classical and quantum spin liquids SL Consequently it is expected that in SL candidates competing interactions lead to degenerate states providing a rich platform to investigate novel emergent phenomena such as fractional excitations Significant attention has been focused on understanding geometric frustration in rare-earth compounds In these systems the subtle interplay between frustration due to the geometry of the lattice and the spin-orbit coupling as well as crystal field anisotropy of the rare earth ion can lead to a variety of rich emergent phenomena Most exotic cases of geometrically frustrated quantum magnets can be found in two-dimensional systems such as Kagome and triangular lattices In fact decades ago an original SL state was proposed for a triangular lattice TL Heisenberg antiferromagnet with single magnetic ion per unit cell and though later a magnetically ordered state was suggested as the ground state of such a system the possibility of SL has maintained to be a leading hypothesis in a broader framework For instance a recently reported theoretical phase diagram for TL system proposes to host a new SL phase which is connected to a previously predicted phase  Concurrently many experimental efforts have been focused on designing and synthesizing new materials with a perfect TL and in particular several families of compounds with rare earth TLs have attracted much attention recently 2- One such family of systems we are interested is rare-earth TL compounds Ba3Ln11BO33 with LnYb BYBO Tb BTBO Er BEBO and Ho BHBO  Crystal structure of BTBO R -3 space group is different compared to compounds in the family P63mmc BTBO consist of ABCABC stacking along the crystallographic c-axis similar to YbMgZnGaO4 SL candidates Spacing between Tb1 ions layers are shorter compared to YbMgZnGaO4 In addition Tb2 ions share the same atomic site with Ba1 ions The detailed crystal structure of BTBO is shown in Figure 1 So far to the best of our knowledge there is no report on neutron scattering measurements on BLnBO systems Preliminary Work Motivated by the recent proposed theoretical phases as well as reported results collected on rare-earth TL compounds such as YbMgZnGaO4 in single crystal form as well as similar work performed on other compounds in polycrystalline form 2- we have synthesized the rare-earth TL compounds Ba3Ln11BO33 with LnYb BYBO Tb BTBO Er BEBO and Ho BHBO- where 10B isotope has been substituted with 11B isotope to minimize neutron absorption For BYBO we performed neutron powder diffraction measurements at the BT1 powder diffractometer at NCNR and no long-range magnetic ordering is observed down to the lowest accessible temperature of 80 mK We show in Figure 3 magnetic susceptibility and inverse susceptibility as a function of temperature collected for constant applied field of 001 T using BTBO powder sample No long range ordering was observed down to 300 mK The Curie-Weiss fits to the magnetic susceptibility measurements result in cw  -805 K Figure

BHBO powder samples Figure 3 shows the selected plots of inelastic neutron scattering data at 0 T and 5 K for all the samples We have identified all the crystal field excitation level of these magnetic systems Additionally BTBO sample shows interesting behavior at low energies reminiscent of that has been observed in other QSL candidates such as YbMgZnGaO4  and NaYbO2  It shows a continuum excitation up to 3 meV and another low energy mode around 5 meV which is slightly suppressed at 30 K Additionally Q dependence of the integrated intensity of low energy excitations show an interesting Q modulation as shown in Figure 3d However due to background scattering observed for Ei 12 meV at SEQUIOA and given it is not optimized to study very low energy excitations we need to investigate those features with higher statistics and with an instrument with good resolution and flux optimized for lower energy transfers at a lower temperature for more details We have grown single crystal sample of BTBO and the Laue diffraction pattern as shown in Figure 2 reveals a single domain Therefore we would like to investigate the low energy excitations of BTBO system with a single crystal sample at 300 mK using an instrument optimized for low energy excitations Choice of Instrument For this experiment we need to use the beamline DCS as we will need to look at low energy transfers with better resolution to measure the low energy excitations from the ground state that we observed with our powder samples using SEQUIOA DCS will also allow us to access the low temperature needed to probe the ground state T  350 mK Figure 2 X-Ray Laue diffraction pattern and photo of single crystal sample of Ba3Tb11BO33 Figure 3 Inelastic neutron scattering measurement results of Ba3Tb11BO33

exotic physical phenomena in these systems we propose to continue the studies to study the low energy excitations observed in BTBO system using the grown single crystal samples of BTBO We already aligned the single crystal sample  15 g in HK0 scattering plane on a copper mount appropriate for the magnets available at NCNR NIST As with the study of any possible SL phase measuring the low-lying excitations with high resolution is critical to detecting and characterizing possible continuums of excitations from exotic states such as due to spinons for example Furthermore the behavior of the low-lying excitations in applied magnetic field can reveal much about the low-temperature physics of the system In particular measuring the system in the polarized state yields important information about the exchange parameters and g-factors in the system For these measurements which would include a high temperature background and a number of applied fields we estimate we would require 7 days of
