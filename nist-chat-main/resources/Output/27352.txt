Identification of spin fluctuation direction of dynamic stripes in La2-xSrxCuO4 x012 The high-temperature superconducting cuprates display intriguing physical phenomena due to the presence of competing or intertwined phases In recent years the existence of charge density wave CDW and spin density wave SDW ordering has been observed across the various families of cuprates The La2CuO4-based family is a canonical example where both the spin and charge orders form stripes which are especially stable near 18 doping 2- Extensive neutron scattering measurements have revealed the static SDW ordering in both Sr-doped La2-xSrxCuO4 LSCO system and La2CuO4y with excess oxygen doping Strikingly via high resolution elastic neutron scattering experiment the SDW wave vectors in stage 4 La2CuO4y were found to be rotated by 3from the Cu-Cu direction  which is labelled the Y-shift  This observation of shifted peak positions indicates that the magnetic ordering need not lie along high-symmetry directions of the underlying CuO2 plane Subsequently a similar Y-shift was observed in the SDW of LSCO x012  see Fig1 Recently x-ray scattering of the CDW order was reported in the LSCO system and the Y-shift was observed in the charge degrees of freedom for the first time  The wave vectors have a simple relationship of charge2spin consistent with the stripe picture where the periodicity of the spin order is twice that of the charge order The common Y-shift implies that within a stripe model the stripes are indeed slanted However the ordering temperatures for the static SDW and CDW are different the ordering temperature for the SDW order TSDW coincides with the superconducting transition temperature Tc while the CDW order has apparently higher transition temperature TCDW than Tc There are only incipient spin fluctuations coexisting with the CDW order above Tc Just recently we successfully observed the existence of Y-shift in the spin fluctuation regime in LSCO x012 using high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering see Fig 2 The Y-shift exists in the inelastic channel up to at least 90K which is much higher than TSDW and close to TCDW This new finding not only confirms the ubiquity of this true incommensurability the Y-shift but also raise new question regarding the nature of the spin fluctuations once we take into account the structural twinning LSCO x012 undergoes a structural phase transition from high-temperature tetragonal HTT structure to low-temperature orthorhombic LTO structure at Tst250K Due to the twinning of the orthorhombic crystal there could be four twin domains below Tst as shown in Fig 3a By measuring the nuclear Bragg peaks we confirmed that there are four twin domains in our sample with similar populations However for both elastic and inelastic spin peaks we only observed contributions from two out of four twin domains For the elastic SDW peaks the missing contributions can be explained by two reasons First if the spin direction is along the orthorhombic b direction then only two out of the four domains satisfy the neutron selection rule ie having spin direction perpendicular to the wave vector Q Fig 3b Second if there is correlation between neighboring CuO2 planes then a special 3D stacking arrangement of the spins can give destructive interference between neighboring planes and result in nearly zero intensity for half of the four domains Both of these two factors have been confirmed to play a role in La2CuO4y with excess oxygen doping and elastic scattering measurements are underway to clarify the spin direction and 3D stacking in LSCO x012 It is much more difficult to understand the missing inelastic peaks If we assume the elastic and inelastic signals are originated from the same microscopic region of the sample then one explanation is that the spin fluctuation should be longitudinal In this case the dynamic spin stripes cannot be described by the ordinary spin waves picture which only contains transverse fluctuations Other explanations are equally novel involving microscopic phase separation or the presence of 3D stacking correlations at high temperatures To sort through these interesting implications it is critical to identify the direction of the spin fluctuations Neutron polarization analysis is a powerful tool which can directly extract this information Therefore we propose to conduct an inelastic scattering experiment with polarized neutrons BT-7 instrument is the ideal spectrometer to carry out this proposed experiment Utilization of 3He polarizers provide relatively less flux reduction compared to Heusler crystals Together with the high-flux thermal neutron provided by BT-7 we believe this measurement has a high likelihood of success We will use the single crystal of LSCO x012 from previous experiment with a mass of 128g The sample will be mounted in the HK0 plane We will start with the unpolarized beam and measure the spin fluctuation peaks around 05 05  with a series of judiciously chosen energy transfers to obtain the energy evolution of the Y-shift which will complete the previous characterization of the Y-shift phenomenon and also provide an intensity reference for the subsequent polarization measurement Then we will switch to the polarized setting with neutron polarization along z-direction out-of-plane direction and focus on energy transfer of 18 meV If there are longitudinal fluctuations the scattering will only show up in the spin-flip SF channel while the transverse fluctuation will only appear in the non-spin-flip NSF channel In this way we will directly identify the direction of the spin fluctuations Since the expected peak intensity can be quite low especially for the polarized beam we estimate 8 days of beamtime would be necessary to get sufficient statistics for this experiment This study will identify the direction of the spin fluctuations and provide important information on the nature of the spin fluctuations in this important correlated electron system Through this work we expect to achieve an influential result that will advance our understanding of stripes order and its relationship with
