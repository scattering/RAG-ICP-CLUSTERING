Mexico State University Las Cruces NM 88003 USA Introduction Self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers in the presence of solvents forms ordered mesophase structures also known as mesophase and lyotropic liquid crystals LLCs Pluronic block copolymers are amphiphilic triblock copolymers of polyethylene oxide PEO and polypropylene oxide PPO By changing Pluronic concentration at a constant wateroil ratio a variety of mesophase structures such as lamellar reversenormal hexagonal gyroid and micellar cubic are obtained through self-assembly12 which are thermodynamically stable and have length scales in the order of 2-50 nm Recently we have shown that ultrafiltration membranes for water treatment can be obtained through mesophase templating3 Coating or printing of mesophases with 10-100 m thickness on a substrate is a critical step for membrane production through mesophase templating The coatingprinting process imposes a shear stress on the mesophase which can vary depending on the production rate More importantly if the mesophases have shear banding behavior the final membrane performance can highly be affected by the shear rate of coating process The small-angle neutron scattering SANS studies on mesophases in 1-2 plane will shed light on their structural variation under simple shear flow as well as structure-processability relationship Preliminary Results Mesophases look like a transparent paste where their flow is dependent on the rearrangement of micelles and grains Wall-slip in complex fluids makes the flow behavior dependent on the type of geometry and the domain size of flow field4 To study the slippage behavior of mesophases we performed a set of flow sweep experiments on mesophases using the parallel plate geometry with three different gap sizes of 08 1 and 12 mm of smooth parallel plate PP surface and with gap size of 08 mm of cross-hatched CH surface as shown in Fig 1a It can be seen that the flow behavior does not change with gap size and surface roughness Therefore we conclude that mesophase samples do not have slippage during flow measurements5 Fig 1b shows typical rheological behavior of some of mesopahses with lamellar L normal hexagonal H1 and reverse hexagonal H2 mesophases The measured values of the stress at low shear rates can be extrapolated to zero-shear rate and considered as yield stress point All flow curves are practically similar and show the viscoplastic behavior with yield stress However the yield stress values for a few lamellar samples are pretty low  1 Pa which may be considered as zero The lamellar samples overall show lower yield stresses than hexagonal ones which is attributed to the easier sliding of planes than cylinders The presence of stress plateau in the flow curves in the mid-shear rate regime may be an indication of shear banding in the mesophases5 1 Alexandridis P Olsson U Lindman B Macromolecules 28 7700-7710 1995 2 Alexandridis P Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci 1 490-501 1996 3

Amphiphilic Block CopolymerOilWater Mesophases 2 Shear banding see Fig 2ab is a state of instability in a homogeneous flow that results in the formation of coexisting bands with different shear rates6 Different factors may contribute to the origin of shear banding such as a competition between attractive interactions and the shear stress7 an underlying transition or alignment in structure as a result of shear8 and flow-concentration coupling79 The preliminary results suggest that shear banding is present in the flow of mesophases5 To confirm the shear banding the SANS studies in flow-velocity gradient should be investigated Research Gap Current data suggest that mesophases undergo shear banding during flow We hypothesize that the shear banding is due to the alignment in one of the bands Therefore if they are used to make membranes through subsequent polymerization as we have shown3 depending on the flow field the manufacturing process can induce a heterogeneity across the membrane thickness The possible heterogeneity in the alignment of structure can influence the performance of final membrane positively or negatively which needs further investigations As the first step therefore it is essential to reveal how the structure of different mesophases vary in the velocity gradient direction at different shear rates 6 Fielding SM J Rheol 60 821-834 2016 7 Divoux T

the structure - lamellar normal and reverse hexagonal and cubic mesophases - by varying the D2O-to-oil ratio 3515 47525 2030 and 1040 respectively10 Samples will be prepared at New Mexico State University NMSU and the structure has been confirmed with lab scale small-angle X-ray scattering SAXS instrument10 To have a complete picture of underlying microstructural changes during shear and presence of shear banding we will use very small-angle neutron scattering VSANS with the 1-2 shear cell to provide 2 orders of magnitude in q-range 0004 to 04 -1 The measurement could also be made on a 30 m SANS instrument but will likely need multiple detector distances and will suffer from lower flux requiring additional time The experiments will be done at 5 different shear rates 1 in very low shear rates below plateau in flow curve 3 in plateau regime close to beginning in the middle and at the end of plateau and 1 in shear rates higher than plateau regime Such shear rates depend on the pre-measured flow curve done at NMSU and are typically on the order of 10-4 210-3 10-2 1 and 102 s-1 At each shear rate the VSANS will be done on 6 locations across the gap see Fig 2c We estimate that each measurement will require at least 30 minutes Each sample will require a minimum of 30 measurements 5 shear rates and 6 positions and 4 different compositions will be studied Allowing for stress relaxation after loading and between measurements and establishment of steady state we expect that each sample will require 20-22 hours to measure With the addition of experiment set up and background measurements we request 4 days on the VSANS to complete the proposed experiment 10 Qavi S Foudazi R Soft Matter 15 5626-5637 2019 Fig 2 The difference between the velocity profile of a fluid a without
