Physical Chemistry University of Stuttgart Germany 2Institute of Material Science University of Stuttgart Germany Nanoporous materials are of high interest in molecular heterogeneous catalysis Confinement effects are expected which might allow for an increase of both catalyst activity and selectivity The understanding of the confinement effect is one of the main goals of the collaborative research center 1333 Molecular Heterogeneous Catalysis in Confined Geometries established at University of Stuttgart Within our group nanoporous inorganic and inorganicorganic materials are produced utilizing colloidal crystals of polymer nanoparticles Metal oxide inverse opals are fabricated by mineralizing a colloidal crystal and removing the polymer by a pyrolysis step In the study at hand we will investigate the formation of the zinc oxide layer in nanopores of a colloidal crystal and whether the ZnO nuclei form via homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation Matching the contrast between polystyrene particles and precursor solution enables to study the formation and growth of ZnO particles by time-resolved SANS measurements Different scattering patterns will allow for distinguishing the formation of ZnO particles inside pores or pore wall ie homo- or heterogeneous nucleation Motivation The use of nanoporous materials for molecular heterogeneous catalysis is of great interest for industrial applications  Anchoring an organometallic catalyst inside a nanoporous material enables high surface areas and high catalyst loadings When using nanoporous materials confinement effects are expected which might allow for an increase of both catalyst activity and selectivity Studying the role of confinement in catalysis is the main goal of the Collaborative Research Center CRC 1333 Molecular Heterogeneous Catalysis in Confined Geometries established at the University of Stuttgart Within the CRC 1333 our group is aiming to provide tailor-made nanoporous materials utilizing colloidal crystals of polymer nanoparticles These colloidal crystals are then either transferred into a porous polymer or an inverse opal Inverse opals are fabricated in two steps firstly a colloidal crystal is mineralized by means of a mild chemical bath deposition CBD with a methanolic ZnO precursor solution at 60 C  Finally the polymer is removed by a pyrolysis step leading to a metal oxide inverse opal Research topic During the mineralization via CBD with a methanolic ZnO precursor solution a granular ZnO layer inside the pores is formed The size of the ZnO granules and the thickness of the layer can be adjusted by the amount of H2O  10 wt and the number of deposition cycles 1-5 times 2h each Only a few reports about ZnO mineralization in confinement are published These studies have shown that confinement can affect the ZnO properties such as the crystallinity of the ZnO layer  Still there is no fundamental study which clarifies whether the mineralization process of ZnO in confinement proceeds via homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation Utilizing time-resolved TR-SANS and contrast variation we propose to study the nucleation and growth process of the ZnO layer inside the pores of a colloidal crystal Fig 1 During the so-called homogeneous nucleation ZnO nuclei are formed inside the pore and will grow above the critical super saturation Having contrast matched the nanoporous polystyrene and the methanolic ZnO precursor solution TR-SANS experiments should allow for tracking the process via the appearance of a spherical particle form factor Pq  On the other hand heterogeneous nucleation occurring directly on the pore surface would lead to the emergence of an additional structure factor contribution correlated to the average pore distance Fig 1 left In homogeneous nucleation spherical ZnO nuclei are formed within the pore which in TR- SANS experiments should translate in the appearance of spherical particle form factor Pq while in case heterogeneous nucleation right will occur on the pore wall should lead to the emergence of an additional structure factor contribution correlated to the average pore distance First results Polystyrene nanoparticles are synthesized via emulsion polymerization The particle suspension is gently dried to receive closed-packed colloidal crystals CC The particle size Fig 2 left is adjustable by the concentration of SDS The particles were characterized with DLS and SANS inlet confirming their spherical shape and monodispersity Furthermore the structure of colloidal crystals made of deuterated PS particles dPS-CC dPS  6421010 cm-2 and dparticle  110 nm  8 nm have been investigated without solvent and in d4-methanol CD3OD  5811010 cm-2 center as well as a mineralized sample in d4-methanol right using SANS As predicted from the difference in scattering contrast dPS-CCair2  401020 cm-4 and dPS-CCCD3OD2  04 the scattering intensity decreases strongly if the colloidal crystal of deuterated PS particles is infiltrated by d4-methanol As ZnO ZnO  4771010 cm- 2 is deposited on the pore wall the intensity slightly increases Fig 2 left Diameter of PS particles as a function of SDS concentration Center SANS The infiltration of colloidal crystals of deuterated polystyrene dPS-CC by d4-methanol leads to a strongly decrease of scattering intensity due to the difference in scattering contrast dPS-CCair versus dPS-CCCD3OD After the mineralization the intensity increases slightly left Proposed SANS-experiments To study whether the formation of ZnO particles in confinement proceeds via homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation TR-SANS measurements applying contrast matching are proposed As a prerequisite to study whether the ZnO particles are formed inside the pore or at the PS-CCmethanol surface contrast variation experiments will be performed using mixtures of d4h4-methanol for the precursor solution to match the scattering length density of hPS particles d 50nm hPS1411010 cm-2 Using the contrast matched sample mineralization is started by increasing the temperature to 60C following the formation of ZnO-particles by TR-SANS for 2h To study the development and growth of the ZnO-layer on the pore surface we will investigate the structural evolution during three consecutive deposition cycles Experiments q  A-10001 001 01 1Iq1e-51e-41e-31e-21e-11e01e11e21e31e4unmineralized dPS-CC in

precursor solution Thus we plan to vary the H2O concentration from 0 wt over 3 wt to 6 wt The scattering curves will be analyzed using the form and structure factor of spherical particles 4 and Porods decay for diffuse interfaces  which will provide the size and polydispersity of the formed ZnO particles and the SV of the CC in case a ZnO layer is formed In order to reduce the scattering contribution of the structure factor the mineralization process of a diluted suspension of PS particles in the contrast matched d4h4-methanolic precursor solution will be investigated for the first deposition cycle by TR-SANS measurements as well The experiments will be performed in Hellma cells 1 mm using a fine powder of the PS colloidal crystal or a suspension of the respective PS particles We will adjust three sample-to-detector distances and a wavelength of  6  which will provide us with a q-range of 00015  q-1  05 The number of TR-SANS experiments will be 43  122h per deposition cycle  24h Thereby the detected q-range will be adjusted with respect to formation rate and particle size The scattering of the samples before and at the end of deposition cycles 10230 min will be studied to get information on the overall structure Adding the time needed for the contrast variation and for calibration we ask for 48 hours of beam time at CHRNS-30m Literature  E B Anderson M R Buchmeiser
