Polymer Gelation in the Presence of Non-Crystallizing Polymers and Small Molecules Statement of Research Building upon a recent trip to NCNR to run rheo-SANS experiments in September 2019 the objective of this proposal is to use rheo-SANS to uncover fundamental mechanisms governing the structural development of semiconducting polymersmall-molecule nanocomposite solution gels under shear for organic solar cell OSC applications We recently discovered a novel gelation mechanism in regioregular poly3-hexylthiophenephenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester rr-P3HTPCBM solutions that proceeds through viscoelastic phase separation VPS to form hierarchical porous structure by interconnected semi-crystalline P3HT networks1 We found that this microstructure is not affected with the presence of PCBM or regiorandom-P3HT Rra-P3HT through the gel strength characterized by small amplitude oscillatory shear Furthermore when these VPS-induced gels are exposed to deformational shear strains we unexpectedly observe the crystallization of PCBM upon solution drying Such shear-induced crystallization of the small-molecule phase within polymer gel matrices is to the best of our knowledge unprecedented in the literature During our trip to NIST in September 2019 we found that P3HT gel networks formed via VPS adopt similar structures to those formed via nucleation and crystal growth previously reported in the literature Preliminary results also suggest rheo-SANS to be a promising approach to examine the effect of polymer and small molecule additives on P3HT gel network formation Because the addition of Rra-P3HT to rr-P3HT films has the potential to improve the mechanical flexibility without affecting electronic transport we propose to use rheo-SANS to monitor the rr-P3HT gel network structure under deformational shear strains in the presence of both Rra-P3HT and PCBM to understand the structural evolution of these composite systems Significance and Background Embedding crystals such as light-emitting quantum dots or those comprising organic semiconductors within polymer matrices is a powerful strategy in the field of optoelectronics to combine the unique properties of the individual components into a single device Controlling the morphology of these polymersmall-molecule nanocomposites has proven exceedingly difficult and is the most critical outstanding challenge limiting OSC performance2 Notably the small molecule phase within blended films is typically amorphous limiting its ability to transport photo-generated charges to the device electrodes One promising method to improve the morphology of OSC active layers is to control the solution structure prior to thin film deposition Extensively studied since 20013 conventional room-temperature gelation of rr-P3HT solutions has been found to proceed through the nucleation and growth of rr-P3HT fibrils which interconnect to form a percolated gel network Newbloom et al carried out SANS experiments on a P3HT organogel with a concentration of 30 mgmL in deuterated solvents such as D10-p-xylene D8-toluene and D6-benzene A q-range of 0002 to 02 -1 was used In the q-range of 001 to 02 all rr-P3HT samples were analyzed as three component systems of solvent dissolved polymer chains and fibers with rectangular cross-section A combined model that includes a parallelepiped form factor for the fibers and a form factor for polymer chains with excluded volume interactions for the dissolved polymer The Fig 1 The G and G of a RR-P3HTPCBM solution in O-DCB as a function of shear strain g

total volume fraction of P3HT in the original solution v to determine the cross-sectional dimensions of the fiber a and b and to account for the fraction of rr-P3HT that exists in fiber form f at any instant The scattering intensity I can be described as a function of the scattering vector q as follows where is the scattering contrast between rr-P3HT fibers and solvent is the scattering contrast between dissolved P3HT chains and solvent is the parallelepiped form factor and is the form factor for polymer chains with excluded volume interactions In the q-range of 0002 to 001 -1 the rr-P3HT samples were analyzed to fit with power law model to extract the fractal dimension associated with network formation In our studies we have found that rapidly cooling rr-P3HT in ortho-dichlorobenzene solutions to -5 oC induces a novel gelation mechanism that proceeds through viscoelastic phase separation VPS between slow-moving rr-P3HT polymer chains and fast-moving solvent molecules1 Unlike conventional rr-P3HT gelation VPS-induced rr-P3HT gelation results in the formation of an interpenetrating P3HT network with micron-sized solvent-rich holes This observation suggests that VPS is a promising route to robustly form interconnected semi-crystalline polymer networks exhibiting high interfacial area with the small-molecule phase Pre-cooling solutions prior to doctor blading into thin films led to a doubling of the efficiency of rr-P3HTPCBM OSCs compared to devices comprising uncooled active layers Preliminary Results Upon VPS-induced gel formation we exposed rr-P3HTPCBM solutions to shear strains ranging from 01 to 100 Figure 1 displays the dependence of storage G and loss G moduli of the gels on the shear strain amplitude g characterized at a constant frequency of 1 rads and -5 C environment using a Couette geometry A linear viscoelastic region can be determined at which the G and G are independent of the strain amplitude applied ie g3 To examine the effect of solution shearing on the microstructure of P3HTPCBM films the solutions were removed from the rheometer and drop cast onto silicon wafers Upon solvent evaporation at room temperature the resultant films were examined using optical microscopy and two-dimensional wide-angle x-ray diffraction The insets in Fig 1 display typical optical micrographs of drop cast P3HTPCBM films deposited from solutions that were exposed to shearing in the linear regime left and non-linear regime right At low shear strains the deposited P3HTPCBM films appear featureless Surprisingly for films deposited from solutions exposed to 5 min of steady torsional shear at a shear rate of 2 s-1 square plate-like crystals on the order of 20 m and a nucleation density of approximately 1 x 105 nucleicm2 were achieved Two-dimensional x-ray diffraction patterns on these films confirmed that the plate-like crystals comprised PCBM These results indicate that solution shearing in the nonlinear regime can be used to induce crystallization of the small molecule component PCBM in P3HTPCBM films From our last trip to NCNR we have collected promising results on rr-P3HT solutions with and without PCBM in deuterated and non-deuterated o-DCB using rheo-SANS instrument in beamline NG7 Figure 2 shows typical SANS patterns of 25 Fig 2 SANS pattern of rr-P3HT in o-DCBd4 at room temperature and -5 C 0010111010010000002

volume fraction and dimensions of the P3HT crystals in agreement with reported values4 using Eq 1 We were not successful in observing PCBM aggregation during shearing due to time limitations and contrast matching problems of the system in hand Proposed Experiments To the best of our knowledge our discovery of shear-induced crystallization of a small-molecule component embedded within polymer gel solutions is unprecedented In addition the observation that the presence of the PCBM and Rra-P3HT in the system does not affect rr-P3HT crystallization is of scientific interest Based on our preliminary results from our run in September 2019 we propose the following set of experiments to elucidate the impact the presence of Rra-P3HT PCBM and small-molecule o-IDTBR have on rr-P3HT gel network formation As a potentially transformative method to form polymer nanocomposite systems incorporating functional crystals with tunable size and density we propose to use rheo-SANS to investigate the P3HT gel structure during steady and oscillatory shearing both in the linear and nonlinear regimes This knowledge will advance a fundamental understanding of how shearing induces small-molecule nucleation in these systems Specifically the experiments we want to carry out are listed as below 1 sample under two different shear conditions at 2 temperatures took 12 hours to
