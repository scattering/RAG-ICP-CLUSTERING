Neutron Scattering Structural Studies on Zeolite Imidazolate Frameworks Encapsulating Stabilized Metal Clusters Metal-organic frameworks MOFs reveal high specific surface areas tunable pore sizes and organic linkers which are able to interact with guest ions Challenging goals in these systems are the selective formation and stabilization of very small metal clustersparticles inside their cavities Recently a widespread attention has been paid to the chemically very robust subclass of MOFs called zeolite imidazolate frameworks ZIFs due to their large-scale industrial applications They are efficient sorbent materials that can be used for catalytic ion exchange gas storage and gas separation applications In particular the doping of ZIFs with metal clusters is of interest for heterogeneous catalysis and hydrogen storage Indeed the tailored functionalization of the coordination space of ZIFs offers unique perspectives that are beyond any other porous materials Recently In collaboration with Dr S Teixeira NCNRU Delaware preliminary SANS and USANS data on analogous systems was collected at the NCNR see Fig1 for two types of microporous alumino-silicate zeolites doped with Ag ions We have got approved beam time for elucidating a set of pure synthetic zeolites to investigate parameters paramount to kinetic and catalytic mechanism for such types of zeolites doped with Ag Au and Cu ions In comparison ZIFs as being metal organic frameworks made from zinc ions coordinated by four imidazolate rings in the same way as Si and Al atoms are covalently joined by bridging oxygens in zeolites Fig 1 right Figure Preliminary SANSUSANS date for a system of zeolites synthesized in our group left and middle and the chemical structure of ZIFs as a metal organic framework made by zinc ions coordinated by four imidazolate rings in the same way as Si and Al atoms are covalently joined by bridging oxygens in zeolites The sphere represents the pore size within the framework which can be used for entrapping the proposed metal clusters right Indeed this encouraged us to propose such type of nanoporous materials ZIFs for performing neutron scattering experiments in order to study the structural and morphological peculiarities of stabilized Au Ag Pd and Pt clusters inside the functionalized ZIFs cavities Neutron scattering profiles can provide information on the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples on fractal dimensions and mean pore diameters and provide the added advantage of contrast modulation to discriminate hydration-related propertieseffects We are also planning to incorporate specially designed deuterated ligands for clusters stabilization over a wide range of metal loading This would help us to investigate parameters paramount to kinetic and catalytic mechanism for metal-loaded ZIFs Besides the proposed neutron scattering experiments would help us to determine the atomicity of metal clusters after they are encapsulated in ZIFs cavities and the size effects of such ultra-small metal clusters Further it can complement our ongoing investigations and endeavors to elucidate hydrogen spillover effects in the adsorption process We shall investigate nano-sized ZIFs functionalized with stabilized Ag Au Pd and Pt clusters amounting to a total of 20 samples over a range of metal loading 5-30 wt for each type of clusters Given that we will measure them both in the hydrated and dry forms this amounts to 40 samples We are proposing to use a combination of SANS USANS and vSANS where the penetrating power of neutrons is important to provide representative averages of the loaded pore sizes and distributions to characterize the functionalized ZIFs From our previous measurements for zeolites systems we estimate an average of 50 mins of SANS beamtime per sample Taking into consideration background measurements empty cell blocked beam etc we require about 4 days of beamtime on one of the SANS instruments to cover a q-range of 0001-1 A-1 On the USANS regime we will measure a q range of up to 0003A-1 to cover potential turning point between pore size distributions prior to the transition to a resolution that can capture the surface properties We estimate this requires 5h of measuring time per sample amounting to about 10 days of beamtime on the BT5 USANS instrument It would be also informative if we manage to use vSANS that would cover extended q-range with its high-resolution detector 5 days in order to secure reliable high statistics data Relevant Literature 1 Cui X Li
