Proposed Experiment Characterization of multiple phases in URu2-xMxSi2 for M  Co and Ir Kalyan Sasmal1 and M Brian Maple1 1Department of Physics University of California San Diego La Jolla CA 92093 USA Scientific Importance The heavy-fermion superconductor URu2Si2 is crystallized in the ThCr2Si2-type structure with space group I4mmm and is well known for its hidden order HO phase Despite much effort however the origin of this transition at THO and the order parameter in the low-temperature phase have never been unveiled thus the term hidden order is adapted for the mysterious phase appearing at THO for more than three decades The phase transition into the HO state at THO175 K is characterized by a Large lambda-like BCS-type specific heat anomaly  anomalies in ultrasound  and thermal expansion  a substantial increase in thermal conductivity  a hump in electrical resistivity  a kink in magnetic susceptibility  the opening of a large gap in the incommensurate spin excitation spectrum  the crossing of the chemical potential by a heavy electron band  and a small seemingly extrinsic strain-induced magnetic moment 7 Neutron diffraction measurements only detect a very small ordered moment 003 B which is too small to give such large bulk signatures This has prompted theorists to propose various exotic mechanisms to explain this so-called hidden order Taken together these phenomena certainly suggest that partial gapping of the Fermi surface is involved in the transition into the HO state but in the absence of dipolar order it has been theoretically necessary to invoke exotic ordering of either local or itinerant electrons as the underlying cause Proposals include nesting-driven 91 and unconventional Kondo scenarios 111 Nevertheless the origin of the phase transition at THO in URu2Si2 is still puzzling and the nature of hidden-order phase has become an issue of great interest in heavy-fermion physics Generally chemical substitution of neighboring transition metals for Ru leads to destruction of the HO and stabilization of competing magnetic order Upon substitution of Re for Ru the HO phase gives way to ferromagnetism 1 Long-range order has been confirmed by neutron scattering at high Re concentration 141 In recent work on URu2-xMxSi2 with M  Co and Ir we found that substitution of Co and Ir suppresses the HO features by x  01 above which no magnetic or electronic ordering is observed up to x  02 XRD verifies that URu2xMxSi2 retains the same structure at all x For M  Ir the signature of an antiferromagnetic phase AFM1 begins to emerge at x  03 and develops into a measurable Nel temperature TN1  435 K for xIr06 For M  Co an antiferromagnetic phase AFM2 emerges for URu2xCoxSi2 at xCo  10 and varies with x for xCo 14 with TN2  113 K and returns to TN  825 K for the parent compound UCo2Si2 The evolution of magnetic scattering with temperature is very important for characterizing these new magnetic phases and their relationship with one another and the HO phase that forms at lower M substituent concentrations 1 These experiments will provide valuable insight into the formation of HO and these new magnetic phases in this strongly correlated electron system in which competing interactions can be tuned via chemical substitution and the application of an external pressure or high magnetic fields leading to new emergent phases Preliminary Work As mentioned before experimental studies on URu2-xMxSi2 for M  Co and Ir covered XRD measurement transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements So far there has not been any published result on neutron scattering of this system The following are the resistivity and magnetization figures for xIr06 and xCo14 compared with parent URu2Si2 Experiment Plan and Data Analysis We propose to perform high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer BT-1 to obtain neutron powder diffraction data for crystallographic analysis by the Rietveld method as well to determine the magnetic structures and characterize the low energy excitations in powdered poly crystals of URu2-xMxSi2 for M  Co and Ir on BT-1 at concentrations x  06 for Ir in the AFM1 region and x  14 for Co in the AFM2 region Because none of the measured excitations in URu2Si2 exceed 10 meV and a high energy resolution is desired near the elastic line BT-1 seems like an appropriate tool We proposed to apply magnetic field of 1 T and measurements will be performed at a few different low temperatures 15 K 25 K 50 K 75 K 100 K 125 K and 150 K We request 2-3 days of beam time Safety Considerations
