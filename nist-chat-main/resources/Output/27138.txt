Low-energy relaxation and excitations in a fluoride pyrochloreAllen ScheieDated Nov 14 2019INTRODUCTIONPyrochlore lattices with interacting spins support fascinating physics Alongside many other predicted states thegeometry of corner-sharing tetrahedra are expected to stabilize a spin liquid under perfectly isotropic interactions Experimental realizations of this state remain elusive rendering much theoretical work unverified We propose asingle crystal neutron experiment to investigate a promising new spin-liquid candidate NaSrMn2F7 This work willhelp to determine the nature of spin excitations from a semi-classical spin liquidNaSrMn2F7 is a member of a family of fluoride pyrochlore compounds discovered by Bob Cavas group at PrincetonUniversity  Two sister compounds NaCaCo2F7  and NaCaNi2F7  have recently been studied by neutronscattering The Co compound is an XY antiferromagnet which appears to be close to an order-by-disorder transitionThe Ni compound resembles the classical spin liquid phase predicted for a Heisenberg pyrochlore lattice but someperturbations arising from anisotropies are visible in the polarized neutron spectrum  NaSrMn2F7 is the thirdmember of this fluoride pyrochlore family to be studied by neutron scattering Two previous neutron experiments onMACS at NCNR and HySPEC at ORNL revealed a very isotropic disordered magnetic ground state see Figs 3and 4 with scattering features reminiscent of the Heisenberg pyrochlore spin liquid One unexpected feature of the data is shown in Fig 3a a diffuse ring of magnetic scattering around the 220Bragg peak This ring is reminiscent of weathervane modes seen for example in ZnCr2O4 where six spins arounda hexagon have a very low energy collective mode  Such collective modes form exotic quasiparticles in theories ofpyrochlore spin liquids  In that case this system will be extremely interesting to the theoretical community To testthese ideas and determine the relation of NaSrMn2F7 to the elusive spin liquid state of matter it will be necessaryto measure the timescale of spin fluctuations around this elastic ring of scattering This is an ideal experiment forNeutron Spin EchoDESCRIPTION OF COMPOUNDNaSrMn2F7 is a magnetic pyrochlore material with the Mn2 S  52 sites in a lattice of corner-sharing tetra-hedraOur sample is a very large high quality 15 g single crystal sample see Fig 1 We already have detailedmeasurements of the bulk properties of NaSrMn2F7 and the high-energy neutron spectrum Specific heat shows nosharp thermal anomaly down to 100 mK while a frequency dependent cusp in the temperature dependence of ACsusceptibility data indicates a spin-glass state with a glass freezing temperature of 26 K  High temperature sus-ceptibility data Fig 2 indicate a Weiss temperature of -90 K and an effective magnetic moment of 625 B  Thelarge crystal and substantial moment ensures a strong magnetic scattering signalFigure 1 NaSrMn2F7 15g single crystalWe have measured the magnetic neutron spectrum in two previ-ous experiments see Figs 3 and 4 which had energy resolutionsof 01 meV and 04 meV These experiments clearly resolved thehigher-energy magnetic excitations but they were unable to tellthe difference between low-energy excitations and elastic scatter-ing To more clearly measure this and complete the picture of themagnetic excitations in NaSrMn2F7 a higher resolution neutronscattering technique is necessaryPROPOSED EXPERIMENTWe propose a low temperature neutron scattering experiment onNSE on our high quality single crystalline sample of NaSrMn2F7oriented in the hk scattering plane An orange cryostat with a 3He insert will be sufficient to reach well belowfreezing temperatures The goal of this experiment will be to measure the timescale of magnetic fluctuations thatappear elastic in low-energy-resolution experiments This technique has proved quite successful with other magneticpyrochlore materials 2Figure 2 NaSrMn2F7 susceptibility and magnetization CWfits from 200-300 K yield CW  897K and  625 B0 2 020 meV0 2 4 0242 meV0 2 021 meV0 2 4 0243 meV040800071401530 00510 Figure 3 Constant energy slices of NaSrMn2F7 in hk at03 K2 0 2HH20200Pz SF2 K -
