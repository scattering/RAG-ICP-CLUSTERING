Scientific importance The first discovery of magnetic skyrmions was in the chiral helimagnet MnSi using small-angle neutron scattering SANS  Here a clear diffraction pattern from an ordered skyrmion lattice SkL was observed Skyrmions have since been observed in large range of both metallic and insulating magnetic materials and at a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields The interest in skyrmion systems is in large part due to their promise in future data storage applications as very low currents are required for their manipulation The conventional paradigm is that skyrmion formation require a substantial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction DMI However skyrmions have also been observed in systems without DMI 2- and recently there are theoretical predictions that skyrmions may form in materials that would ordinarily be considered unfavorable  It is therefore reasonable to expand the search for new skyrmions forming materials Preliminary work The magnetic phase diagram of Cerium Antimony CeSb shown in Fig 1left was established by neutron scattering more than 40 years ago  This material undergoes several metamagnetic transitions  Fig 1right Here we focus on the plateau S phase observed at base temperature in the range between roughly 2 and 37 T Recently careful magnetization studies revealed additional subtle features and an apparent transition at 26 T as shown in Fig 2 This existence of a transition is confirmed by specific heat and Hall effect measurements not shown and in multiple samples The small change in the magnetization makes it unlikely that this is associated with a transition between commensurate magnetic phases Rather it is more likely to be due to a long wavelength magnetic phase in the down layer of the up-up-down S phase Furthermore the sharpness of the 26T feature suggests that it is due to a correlated phase formation Experiment plan We propose to perform exploratory SANS measurements of CeSb to establish whether a long wavelength magnetic state and possibly a SkL exists within S magnetic phase Single crystals J ROS SAT-MIGNOD et al 16Ce Sb Incrshg field HII 001ttts qS2 5  demeln Kzs  FIG 3 Magnetic phasediagram of CeSb for an

collaboration with P Canfield at Ames LaboratoryIowa State University Typical masses are several tens of milligrams which together with the large 21B magnetic moment of the Ce3 ions  is expected to give a strong neutron scattering signal Furthermore samples have been thorough characterized by P Canfield and A Ramirez at the University of California Santa Cruz We estimate that 3 days of beam time on the NG-7 SANS instrument is required for an initial exploratory study Following the initial setup this will allow the measurement of roughly ten different fields in the range 2 to 37 T with the emphasis on the transition region around 26 T seen in Fig 2 The magnetic field will be applied along the fourfold 00 direction of the rock salt structure of CeSb We note that the experimental team have extensive SANS experience both applied to the skyrmion lattice as well as the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors  Safety considerations No safety precautions are required beyond the usual ones for experiments that involve cryogenic temperatures and moderate magnetic fields References 1 S Mhlbauer et al Science 323 915 2009 2 M Nagao et al Nature Nanotechnology 8 325328 2013 3 X Z Yu et
