Yoneda wing as a func-tion of magnetic eld for a continuousFe90Zr10V70Zr3 20We would like to use Polarized Neu-tron Re ectivity PNR and o -specularPolarized Neutron Scattering PNS tostudy dynamics induced by changes in ap-plied eld and thermally induced transi-tions in an amorphous multilayered struc-ture pattered into the shape of circulardiscs Amorphous materials are alone in-teresting considering it can be viewed asisotropic and exhibit good layer perfec-tion  This allows an exciting andaccessible route to tailor properties suchas magnetism within a layer but also be-tween adjacent layers With PNR andPNS we have con rmed that a continu-ous amorphous ferromagneticnon-magneticFe90Zr10V70Zr3 20 multilayer stack forma magnetic domain structure when sample isdemagnetized This was achieved by previously PNS measurements performed at ILL us-ing the re ectometer SuperADAM Fig 1 show obtained data for the integrated intensityover the Yoneda wing collected in the spin up-up and down-up channels as a function ofmagnetic eld As can be seen the intensity is decreasing a with eld strength indicatingexistence of magnetic domains that are disappearing when an external magnetic eld isappliedFigure 2 Sketch of circular islandsPatterning this multilayer stack into circulardiscs results in completely di erent magneticbehaviour 2 First of all the magnetic do-main formation is suppressed and a single-domain state becomes more favourable Secondly stray elds originating from theedges of the magnetic element modi es themagnetic arrangement in the stack and anantiferromagnetic order is introduced seeFig 2 The antiferromagnetic ordering re-sults in a di erent disordering process compared to its continuous counterpart A pre-melting of the structure will arise well below the ordering temperature of the islandmaterial Performing PNS when no external magnetic eld is applied we expect mag-netic di use scattering and a half-order magnetic Bragg peak Q12 to appear in theintensity QzQx-map due to the antiferromagnetic arrangement in the multilayer stackThis intensity is proportional to the magnetisation m2i  of the islands By increasing thetemperature one could then use the intensity originating from the Q12 to determine the1ordering parameter of the patterned multilayer stack which is a completely new way ofdetermining an ordering parameter of a systemBy applying an external magnetic eld in the sample plane saturating the sample andallowing a ferromagnetic ordering will result in a magnetic di use scattering at positionsof the Bragg re ections coming from the multilayer periodicity and at Bragg di ractionspots arising due to to the periodic pattern The intensity is at these positions are propor-tional to the magnetisation m2i  of the islands and we will therefore be able to determinea disordering process parameter of the system As the eld of the system is reducedtowards zero in intensity will be redistributed to the Q12-peak and we will be able todetermine the strength of the coupling between the layers within a multilayer stackBy performing full spin polarized analysis collecting all four spin states and the wholereciprocal space map we will be able to analyse how the direction of the magnetisationwithin each layers evolves We therefore consider that this experiment to be an excellentexample to show the power of PNR and PNS providing more detailed information thanother bulk methods especially for a complex system having two arti cial periodicitiesProposed ExperimentOur planned experiment will be concentrated on performing PNR and PNS as a functionof both temperature and applied external magnetic eld by using MAGIK We intendto start by measuring at room temperature were the sample is nonmagnetic and the nu-clearchemical scattering can be obtained This will be performed to have a referencepoint making it easier to interpret the di use scattering arising due to magnetism Nexttemperature will be at below ordering temperature 10 K At this temperature datawill be collected in zero external eld and at high eld strength in the state where mul-tilayer stack Fe90Zr10V70Zr3 is ferromagnetically aligned This measurements will beperformed to get the reference point where sample is fully magneticSince it is only the integrated intensity over the half-order magnetic Bragg peak Q12that is needed to determine the ordering parameters for the multilayer stack only afew hours scans at these positions as a function of temperature is neededTo determinethe e ect of an applied eld and obtain information about the strength of the couplingbetween the layers we only need to collect and integrate the magnetic di use scatteringarising at positions of the Bragg re ections coming from the multilayer periodicity Thismeans that only a few hour scan is needed The preparation for the experiment andtemperature changes will in total take about 1 day Each PNR and PNS measurementwill take approximately 17 hours to record We therefore require a minimum of 5 daysbeamtime in order to record the full data and to determine the ordering parametersSample description and preparationThe sample for proposed experiment consists of 20 alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers see Fig 2 Both the elemental and compositional selection was thought-fully considered having in mind the large SLD contrast between Fe90Zr10 and V70Zr30 andmagnetic behaviour of the Fe90Zr10-layer The thickness of the spacer layer is well above2the limit for any interlayer exchange coupling though the V70Zr30-layer and interactionsbetween the magentic layers can therefore be neglected  To eliminate crystallizationat the substratemultilayer interface and to protect the structure from oxidation a bu erand cap layer of Al70Zr30 has been deposited having thicknesses of 20 respectively 60 AThe second layer from the bottom is a Sm17Co83-layer deposited in an external magnetic eld applied parallel to the lm plane Sm17Co83 is a hard ferromagnet and depositing itin a magnetic eld results in an imprinted uniaxial anisotropy de ning an easy axis in theplane along the growth eld direction and a hard axis perpendicular to it Due to the softnature of Fe90Zr10 the direction of the magnetisation within each ferromagnetic layer isstrongly a ected by the imprinted anisotropy in the Sm17Co83-layer The magnetizationof the bottom Fe90Zr10-layer is pinned and therefore mediates the antiferromagnetic cou-pling between the layers On the contrary the top-most Fe90Zr10-layer is not pinned it islacking in number of neighbours and therefore experience a weaker dipole coupling Theextremity of the stack can thereby be aligned more easily to an applied eld Dependingon the eld protocol used during the experiment we therefore will obtain di erent pat-terns of the magnetic di use scattering which will tell us about the reversal mechanismwhitin the magnetic layersThe multilayer stack is deposited on a 20x20 mm2 substrates in order to have a bigscattering area It is pattered into arrays of circular islands having a diameter of 8 m with a separation of 1 m resulting in a periodicity of 9 m The size of theelements are fabricated considering obtaining both interesting magnetic e ects at thesame time as obtain su cient intensity in a reasonable time The sample will be fullycharacterized with gracing incident di raction in order to assure good amorphicity X-rayre ectivity experiments will be performed to determine the layer thickness prior to thebeamtime The magnetization will be determined as a function of temperature by usingthe longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr e ect setup along both the easy and hard axis andabsolute moments will be obtained by VSM H Raabaei et al
