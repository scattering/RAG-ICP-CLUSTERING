 Supported-polymer sorbents for CO2 capture polymer dynamics as a function of interaction type between polymer-support Scientific Importance Rising atmospheric levels of anthropogenic CO2 have generated interest in developing technologies for carbon capture storage and utilization  Silica-supported amines represent a promising class of carbon capture materials balancing high CO2 capacity with rapid and energy-efficient adsorptiondesorption cycling Theses sorbents can pave pathways to negative emission technologies given that they can capture CO2 not only from flue gas 10 CO2 but also directly from the air DAC 400 ppm CO2 2 Amino-polymers particularly polyethyleneimine PEI are used extensively in these solid composite adsorbents A schematic of a carbon capture process using supported PEI in the pore space of mesoporous silica SBA-15 is shown in Figure 1 along with the associated adsorption chemistry The total CO2 capacity thermodynamic property and CO2 uptake rate transport and kinetic property of the adsorbents both play a critical role in their overall performance Optimization of the carbon capture process will ultimately require a firm understanding of the relationship between the dynamics of the confined polymer and the mass transfer of CO2 through the polymer network Figure 1 a Schematic process for CO2 adsorption and recovery The hexagonally-packed

base species and may be another amine or water d STEM micrograph of a typical SBA-15 particle synthesized in our lab We have previously used SANS to investigate the morphology of PEISBA-15 hybrids  and show that PEI fills the mesopores starting with the formation of a thin conformal layer along the pore walls at low loadings1 while subsequent simultaneous axial and radial deposition of PEI leads to plug formation with a further increase in PEI loadings Fig 2a The sorbents with higher loadings of PEI in SBA-15 show both an increase in amine efficiency during CO2 capture ratio of adsorbed CO2N species and higher chain mobility as measured by QENS Fig 2b  The nature of the support-to-polymer interactions also has been studied The attractive interaction between the silanol groups that terminate the surface of SBA-15 and the amine groups in PEI can be changed to repulsive interactions by capping the silanols with hydrophobic groups hexamethyldisilazane HMDS This resulted in increased mobility of the incorporated polymer as evident in the QENS spectra via broadening Fig 2b marked with HMDS  We hypothesize that different types of support-to-polymer interactions may affect polymer dynamics which in turn affects CO2 uptake and understanding the nature of confined polymers within different types of supports could provide a handle for further optimization of supported polymers as CO2 capture sorbents In this study we will use QENS to examine how different interaction types between PEI and pore walls of the support 1 the strength of hydrogen bonding 2 van der Waals interactions and 3 covalent tethering of polymers to the pore surface affect the chain mobility of PEI in PEISBA-15 composites We will compare the results with molecular dynamics MD simulations and characterize the stability of the confined polymers after several regeneration steps to determine which interaction mode most benefits CO2 capture We expect the results will facilitate both understanding and optimizing this family of supported-amine sorbents Preliminary Work We have determined by QENS that silica-supported PEI has a reduced mobility relative to bulk PEI due to interactions between the polymer and silanol groups along pore walls These interactions can be altered by capping silanols with hydrophobic HMDS which yields increased mobility of the supported polymer and increased capture capacities  We have also previously demonstrated the link between molecular dynamics simulations and QENS experimental data in PEISBA-15 systems 4 For this study we propose that the mobility of PEI will be affected by the nature of the functional 1 HDMS-capped surfaces follow a similar pore-filling pathway as bare unfunctionalized surfaces groups that line the pores of SBA-15 and that by tuning the PEI-wall interactions the mobility of the PEI and therefore the uptake of CO2 can be tuned Figure 2 a Schematic of PEI-filling motifs in SBA-15 PEI first forms a thin conformal coating on the pore walls top but with increasing fill fraction the polymer aggregates into plugs that grow axially  b QENS of bulk black and supported PEI 20 blue and 40 green in SBA-15 and 40 in SBA-15 with surface silanols capped with HMDS red samples at 375K and Q087 -1  Choice of Instrument We request to use the High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer HFBS Our previous experience on this instrument shows that the energy range is able to probe the full range of motions that we expect for these types of PEIsilica materials Experiment Plan We propose to investigate the dynamics of polymers confined in SBA-15 having four different types of surface chemistries silanol amine aliphatic halide and aliphatic hydrocarbon using QENS SBA-15 with these types of modified surface chemistries will be synthesized in our laboratory at Georgia Tech We will compare the polymer dynamics of PEI within SBA-15 materials with these four types of surface chemistries Sorbents with 40 wt PEI will be prepared since in this loading condition in which we were able to distinguish the differences in dynamics of PEI  We expect that silanols and amines on the pore surface will interact with the polymer via hydrogen bonding H bonds with different strengths Silanols having lower pKa than amines would show stronger H bonds with amine groups  and therefore the polymers would exhibit slower dynamics than that confined in the amine-terminated SBA-15 Polymers covalently tethered by reactions between alkyl halide groups Br or Cl on the pore walls and amine groups of PEI may exhibit slower dynamics but they are expected to be more stable during regeneration steps On the other hand polymers contained by only van der Waals interactions with alkyl groups lining the pore walls will exhibit faster dynamics but with larger probability of leaching The samples will be rigorously prepared in an inert environment to avoid contamination Fixed window scans will be taken and QENS spectra will be collected at 325 350 375 and 400 K for each sample to generate an Arrhenius model To complete the described work we request 7 days on the NG2 HFBS In total we will have 5 samples containing one control sample four types of surface-functionalized SBA-15 with 40 wt PEI Silica materials under inert gas serve as our control sample pure polymer control done in a previous beam allocation Each sample will be measured at 3 temperatures ranging from 325K to 400K Allowing for 35 hours per sample to run a fixed-window scan and QENS at three temperatures we expect to complete all runs in 7 days We will also require aluminum foil-seal sample cans with gas purging capability which will be discussed with NIST staff prior to experimentation Data Analysis and Scientific Outcomes We plan to interpret the data quantitatively using methods previously applied by our group  We will extract EISF and FWHM parameters by fitting the quasi-elastic components to common diffusion models and determine the extent to which the polymer motion can be described by either free center of mass diffusion or tethered diffusion varied due to different interaction types with pore walls Based on previous work we anticipate these multiple modes of motion will require individual fitting Safety Considerations These materials are either non-hazardous powders We will require a temperature range of 325 to 400 K for our sample environment however the QENS cans and indium seals are known to be stable in this range of temperatures and are appropriate for the pressure generated from heating
