LIQUID WATER DISTRIBUTION in ELECTROCHEMICAL HYDROGEN SEPARATORSCOMPRESSORS Ugur Pasaogullari University of Connecticut EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beam time is requested to determine the distribution of liquid water in the electrochemical hydrogen separatorcompressor cells EHSC EHSC cells are similar to polymer electrolyte fuel cells PEFC in materials and cell assembly however they are used to purify and compress hydrogen by utilizing hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions in the anode and the cathode respectively Unlike a fuel cells there is no water production however migration due to water content and pressure gradients as well as electro-osmotic drag results in highly non-uniform water distribution in EHSC cells affecting the performance and operation We propose to conduct experiments to visualize liquid water formation in the anode water content distribution across thick polymer electrolyte membranes and liquid water accumulation in the gas channels BACKGROUND EHSC Operating Principles EHSC cells are constructed similarly to polymer electrolyte fuel cells with similar materials Figure 1 shows a schematic of the operating principle of an EHSC cell where hydrogen oxidation takes place in the anode and recombination of protons with electrons take place in the cathode through hydrogen evolution reaction Since the polymer electrolyte is highly selective towards protons only hydrogen and water exists in the cathode effectively purifying the hydrogen electrochemical hydrogen separation A pressure differential can also be maintained between the cathode and the anode electrochemical hydrogen compression Both hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions are rather facile with very low overpotentials hence the EHSC operation is mostly governed by ionic conduction and Nernst potential Role of Water Distribution Ionic conduction in polymer electrolytes typically used in EHSC cells eg Nafion is a strong function of water content Especially in EHCs thick polymer electrolytes are used to maintain the pressure differential therefore a large portion of the EHSC cell polarization originates from the ohmic resistance in the polymer electrolyte hence the water distribution becomes critically important In addition the hydrogen produced in the cathode is the product gas and to decrease final processing of the product gas eg drying there is a desire to minimize amount of water vapor in the product hydrogen This requires the cathode side of the polymer electrolyte membrane to have a lower water content and complicates the water management especially in balancing the electro-osmotic drag from the anode with back-diffusion and permeation All the water required for hydration of the polymer electrolyte supplied through the anode however at lower flow rates water vapor in the anode reaches saturation rapidly and cell flooding occurs Recently Lee and Huang developed a new wetproofing approach for EHSC porous diffusion media Lee  Huang 2019 Traditional PTFE based wetproofing used in carbon-based diffusion media for fuel cells cannot be used in metal based porous media eg sintered titanium in EHSCs due to Figure 1 Schematic of EHSC operation Figure 2 Effective contact angle of the O-CNT coating on porous media Lee and Huang 2019 lower porosities and high temperature processing required with PTFE The oxidized carbon nanotube O-CNT based wetproofing showed highly improved recovery from flooded anode conditions compared to uncoated diffusion media NEUTRON RADIOGRAPHY EXPERIMENTS Primary objective of the neutron radiography experiments is to verify the effect of O-CNT coating on the cell flooding and recovery in EHSC cells We plan on adapting our previously developed high resolution cell hardware for these experiments Test Articles EHC hardware varies significantly from a typical fuel cell test hardware due to high differential pressure therefore we will limit our experiments to EHS cells with no applied pressure differential Diffusion media and other soft goods polymer electrolyte diffusion media gaskets and seals will be selected similar to full-sized EHSC stacks assembled by Skyre Inc but will be custom sized to fit our previously developed NIST cell hardware shown in Figure 3 Thick membranes eg 0007 thick Nafion117 will be used both emulate the components of the EHSC assembly as well as to increase the number of usable data points across the polymer electrolyte We will use our previously developed algorithm Fu Pasaogullari Shiomi Hussey  Jacobson 2012 to account for polymer electrolyte swelling in determining the water thickness Figure 3 shows a picture of the cell hardware We will fabricate multiple new hardware using the same design We will assemble and test the cells prior to shipping to NIST We anticipate minimal cell disassembly and assembly at NIST during our beamtime Cell Flooding and Recovery Experiments We will perform neutron radiography during the cell flooding following the start-up of the EHS cells The EHS cells will flood more rapidly at higher recovery rates eg low stoichiometry and lower temperatures hence these two parameters will be controlled to observe the rate and amount of liquid water accumulation in the anode of an EHS We will perform these experiments in our lab prior to arrival to fine-tune our experimental matrix These experiments should provide us with sufficient information to design on experimental matrix conditions test times ramp rates and will provide information to verify cell condition prior to the start of neutron radiography experiments We expect these experiments two take 8-12 hours for each experimental condition temperature and flow rate including setup and test times We will have at least two different porous diffusion media one untreated and one treated with O-CNT coatings for wetproofing We will use available high-resolution detectors for these experiments after discussions with the beamline team Liquid Water Accumulation in Gas Channels and Manifolds Depending on the experimental design of the cell flooding and recovery experiments and assigned beam time we also plan on conducting a preliminary testing of full-scale EHS cells to understand the liquid water accumulation in the gas channels and the manifolds Figure 4 shows an example test hardware The exact hardware will be selected after discussions with the beamline team We plan on using Figure 4 Full-scale EHSC hardware by Skyre Inc Figure 3 UConn cell hardware developed for high-resolution neutron radiography the lower resolution large FOV detectors available for these experiments We anticipate spending no more than one-day of beam time on this experiment RESULTS from PRIOR NIF USE Our group was a frequent user of NIST Neutron
