Title VSANS for pH-responsive drug release Scientific Background On-site targeted microbial treatment represents new strategies to prevent infection and circumvent drug accumulation in the environment Stimuli-responsive materials generate AM activity locally on-demand thus avoid systemic antibiotics and overdose potentially reduce AM resistance However in all pioneering works an external trigger either light or chemicals was required and only nonspecific broad-spectrum AM activities were delivered We propose to use VSANS to evaluate pH-sensitive materials that detect and response to metabolic activities of acid-producing bacteria by adjusting the kinetics of drug release and consequently enhancing antimicrobial efficacy responding to the acid production of cariogenic bacteriabiofilms Impact Successful completion of the proposed project will provide new approaches to make stimuli-responsive materials for drug delivery and generate materialstools for understanding the ecological role of acid-producing bacteria within a multispecies community eventually advance preventiontreatment of polymicrobial diseases such as dental caries and industrial bio-corrosion Experimental details Materials Lab-synthesized mesoporous silica nanoparticles MSN sphere NPs 150 nm in diameter 3 nm pore size surface functionalized MSN with pH-responsive materials pH-MSN see figure below and pH-MSN loaded with chlorohexidine pH-MSN-CHX pH-MSN-CHX have a pH-responsive release D2O DCl and NaOD to obtain aqueous solution with different pHs pH  4 6 and 8 4-mm cells for loading the MSNs Samples to be evaluated empty cell D2O MSN in D2O pH-MSN in D2O pH-MSN-CHX in D2O and pH-MSN-CHX in different pH solutions Temperature 37 degree C Desired Q-ranges 05 -1 to 210-3 -1 Anticipated run times one measurement per sample total ten samples temporal pH-responsive release of pH-MSN-CHX one measurement per pH every hour for 14 h Total time request 24 h Expected outcomes 1 Size and structural changes induced by surface functionalization and drug loading by comparing results of MSN pH-MSN and pH-MSN-CHX and 2 Kinetic of CHX release from pH-MSN-CHX at different pHs and 3 Temporal structural changes of pH-MSN-CHX at different pH  Y Yang V Reipa G Liu Y Meng XH Wang KP Mineart VM Prabhu WY Shi NJ Ling XS He JR Sun pH-Sensitive Compounds for Selective Inhibition of Acid-Producing Bacteria ACS Appl Mater Interfaces 1010 2018 8566-8573
