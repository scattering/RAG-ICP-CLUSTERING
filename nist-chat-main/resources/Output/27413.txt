Leonid P Rokhinson Purdue University Valeria Lauter Oak Ridge National Laboratory Brian Kirby NIST Introduction Topological phase offers new possibilities for spintronics and lays the foundation for applications to information technology Inducing magnetic orders at the surface of a topological crystalline insulator TCI to break time reversal symmetry enables new quantum phenomena It has been recently demonstrated that coupling to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators can lead to the formation of a magnetic order at the TCImagnetic material interface Here we propose to study the magnetic proximity between a magnetic insulator MI EuSe and a TCI Meta-magnetic material EuSe has a rich phase diagram which includes antiferro- ferri- ferro- and paramagnetic phases We propose to investigate how interfacial exchange coupling depends on the bulk magnetization of the magnetic material For instance if the large exchange coupling in the interfacial Eu layer is mediated by the Dirac states via the RKKY-type mechanism the Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy at the interface can be modified compare to the bulk of EuSe In addition we will study various types of magnetic order in superlattices to realize new emergent quasiparticles in predicted in superlattices In this connection PNR applied to a single interface and to a superlattice is a unique method that provides information valuable to lay a foundation for the design of future spintronic and topological quantum devices Scientific importance Topological crystalline insulator - materials with strong spin-orbit interaction which results in the bulk band inversion - are characterized by special symmetry protected surface states where spin is locked to electron momentum 1 These helical states are both a blessing and a curse of TITCI-based devices since on one hand they are protected by time-reversal symmetry on the other hand geometry of protected states cannot be constrained by simple lithographical techniques There are many applications of TIsTCIs that are being investigated though selective gapping of surface states will be beneficial for spintronic devices with disconnected top and bottom surfaces and the localization of non-Abelian states in TITCI-based topological superconductors  Several approaches to gap surface states have been investigated most successfully by doping TIsTCIs with magnetic impurities or overgrowing TIsTCIs with a ferromagnetic insulator 4 The former approach is a bulk doping which uniformly gaps both top and bottom surfaces leaving helical states at the edges of the TIsTCIs while the latter approach allows patterning of gapped regions Ferromagnetic films though introduce stray magnetic fields which are undesirable eg when TITCI is coupled to a low-Bc superconductor such as aluminum to form a topologically non-trivial superconductor A possible solution is to gap TITCI surface states via exchange coupling to an insulating antiferromagnetic material with zero net polarization In the past strong exchange interaction between EuS and Bi2Se3 has been reported with magnetization observed at temperatures 20 times larger than the Curie temperature of the bulk EuS  A number of follow-up theoretical works attribute this magnetization to the exchange interaction between Eu and Bi at the interface Very recently it was shown that TI surface states can be also gaped through an Fig 1 Magnetic phase diagram in bulk EuSe includes the following phases AF-II  AF-I  Ferri  and Ferro  2 interfacial coupling to an antiferromagnetic material Cr2O3  Here we plan to examine an exchange interaction between TCI PbSnSe and EuSe where EuSe is a meta-magnetic material with a rich phase diagram of magnetic phases spanning several anti- ferri- ferro- and paramagnetic phases see Fig 1  and study whether and how interfacial coupling depends on the magnetic phase in the bulk In particular three magnetic states the antiferromagnet AFM the ferrimagnet FiM and the ferromagnet FM found in EuSe in proximity with a TCI see Fig 2 AFM insulator EuSe In EuX X  O S Se and Te exchange interactions have a strong dependence on the lattice constant with EuO and EuS being ferromagnetic  K and EuSe and EuTe antiferromagnetic  K 9 1 EuSe is of particular interest owing to its almost perfect cancellation of exchange constants between nearest and next-nearest neighbors interactions which lead to a rich phase diagram of magnetic states Fig 1 Concentration of Eu atoms at a EuSePbSnSe interface can be reduced by partial substitution of Eu with Pb Both PbxEu1-xSe films or PbSeEuSe supperlattices can be epitaxially grown on BaF2 crystals with their lattice mismatch less than 1 Magnetization data for a EuSe film epitaxially grown on 111 BaF2 is shown in Fig 3 and XRD data for several PbSnSePdEuSe superlattices grown on 111 BaF2 is shown on Fig 4 Preliminary results Magnetic susceptibility measurements Fig 3 on epitaxial EuSe confirm formation of an antiferromagnetic state at low K and Oe and ferrimagnetic state at higher fields consistent with the phase diagram for a bulk crystal Fig 1 TCI PbySn1-ySe for y  023 a class of topological insulators in which crystalline symmetry replaces the role of time-reversal symmetry in ensuring topological protection 1 have been successfully grown on either epi-ready GaAs 111B or BaF2111 substrates by MBE technique Furthermore both PbxEu1-xSe films or PbSeEuSe supperlattices can also be epitaxially grown on BaF2 crystals with their lattice mismatch less than 1 We then performed thorough characterization of structural magnetic and transport properties of PbxEu1-xSePbySn1-ySe heterostructures Investigation of PbxEu1-xSePbySn1-ySe heterostructures will allow us to study Eu-Se exchange in a dilute limit and separate effects related to the magnetization in the EuSe film from direct Eu-Se exchange at a EuSePbSnSe interface In the next phase of this task GaAs111PbEuSeEuSePbSnSeEuSe structure will be used in the PNR measurement In addition we have successfully grown high quality Pb1-xSnxSePb1-yEuySe superlattice with y range from 0 to 1 as shown in Fig 4 We will first achieve epitaxial growth of EuSe-Pb1-xSnxSe-EuSe multilayer by molecular beam epitaxy and demonstrate induced magnetism at the interface by measuring the anomalous Hall response and a hysteretic in-plane magnetoresistance PNR measurement will confirm our expectation on the magnetization depth profile in this trilayer structure In this task multiquantum wells superlattice of

probe the magnetization of profile at the EuSe-Pb1-xSnxSe interface which is key to realize nodal line semimetal or a Weyl state Reasons to undertake PNR study PNR is the most sensitive tool which provides the microscopic information on the magnetic properties of thin film heterostructures with the spatial resolution to investigate interfacial magnetization We think PNR can give clear evidence to elucidate the effect of magnetic proximity effect on the interface of EuSe with TCI materials Samples Samples are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on either an epi-ready GaAs 111B or BaF2111 The
