Study the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in the Co-based honeycomb material An exactly solvable Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice has attracted considerable attention as it harbors both quantum and topological spin liquids and emergent Majorana quasiparticles  Unlike spin liquids found in geometrically frustrated quantum magnets the Kitaev spin liquid arises from the strong anisotropy and bond-dependent interactions that frustrate spin configuration on a single site  and such interactions dominate in materials with strong spin-orbital coupling SOC So far most of the theoretical and experimental investigations have been devoted to 4d and 5d transition-metal-based materials which have strong SOC effect including -RuCl3 A2IrO3 ALi Na and H3LiIrP6  Even though the ground state of these materials is not a Kitaev quantum spin liquid QSL but a magnetic order state instead Calculation based on Kitaev-Heisenberg model indicates that these ordered states can be pushed into the exotic Kitaev QSL state by applying some tuning parameters such as magnetic field  Inelastic neutron scattering results have shown that the ground state of -RuCl3 may be the Kitaev QSL phase  Recent theoretical studies have predicted that the Kitaev model can be predicted that the Kitaev model can be realized in a 3d7 electron configuration such as Co2 L1 S32  In the octahedral crystal field the Co2 ions have pseudospin-12 doublet in their ground state predominantly The hopping processes between orbitals t2g-eg t2g-t2g give rise to Kitaev-type bond-dependent anisotropic interactions These theoretical works have stimulated the search for Kitaev magnetism in Co-based materials like BaCo2P2O8 Na3Co2SbO6 and Na2Co2TeO6  Recently a Co-based honeycomb material BaCo2As2O8 attracted our attention for its interesting behaviors under an in-plane magnetic field based on our preliminary work This Co-based material consists of magnetic honeycomb layers with AsO3- units sit below and above the magnetic layer in the center of the Co-based honeycombs Fig 1a Large size single crystals obtained from flux method are shown in Fig 1b Orientation-dependent magnetization reveals the strong anisotropic behaviors under in-plane or out-of-plane field as shown in Fig 1c A more careful field-dependent magnetization was studied by ac susceptibility Fig 1d which shows two magnetic-field driven phase transitions at a relatively low field range By applying the in-plane field the magnetic ordering transition disappear above 05 T as found both in magnetization and heat capacity measurements Fig 1ef Similar behaviors have been reported for -RuCl3  which are now believed to have a Kitaev QSL state under the applied in-plane field In previous MACS experiments we found long-range incommensurate magnetic order peaks near Y point 100 in this sample down to 01 K as shown in Fig 2 a And the low energy spin waves disperse along hexagonal directions from the Y point as shown in Fig 2 b Both these magnetic orders and spin waves disappear above TN However there still low energy magnetic excitations with special pattern remain above TN as shown in Fig2 C which may relate to the spinon continuum from the QSL state We also tried applying magnetic field on this sample As the Kitaev model the long range magnetic order disappeared and the low E magnetic excitations almost not affected We propose to carry out inelastic neutron scattering measurements to probe the magnetic order and excitations in BaCo2As2O8 in a large Q and E range The measurements will focus on magnetic Bragg peaks at larger Q and magnetic excitations with energy higher than the previous MACS measurements and if possible to map out the entire band of the magnetic excitation We will also measure the temperature dependence of magnetic order and excitations in this sample The results will not only give us necessary information to understand the spin structuredynamics but also will give us more information of the special low E magnetic excitations from the QSL state The thermal neutron spectrometer BT7 is the most suitable instrument to perform these measurements because we need high intensity in a limited range of reciprocal space We have prepared high-quality BaCo2As2O8 single crystals for these measurements For the proposed neutron experiment we have co-align 1 g single crystals with HK0 plane and works good on MACS We would run our experiments in the HK0 plane with 00 vertical and measurements will cover the magnetic Bragg peaks and magnetic excitations in one quadrant Our current estimate would be that for base temperature it would take about 4 days to map out the magnetic Bragg peaks and excitations And we would like to measure at least 2 temperatures 3K 1520K To be able to finish the measure we will be asking for 7 days beam time on BT7 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100102030Temperature KC p JmolK05 T03 T01 T0 T02 T04 T07 T1 TH  c02468cac emumolCoOe0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000-002-001000001002Magnetic
