Using USANS to Study the Scaling Effect of Effective Porosity for Various Natural Rocks 1 Scientific Context - Fluid flow and mass transport in porous natural rock are critical processes in energy and environmental stewardship These processes are known to be affected by the porosity and pore size distribution of rocks namely the geometrical aspects of pore structure However our recent work has shown that pore connectivity a largely overlooked topological characteristic of pore structure is oftentimes more important than the geometrical aspects Hu et al 2012 2015 2017 The connectivity of pores in natural rock strongly affects fluid flow and mass transport to exhibit anomalous behavior and therefore significantly affects how those media may be used or explored For example solute diffusion in low-connectivity pore spaces cannot be described by classical Fickian behavior time exponent of 05 ie a square-root-of-time relationship between diffusive flux and time instead anomalous behavior time exponent of 026 is observed at some scales to be described by percolation theory Hunt and Ewing 2009 and classical at others This widely-ignored issue of pore connectivity has important consequences for long-term performance of geological repository to store high-level radionuclide wastes Hu et al 2012 remediation of contaminated sites Peng et al 2012 as well as hydrocarbon recovery in shale formations Hu et al 2015 2 Previous Work Performed - Given the importance of nano- and micro-scale pore structure on anomalous macro-scale fluid flow and mass transport in various geological media we have developed complementary approaches to pore characterization for a range of natural rocks including Berea sandstone Indiana sandstone dolomite welded tuff granite several leading American shale and standard clay minerals Using different sample sizes to quantify the representative elemental volume REV associated with the edge-accessible porosity the experimental approaches include porosimetry mercury intrusion porosimetry gas physisorption water vapor adsorptiondesorption isotherms imaging Woods metal impregnation SEM FIB-SEM CT development of different nano-sized tracers being applied in imbibition and diffusion tests with the subsequent micro-scale tracer mapping using laser ablation-ICP-MS The theoretical approaches of percolation theory and pore network modeling are also used to interpret the experimental results with the anomalous behavior and presenceabsence of REV Our preliminary results indicate a disparate characteristics and range of effective porosity with a single-zone behavior and a ratio value of effectivetotal porosity at approximately 70 for sandstones as compared to dual-connectivity zones with a transitional zone limited only to 400 m deep from the sample surface at ratio values of 70 and 001 for shale Hu et al 2015 Figure 1 In other words for tight rocks such as shale there might not exist the concept of REV as the edge-accessible effective porosity vanishes quickly with an increasing sample size because of an increasing proportion of isolated pores For tight rocks with a large presence of pore throats at sub-nm range the isolated pores can be attributed to the inherent inaccessibility from the common push-and-response approach involving a fluid whether helium nitrogen mercury water brine Woods metal and other probing fluids limited detection limit eg 50 nm spatial resolution for 50 m-sized sample with nano-CT or 5 nm for 10-m-sided cube with FIB-SEM or needs of prolonged testing duration due to extremely tortuous pathways constricted by nano-sized pore throats In other words as the sample size increases the effective porosity will be small due to the increasing portion of isolated pores However our current tools for the studies of pore structure in natural rocks cannot provide direct information of inaccessible pores Small-angle neutron scattering imaging SANS is the ONLY technique to non-destructively quantify total both connected and isolated with a wide spectrum 2of pore size at 1-500 nm for SANS and 200-20 m for USANS Recent developments in USANS techniques allow for the characterization of pore structure and solid-fluid interactions for geological materials eg Melnichenko et al 2012 Anovitz and Cole 2015 Bahadur et al 2018 and offers a unique approach to tackling the lingering REV issues for transformative discovery USANS offers a unique solution to quantifying the effective porosity of a range of natural rocks with a context of REV concept this is the goal of this user proposal A similar proposal was submitted to ORNL in March of 2019 with USANS approved for 5 days as compared to 8 requested days and SANS placed in Alternate Status without the allocated beamtime The shortage of beamtime to work with a range of rocks with disparate properties and more importantly the lack of access to SANS to probe pore spaces at 100 nm prevents us from achieving our research objectives at ORNL with this user proposal we are seeking the beam time for both SANS and USANS at NIST In brief summary this timely NIST proposal will achieve the following objectives 1 to focus on the basic science of deriving REV of several different natural rocks 2 to support a recently DOE-Nuclear Energy University Program NEUP project Reduced diffusion and enhanced retention of multiple radionuclides from pore structure characterization of barrier materials for enhanced repository performance with Dr Hu as the PI and 3 continue and expand our USANS work over the recent years to further maintain the momentum of our excellent productivity at both NIST and ORNL SCI publications from user proposals of recent years are shown in green in References section 3 Details of Proposed Experimental Approach To achieve our research objectives we request a total of 3 days of SANS 40-60 min per sample and 8 days of USANS 4-5 hr per sample for one trip A range of natural rock samples with a disparate range of porosity and permeability and associated pore connectivity to be tested are presented in Table 1 various shale samples are from Marcellus from Pennsylvania Mancos from New Mexico and Green River shale from Wyoming In addition standard clay minerals montmorillonite illite chlorite illite-smectite mixed layer and kaolin from the Source Clays Repository at Purdue University are included with a heavy focus on low-permeable materials shales and clays to support DOE-NEUP project Already available in PIs lab from his decades-long research these samples have been systematically characterized with a range of methods other than USANS Samples are to be prepared at three different grain sizes of 75-177 177-500 500-851 m by subjecting the rock fragments of 10 mm to a rock crusher for only a few seconds for disaggregation with a minimal disturbance to its pore structure These different sizes for each sample will help us to pinpoint the trend of edge-accessible porosity and associated REV parameters Table 1 A range of natural rocks from environmental and energy studies for USANS work Samples Source Porosity  Permeability m2White chalk Negev Desert Israel 454 43  10-16
