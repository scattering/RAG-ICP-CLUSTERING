Spin dynamics in spin liquid candidate NaErS2 Introduction Frustrated quantum magnets are at the forefront of research in condensed-matter physics because the lattice geometry suppresses the onset of conventional magnetic order and generates unconventional spin-liquid states  Antiferromagnetically coupled S12 spins on an isotropic triangular lattice are the paradigm of frustrated quantum magnetism but structurally ideal realizations are rare Numerous transition-metal compounds eg Cs2CuCl4  or a-CaCr2O4  approximate this Heisenberg model but depart from a perfect triangular lattice due to their lower spatial symmetries A structurally perfect example is Ba3CoSb2O9  although even in that case easy-plane anisotropy and interlayer coupling substantially modify the observed spin dynamics  with respect to the ideal case Recent studies have shown that the spin-orbit entangled Jeff12 moments of rare earth ions may exhibit a variety of nearly degenerate states An example is YbMgGaO4 for which recent thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurement indicates a possible quantum spin-liquid ground states  however chemical disorder due to the MgGa mixing on the same crystallographic site has clouded interpretations In the search for the ideal spin-12 triangular lattice with a spin-orbit interaction a large series rare earth compounds with general formula ALnX2 A  alkali metal Ln  rare earth ion X  Chalcogen ions has recently came into peoples sight  The family compounds share the same structure 5E-35Z as YbMgGaO4 and antiferromagnetically coupled rare-earth ions form perfect triangular layers that are well separated along the 5P-axis Much of the attention has been paid to the Yb-branches especially NaYbO2  and NaYbS2  both of which show intriguing spin liquid-like behavior the understanding of which is on-going In this proposal we focus on another compound of the ALnX2 family based on Er3 NaErS2 and our preliminary measurements indicate a disordered magnetic ground state which is worth further studies especially has it contrasts with other samples of same family such as NaErSe2 and KErSe2 that appear to order magnetically see eg IPTS-24170 Fig 1 a Crystal structure of NaErS2 b Single crystals NaErS2 grown by the flux method at Georgia Tech  c Specific heat and associated magnetic entropy for single crystal NaErS2 note that the phonon contribution has not been subtracted  d AC susceptibility measurement on single crystal NaErS2 with ac field parallel to c-axis Preliminary Work Previous measurements on polycrystalline sample NaErS2 indicate a weakly interacted Er3 moments at low temperature with a Curie-Weiss temperature of -46 K  Recently we have successfully synthesized single crystals of NaErS2 by flux method at Georgia Tech The crystals are in the form of thin flakes with c-axis perpendicular to the plate and with a typical dimension of 2201 mm3 Fig1 b We have performed thermodynamic measurements on the single crystals No sharp transitions are observed either in the low temperature specific heat or ac-susceptibility measurement down to 80 mK excluding a conventional magnetic ordering Instead both measurements show a broad peak within the temperature region between 03 - 1 K where the integrated magnetic entropy from 80 mK to 4 K reaches Rln2 Fig1 cd This imply a well-separated doublet crystal field ground state scenario for isolated Er3 whereas the many-body low temperature state is strongly correlated Furthermore we have performed crystal field excitation measurements on polycrystalline sample NaErS2 down to 15 K at SEQUOIA As shown in Fig 2a the measurements with Ei  8 meV clearly shows that the lowest energy crystal field excitation lies at 2 meV 23 K Consequently at temperatures well below 23 K the system can be well described by spin-12 triangular lattice antiferromagnet At 15 K the energy integrated data within -1  meV already shows structured magnetic diffuse scattering Fig 2b indicating the system is indeed frustrated Importantly this diffuse scattering is not purely elastic but consists of a large spectral weight in the inelastic chancel below 06 meV Fig 2c This observation suggests that the system cannot be described by a classical spin liquid such as spin ice compound MgEr2S4 where the spin-spin correlations are purely static elastic Together with the rich physics related to its Yb analog we conclude that the system possibly hosts a quantum disordered ground state that deserve further investigations of its spin correlations and dynamics Fig 2 a Crystal field excitation measurements on polycrystalline sample NaErS2 at 15 K and Ei8 meV at SEQUOIA b The Q-dependence of the magnetic diffuse scattering within -1  meV at T  15 K c The low energy spin dynamics at T  15 K For both b and c a high-temperature background has been subtracted Choice of Instrument Due to the low energy excitations 1 meV we propose to use DCS to probe the energy and Q dependence of the magnetic excitations in NaErS2 Experiment Plan We propose to perform inelastic measurements down to 50 mK at both zero field and with an external magnetic field of 5 T The zero-field measurement will be useful to investigate the intrinsic short-range spin correlations and quantum dynamics A high field measurement will be crucial to elucidate the underlying magnetic exchange interactions through spin wave excitations in the polarized phase Since the crystals are small and fragile we plan to perform a 2D powder experiment that is to stack 200 pieces of the thin flake crystals 2g with a universal c-axis and randomly oriented ab axes The advantages of such a measurement over the conventional powder experiment is two-fold i due to the separation of in-plane and out-of-plane components the zero-field measurement will provide more information ii with the magnetic field applied along the shared global z-axis the high-field measurements will greatly simplify the problem of powder-average under external magnetic field because there will the same Zeeman energy for every Er3 spins We proposed 4 days of measurements 1st day cooling down the sample and measurement of excitations with i5  upon cooling 2nd day measure at base temperature of 50 mK 3rd day measure at base temperature with a 5T external magnetic field 4th day measure at 05 K and 20K respectively and perform an empty scan measurement at 20 K for background Reference  M Mourigal et al Phys Rev B 88 094407 2013 and references therein  R Coldea D A Tennant A M Tsvelik and Z Tylczynsk Phys Rev Lett 86 1335 2001  S Toth et al Phys Rev Lett 109 127203 2012  H D Zhou et al Phys Rev Lett106 147204 2011  J Ma et al Phys Rev Lett 116 8 087201  J A M Paddison et al Nature Physics 13 117-122 2017  W Liu Z Zhang et al Chin Phys Lett 35 117501 2018  Mitchell M Bordelon Stephen D Wilson et al Nature Physics 19 0594 2019  M Baenitz et al Phys Rev B 98 220409R 2018
