Neutron Spectroscopy of the Charge Disordered Pyrochlore 162Dy2ScNbO7 a Spin Ice Perturbation Cole Mauws Christopher Wiebe Introduction and state of science In pyrochlores of the form Dy2B2O7 and Ho2B2O7 where B is a non-magnetic transition metal the classical spin ice state is consistently seen The classical spin ice state is a well-studied magnetic glass that provides an opportunity to study magnetic monopolar quasiparticles that exist as a topologically protected excitation within spin ice This state is driven by the dipolar interaction of these large moment ions  10 B being larger than any exchange contribution  As such the magnetic ground state does not change in response to changes in lattice constant driven by B-site substitutions We have been studying the charge disordered pyrochlore Dy2ScNbO7 where a solid solution of non-magnetic ScIII and NbV occupy the B-site In this case of large chemically driven disorder on the B-site we observe glassy behavior distinct from the classical spin ice observed in all other dysprosium pyrochlores This provides an opportunity to study a perturbation on the classical spin ice which includes faster spin dynamics and therefore larger monopole concentrations if monopoles do still exist in this system Previous results Dy2ScNbO7 has been investigated by AC susceptibility specific heat measurements neutron diffraction and neutron crystal field spectroscopy AC susceptibility fig 1 right shows a frequency dependence which is not consistent with spin ice but shows an Arrhenius behaviour with an excitation energy of around 3 K Specific heat measurements show a peak around 12 K integration shows entropy release of roughly 90 of the spin ice entropy again showing this behaviour seems to a slight difference from spin ice Neutron diffraction was taken at HB-2A at dilution temperatures this data was taken on natural abundance dysprosium so the data quality is limited Diffuse scattering was observed fig 1 left which is not consistent with the well characterized spin ice scattering A rudimentary RMC fit was attempted due to the poor data quality the fit was largely disordered but did show a slight preference for anti-ferromagnetic nearest neighbor correlations This data will be improved with planned polarized experiments on the isotopically enriched sample Crystal field results on 162Dy2ScNbO7 from sequoia are the motivation for this study fig 2 In the parent compound Dy2Ti2O7 the lowest excited electronic state is at 20 meV  well separated from the ground state and no inelastic magnetic signature from the spin ice ground state is observable except quasielastic scattering at extremely low  1 eV energies  Our studies of Ln2ScNbO7 pyrochlores show that broad crystal fields are expected due to the chemical disorder however we see a new excitation appear in Dy2ScNbO7 centred at 52 meV with a FWHM of 64 meV significantly overlapping the ground state The excitation appears to be a crystal field however a better temperature dependence is required to determine whether it is magnetic in origin This low lying crystal field may provide a low energy non-Ising state which would partially explain the deviation from spin ice 02040608101214161820222400300035004000450050Int arb Q A-1 Figure 1 Left Magnetic diffuse scattering collected at HB-2A in a 1 mm annular can 005 10 K difference The red

52 meV with a FWHM of 64 meV overlapping the ground state Experimental We have prepared a 15 g sample of 162Dy2ScNbO7 powder for neutron scattering studies DCS is an optimal instrument for investigating this system as there should be a number of bright features at low Q that we want to investigate with good energy resolution including both inelastic scattering  5 meV and quasielastic scattering as a function of temperature in order to obtain the relaxation rates of these features We will use two wavelengths 24  will provide a resolution of 087 meV this will allow us to observe the full excitation at 5 meV and provide enough resolution to accurately fit the FWHM of the feature and hopefully observe any dispersion if it is present A wavelength of 8  provides a resolution of 30 eV This will allow us to observe if this 5 meV excitation is gapped away from the ground state Additionally we want to track the FWHM of the elastic line as a function of temperature as in Clancy et al  in order to track the spin dynamics as a function of temperature This resolution may still not be sufficient we plan to pair this experiment with another at the High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer
