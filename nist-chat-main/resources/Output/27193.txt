Understanding the Dynamics of phospholipid Liposomes with Amphiphilic Triblock copolymers Abstract The insertion of polymers dramatically changes the structure and dynamics of lipids in the bilayer of liposomes1-2 Understanding the interactions between liposomes and polymers is important for developing new technology that requires to design selective permeability This proposal concentrates on understanding the mechanism of insertion of amphiphilic tri block copolymers and the changes of dynamics of liposomal membranes due the insertion We would like to track the fast motion and the impact of polymers at length scale of the molecules The length-scale fits well to QENS experiments Existing result tell us about the importance to measure from around 100 ps to around 2-3 ns which is best compatible with HFBS at NIST-NCNR Scientific Importance The phospholipoid bilayer of biological cells is a very selective membrane whose important barrier function permits certain molecules to pass It is important for biology but also to develop new technology that requires to design selective permeability During my PhD work I synthesized a series of new triblock copolymers with the intention to insert these polymers in the bilayer and to test the impact on the local dynamics Therefore this proposal concentrates on the interaction studies of a series of triblock copolymers which will permit a selective and independent manipulation of the bilayer We use these liposomes as a very simple model for biological membrane Existing work which have studied model membrane interactions with triblock copolymers3 suggest that the major impact on elasticity originates from the entropic force that polymer chains in the aqueous phase impose on the membrane This results in a size reduction structural effect that we have also identified in our preliminary work which lessens the thermal undulations dynamics thus stiffens the membrane Following our recent work this should show a strong impact on the local dynamics measured at HFBS4 Our long-term focus is the fundamental understanding of the impact of the PEG blocks on the dynamics of the liposomes For that purpose this proposed experiment will be using three triblock copolymers consisting of hydrophobic PDMS middle block and hydrophilic PEG outer blocks For a systematic comparison of how the PEG affects the insertion and membrane dynamics we have kept the size of the PDMS block constant and varied the size of the PEG end blocks PDMS inserts into the hydrophobic section of the bilayer and at sufficiently large degrees of polymerization Figure 01 PEG can reach the aqueous phase while PDMS is only in the hydrophobic part of the bilayer In a simplified view we hypothesize that the PDMS part may modify the membrane fluidity based on the PEG block length which may also affect the formation of triblock copolymer domains within the bilayer This topic is addressed by a separate proposal However in order to accomplish progress in the PhD thesis QENS and SANS experiments are important The SANS experiments will tell us about domains while the QENS experiments provide independent information on the dynamics Even if the SANS work would not be accepted the QENS experiments determines the impact of the polymer on the dynamics The chemistry of the polymer has been characterized in detail already Thus this project can also lead to a separate publication We study only those materials that are compatible with our liposome For example longer PEG blocks would make the whole triblock copolymer soluble in water thus the driving force to insert the polymer into the bilayer disappears On the other hand if the polymer does not fit into the core it may destroy the liposomes The variation of the PEG length and topology permits to study the systematic increase of the entropic force Elastic incoherent neutron scattering allows one to analyze these motions as they fall in ps to ns time scale HFBS instrument at NIST NCNR is desirable for this study with the energy resolution of 08 eV Preliminary Work We have chosen well established model liposome in aqueous solution like DOPC 12-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in our recent paper4 We have synthesized three types of triblock copolymers with the composition of PEG-PDMS-PEG with changing hydrophobic to hydrophilic ratios PEG3-PDMS15_PEG3 PEG14-PDMS15-PEG14 PEG28-PDMS15-PEG28 DLS data suggests that while PEG28-PDMS15-PEG28 polymer aggregates into micelles of Zavg diameter of 15 nm PEG14-PDMS15-PEG14 polymer forms somewhat bigger aggregates like polymersomes of Zavg diameter of 100nm Fig 2 Our SANS data shows that doping DOPC vesicles with triblock copolymers resulted in only slight reduction of size Figure 03 Plus there was no contribution from free polymers More details would be taking from our currently undergoing analysis where we are using core-shell model4 Fig1 Schematic representation of possible interaction of triblock copolymers with lipid bilayer Hydrophobic block will be inserted into the bilayer and the hydrophilic block will be exposed to the polar exterior or interior If more than one chain is inserted also domains can form These hypotheses will be independently tested by SANS Figure 2 aDLS size distributions of PEG28-PDMS15-PEG28 micelles and PEG14-PDMS15-PEG14 vesicles bCryo-TEM images of vesicles formed by PEG14-PDMS15-PEG14 polymer a b Experiment Plan This proposal is purely on the local dynamics This is also an essential part of my PhD thesis Determination of the dynamics We will introduce three different selected concentrations of each polymer to 1 wt and 5 wt DOPC liposomes with a total of 12 samples The idea is to systematically study this change and to scale the motions with increase in polymer concentration QENS will be used to understand the change in undulation of the lipids in presence of triblock copolymer over a Q-range 07 - 13 -1  T  280 - 323 K over  20 eV We will also perform elastic scans around 08 eV to monitor any phase transition Following our previous experience3 we ask for 9 days of beam time at HFBS spectrometer at NCNR-NIST SLD  information of the
