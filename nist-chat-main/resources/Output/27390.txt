Background Mixed flow and deformation fields tend to convolute the data interpretation of dilatational rheology at the interface in the presence of interfacial systems with both finite surface shear and dilatational elasticity or G and K respectively Attempts have been made to resolve the anisotropic state of stress into their pure forms but few methods have succeeded without shortcomings Petkov et al proposed a method to resolve the surface shear and dilatational elasticity through orienting the Wilhelmy plate perpendicular and parallel to the moving barriers of the trough 1 However sometimes the anisotropic state is not as easily deconvoluted in the deformation field due to coupling of shear and dilatational flows and accurate plate orientation is difficult Pepicelli et al rid the trough complexities of uniaxial compression by proposing a Langmuir trough with radial symmetry and therefore isotropic compression Hence pure surface dilatational elasticity can be determined with homogenous compression 2 Due to the complexity in interpreting solely rheological data without a complementary method we have proposed to investigate structures of interfaces under homogenous flow Through a collaborative effort a homogenous compression trough or Quadrotrough with shear and dilatational capabilities is being developed as a sample environment on the horizontally-modified MAGIK or rheo-MAGIK Our hypothesis is that anisotropic compression will only affect the dilatational rheology for interfaces with finite surface shear moduli which cause convolution of mixed flow fields and complicate data interpretation On the other hand interfaces with none or negligible surface shear moduli should show isotherms that are path-independent meaning both isotropic and anisotropic compressions display identical isotherms A homogenous compression Langmuir trough or the Quadrotrough that we developed similar to the radial trough will be used in parallel with traditional Langmuir troughs to pursue our theory of homogenous versus non-homogenous compression Stearic acid was chosen as our model system due to it being a widely established system Besides the simplicity of this fatty acid past literature has shown that the shear rigidity of stearic acid films can be tuned through addition of salts in the water subphase3 For example when stearic acid is spread on pure water   02 dyncm at 20 2molecule but stearic acid measured   413 dyncm with the addition of Al3 in the subphase solution The tunability of the rheological properties allow drastic behaviors in the surface pressure isotherms but no conclusion on how the structural behavior of the interface differs for these monolayers For instrument development purposes we would like to test stearic acid interfaces under homogenous compression under salt and no salt conditions as one of the series of experiments to understand finite shear elasticity contributions to deformation flows Instrumentation Progress We recently implemented a dilatational and shear trough or Quadrotrough on the MAGIK neutron reflectometer modified for horizontal reflectometry for simultaneous characterization of surface rheology and interfacial structure as shown in Figure 1 The grand size of this neutron environment also can be accommodated successfully in MAGIK Furthermore with the combination of high flux and reflectometer set up we can reach a Qmax of 025 -1 which is necessary for resolving nanoscale features of surface-active species The instrument development process is currently ongoing and stearic acid serves as a reliable proof-of-concept model system for this hybridized instrument at the air-water interface A nickel film is also used in conjunction due to its distinct features in reflectivity Previous setup In previous liquid-rheological reflectivity measurements on MAGIK the incident intensity had large gaps as a function of incident angle due to physical gaps in the vertically-immobile segmented and focused monochromator assembly In order to cope with the missing data this creates the entire rheometer assembly was mounted on a vertical-translation stage This motion at the sample position compensated for the inability of the monochromator to be moved vertically The execution of reflectivity measurements was complicated by needing to do two sets of alignments two sets of incident beam scans etc followed by a manual stitching of the datasets together to patch over the gaps Current setup A major upgrade to the MAGIK instrument was undertaken in the summer and fall of 2019 in which a new monochromator assembly was installed which can be translated vertically to provide a smooth and relatively constant beam for any incident angle The rheometerreflectivity trough assembly can be mounted securely to a fixed stage that doesnt need to translate vertically and the experiment setup will be greatly simplified once a standard setup and operating procedure is established No data stitching will be required and the baseline alignment of the instrument should be very reproducible from measurement to measurement A sample pseudo-reflectivity curve of a nickel sample was used to show the success of the new set up Figure 2 Currently new protocols are under development for aligning the incident beam to the height of the liquid surface and carefully determining the zero-angle After these protocols are established further experiments should be greatly simplified and take less time Figure 1 a Setup of rheo-MAGIK b set

reflectivity curve of a nickel mirror that was tested in the middle of the sample environment using the newly improved rheo-MAGIK setup Preliminary Work The structural understanding of simple monolayers has often depended very little on direct characterizations Therefore most monolayers are arbitrarily labeled in their 2D phases and the region of buckling becomes hard to determine solely based on surface pressure isotherms Complementary studies are needed to resolve the structure of these different phases Experiments were performed on NG7 for deuterated stearic acid SLD 7194  106 2 spread on a low SLD aqueous solution 1  106 2 565656561 with alumina nitrate 10-4 M AlNO33 in the subphase Experiments were performed at 22  C The experiment successfully showed significant contrast in reflectivity curves at different compressions Fig 3 where higher compressions show significantly higher reflectivity curves This indicates that the molecules are more compact at higher compressions because of decrease in reflectivity curve fall off due to deuteration By fitting these curves we can obtain a more precise molecular area at each compressible condition Step compressions were also taken to determine the equilibrium surface pressures to create a static isotherm Figure 4 These measurements help determine relaxation times and equilibrium times of the interface which is needed for stability of the interface during neutron reflectivity measurements 000 005 010 015 020012345 AlNO33 subphase exp fit 2molecule 350 273 232 196 subphaseR100Q4Qz -1 Figure 3 Reflectivity spectra of

air-water interface with and without the addition of Al 3 salt at three compressions in each region of the isotherm which total to twenty experiments including two controls The experiment will be done at ambient conditions or 22  C in the Quadrotrough Each experiment requires 1 hour of equilibration and each experiment will require 8 hours of beam time to access a Q-range of 001 to 025 A-1 Due to the relatively new setup we request 2 extra day for alignment of the sample environment and sample environment setup We request a total of 10 days for beamtime including instrument development This work is of importance to the doctoral thesis of Ying-Heng Summer Tein and anticipate the results will be published in a high-impact journal due to its relevance pertaining to a novel instrument
