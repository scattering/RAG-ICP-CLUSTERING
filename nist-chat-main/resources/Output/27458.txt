Dielectric RheoSANS of Reverse Worm-like Micelles in Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear LAOS Noah Cho Jeffrey Richards1 1Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering Northwestern University Background Worm-like micelles WLMs are ubiquitous in consumer products and find industrial use as enhanced oil recovery surfactants and drag reducing agents due to their complex flow behavior This complexity arises as a result of their living nature which is driven by the reversible breakage and reformation of the worm-like chains and the ability to form branches These complexities have challenged researchers to develop theoretical models and experimental techniques in order to determine and prove the structural properties of WLMs1 Even though the micellar topology plays a critical role it is not well known how this topology evolves under simple shear In the quiescent state a topological transition from linear to branched WLMs occurs as the endcap energy of the micelles approaches the energy for branch formation This transition is commonly marked by a maximum in the zero-shear viscosity2 The increase in viscosity arises from micellar growth and entanglement and the maximum in viscosity occurs as micellar branches form that decreasing of the zero-shear viscosity by providing additional modes for stress relaxation due to the additional mobility of the branches along the chain backbone To date Cyro-TEM has been the preferred evidence of the linear to branched topological transition However direct imaging is not suitable for probing the evolution of topology during flow Goal of this Research We seek to measure the topological transition associated with the breaking of branch points during transient shear deformation It is thought that during transient deformations topologies that are not present in steady shear can appear We hypothesize that these non-equilibrium structures can be used to develop new constitutive relations to predict the response of worm-like micelles to arbitrarily complex deformations and ultimately improve our ability to predict their behavior Methods In order to achieve this goal we will perform a series of Dielectric RheoSANS measurements on WLMs consisting of soy lecithin water-in-oil microemulsions This system is particularly well suited for examining WLM micellar topology as the water contained within the core of the worms has a frequency dependent dielectric response that can be used to distinguish branching and segmental alignment during complex flow protocols We have exploited this dielectric sensitivity in the past to identify the presence and evolution of branching in using Dielectric RheoSANS in the steady shear deformation2 We are now interested in extending these techniques to transient flows including start-up and cessation and LAOS experiments Preliminary Work In preparation for this experiment we have measured the quiescent rheological and electrical properties of unbranched and branched WLMs in n-decane The linear viscoelastic properties of WLMs are widely used to prove the growth and topological transitions In figure 1a the zero-shear viscosity 0 is shown against the molar ratio of water to the lecithin W while varying the concentration of the lecithin surfactants The maximum values of the zero-shear viscosity indicate the branch formation at each concentration tested At larger W a decrease in the zero-shear viscosity indicates the formation of micellar branch points due to the extra component of the stress relaxation process As the number of branch points approaches the number of WLM segments the viscosity continues to decrease to the point of phase separation indicated by the vertical line These phase separation lines of water fraction increase with the concentration of surfactant By measuring the linear response of the worms as a function of water content inset of Figure 1b in a small amplitude oscillatory shear test we can extract the relaxation time R This time-scale defines the transition to from linear to non-linear flow via the Weissenberg number Wi the dimensionless shear rate This time-scale also defines the Deborah number De

frequency regimes By tuning the Wi and De numbers during a oscillatory shear test we can explore transient non-linear deformations An example is shown in Figure 1 c for De  01 and large Wi10 Under these conditions we observe features that are characteristic of worms in start-up flow Namely from point 1-2 the structural transitions from an entangled network to an unentangled network as indicated by the stress overshoot point 2 After the stress overshoot the disentangled chains align in the flow direction point 3 Finally as the cycle repeats the worms relax and re-entangle point 4 These qualitative microstructural transitions can be measured quantitatively with in situ dielectric spectroscopy As shown in Figure 1d Throughout the oscillation we see rich electrical behavior whose time-dependence can be reconstituted using a newly developed time-resolved rheoimpedance technique5 This allows the frequency dependent dielectric response of the worms to be measured at every time point throughout the oscillation There are three relaxations that characterize this dielectric response as shown in equation 1 eq 1 where is overall complex permittivity with all frequency ranges is the DC conductivity and are the dielectric strengths at medium and high frequency and are the relaxation times at medium and high frequency that encode information about important microstructural transitions including the breakagerecombination reptation dynamics and the segmental alignment The critical insight that we seek from a RheoSANS experiment is the correlation during transient flow between the segmental alignment of the worm-like chains and the  Recent work has shown that the link between a local maximum of the dielectric loss and structural anisotropy along the flow direction with liquid crystals at the high-frequency relaxation6 Leveraging the inverse system at the watersurfactantn-decane interface the dielectric relaxation at the high-frequency strongly depends on the rearrangement of local dipoles through water core This will give arise of changing the depolarization factor A between 13 to 1 when the chain aligns in the flow direction in-situ the oscillatory shear flows By combining the dielectric spectroscopy with Rheo-SANS we can get an access to the strong correlation between the interfacial polarization factor and the structural anisotropy factor while the nonlinear oscillatory shear deformation Experimental Plan We plan to use the ARES G2 dielectric RheoSANS instrument with the customized Labview Interface to construct the transient flow curve with shear rates ranging from 001 1s to 1000 1s From the startup oscillatory shear flow to the cessation of the shear flow with the given a frequency the dielectric properties will be monitored simultaneously Event mode SANS data will be collected continuously throughout the entire shear condition and triggering will be used to manually reset the clock using an analog output controlled via that Labview interface that corresponds directly with the rheometer clock These capabilities have been demonstrated in feasibility time In this way the neutron scattering measurement can be directly compared to both the dielectric and rheological test without discarding any of the transient information We plan to run 20 steady shear flow and three different magnitudes of the large amplitude of oscillatory shear flow with two different preparation of unbranched and branched solutions Due to the narrow aperture required for the ARES G2 Sample environment count rates are modest and therefore we require 1hour of steady shear at each point and transient flow Also in order to recover enough counting statistics each test should be repeated at least three times so that the error on the time-dependent microstructural changes can be counted In total we request for two samples three days of beam time to complete these measurements Reference 1 Cates M E Macromolecules 1987 20 2289-2296
