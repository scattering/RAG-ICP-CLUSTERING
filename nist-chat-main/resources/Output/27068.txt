Bio-polyelectrolytes with hydrophobic counterions influence of solvent quality and dielectric constant Scientific context and preliminary results Classical theories of polyelectrolytes calculate the properties by balancing elastic forces electrostatic repulsion and counterion entropy  These models have served as the main framework to understand the thermodynamic conformational and hydrodynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solutions over the last four decades However a number of experimentally observed phenomena remain unexplained by such models More recently the role of counter-ion solvation neglected in earlier models has received renewed attention2- The balance between counterion and polymer solvation forces is thought to be responsible for some of the unique and hitherto unexplained features of polyelectrolytes in solution including associative interchain forces responsible for the mysterious upturn at low-q observed in low-ionic strength polyelectrolyte solutions 25- Experimentally the role of counterion solvation on polymer conformation and solution structure remains largely unexplored SANS is a unique technique to explore this topic In the high q region where interchain correlations are not important SANS gives a direct measurement of the local conformation of chains In the mid-q region a correlation peak is observed for salt-free solution which gives a measure of the solution mesh size or correlation length The upturn at low-q while difficult to precisely interpret gives information about the nature of polyelectrolyte aggregates eg their fractal dimension Figure 1 shows how a sequential fitting procedure can be used to extract these different quantitates for sodium carboxymethyl cellulose NaCMC in salt-free D2O solution The purpose of this proposal is to study the effect of counterion solvation and dielectric constant on the solution properties of polyelectrolyte carboxymethyl cellulose a system which we have extensively studied as in earlier works 8-1 The sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose NaCMC dissolves readily in water it is insoluble in organic solvents Substituting Na counterions by for example tetrabutyl ammonium TBA ions yields TBACMC which is soluble in organic media Table 1 compiles the solubility of TBACMC in solvents of different dielectric constants Most solvents with e  20 solubilise TBACMC while those with e20 do not The increase in solubility for higher dielectric constant media is expected from Mannings condensation criteria There are deviations from the above rule for example Acetone e  21 does not dissolve TBACMC but propanol-2-ol e  18 does This reflects the fact that factors other than the dielectric constant including polarity and hydrogen bonds affect the solvation of polyelectrolytes In general protic solvents appear to solubilised TBACMC better than aprotic ones Figure 2 shows the specific viscosity of TBACMC as a function of the dielectric constant of the solvent For media that does not fully solubilise TBACMC viscosity measurements are not possible we include these data as blue symbols swollen or red symbols completely insoluble A positive correlation between the solvent dielectric constant and the specific viscosity of the solvent is observed Following the Rouse-Zimm model of polyelectrolyte dynamics  the higher viscosities with increasing dielectric constant correspond to an increase in the chain dimensions The viscosity increases in an approximately exponential fashion in the e20 region Experiments proposed In order to systematically study the influence of counterion and polymer solvation on the structure of polyelectrolyte solutions we will first measure the influence of solvent type on the scattering properties of TBACMC for the solvents listed in Table 1 except dipropylene glycol which is not available in d-form plus acetonitrile ethylene glycol methanol and ethanol at a fixed concentration of 2wt which is well above the overlap concentration 9 samples From these measurements we will combine viscosity and correlation length data which following Dobrynins scaling model can be used to estimate single chain dimensions in non-entangled solution In order to understand the effects of counterion solvation and dielectric constant on the conformation and concentration fluctuations of polyelectrolytes we will carry out three experiments that vary the relevant parameters independently I Influence of counter-ion hydrophobicity at fixed dielectric constant and solvent polarity Counterion hydrophobicity will be changed by using tetra- methyl ethyl butyl and propyl ammonium salts of CMC Experiments will be carried out in salt-free D2O at four different concentrations 16 samples Data will be compared to results for NaCMC which have been previously acquired II Influence of proticaprotic solvents at fixed dielectric constant The dielectric constant of mixtures of propan-1-ol and acetone is approximately independent of solvent composition Propan-1-ol is a solvent for TBACMC but acetone is not presumably because the former is a protic solvent and the latter is aprotic We will measure 5 solvent compositions at fixed polymer concentration 2wt TBACMC is soluble from 25 propanol 6 samples III Influence of dielectric constant for a fixed solvent The dielectric constant of NMF can be varied from e200 to e100 by changing the temperature between 5oC to 85oC corresponding to a change of 75 in the Bjerrum length We will measure TBACMC at a single concentration in intervals of 10oC Given the relatively large residual salt content of NMF we will carry out these measurements at a high polymer concentration of 5wt 9 samples The total number of samples is 9 16  6 9  40 An additional 9 solvents and one cell background must be measured We will measure at 3 sample to detector distances to cover 0003-1 q05-1 The acquisition times are  15 hrs for samples at 2 wt and 45 min for samples at 5wt For T-runs we estimate an additional 10 minutes per sample for temperature equilibration Taking into the samples temperatures and solvent backgrounds we estimate a total acquisition time of 67 hours Including beamline setup and sample changes we request 3 days at NGB30 Bibliography  Dobrynin AV Rubinstein M 2005 Theory of polyelectrolytes in solutions and at surfaces Prog Pol Sci 3011 pp1049-1118  Chremos A Douglas JF
