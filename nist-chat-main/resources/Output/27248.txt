 Page 1 of 2 Spin Dynamics in Triangular-Lattice Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate NaYbS2 Scientific background Geometrical frustration causes macroscopic degeneracy and or strong quantum fluctuations of the ground state GS of a spin system thus makes the ground-state magnetism highly exotic 1 Under normal circumstances the spontaneous symmetry breaks when the temperature decreases below the scale of the magnetic coupling JkB and the spin system approaches to its GS Currently the GSs of many geometrically frustrated Ising spin systems such as triangular kagome and pyrochlore Ising antiferromagnets were calculated to be completely disordered and macroscopically degenerated 3 However the macroscopic GS degeneracy of a classical Ising system may be easily lifted by various kinds of perturbations such as the second-neighbor interaction and bond randomness which are usually inevitable in a real material 5 Resonating valence bond RVB GS was first proposed by P W Anderson in 1973 as the prototype of a quantum spin liquid QSL in the triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnetic THAF model  A RVBQSL state is a superposition of many different partitions of the system into valence bonds where spins are strongly entangled up to long distances and time without conventional symmetry breaking and residual entropy even down to 0 K The recent numerical studies spoke against the formation of the QSL GS in the THAF model and consistently revealed a long-range Nel 120 ordered GS 8 Due to the strong spin frustration the calculated order parameter is much smaller than that in the classical case suggesting the ideal THAF model is already very close to the quantum critical point between magnetic ordered and disordered phases Therefore a slight modification of the spin Hamiltonian in a real triangular antiferromagnetic compound may induce stronger quantum fluctuations and may support the QSL GS And the exploration of the suitable triangular antiferromagnet materials is fundamental to experimentally realize the QSL state and or to compare among various theoretical numerical results YbMgGaO4 was proposed as the first structurally perfect rare-earth triangular antiferromagnet with the highly symmetric space group of R-3m which has invoked a further interest in the search of spin liquids with strong spin-orbit coupling 1 However there is debate as to whether GaMg disorder induces the disordered spin state andor QSL stability The rare-earth chalcogenides NaReS2 Re  Yb Er etc have also a hexagonal structure with the space group of R-3m and naturally removes the issue of GaMg disorder proposed for YbMgGaO4 As shown in Fig 1 the Re3 ions form a triangular lattice in the ab plane and are well separated by the nonmagnetic A-site Na ions Therefore large degeneracy to the ground state of this material could be presented and the induced strong quantum effects could lead to exotic physical properties Specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements on the single crystals and polycrystals revealed no structural or magnetic transition down to 50 mK Therefore the system is an ideal platform for the research of QSLs and its promising applications and it is very interesting to obtain the dynamic spectra of the system The common approaches to identify a spin liquid exploring the wave-vector and intensity dependence of the materials dynamical spin response by inelastic neutron scattering is the most promising one Preliminary Work We have successfully synthesized NaReX2 Re rare earth X S Se single crystals as shown in Fig2 where we present the single-crystal NaYbS2 After grounded the small crystals into powder we carried out X-ray diffraction The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern has a goodness-of-fit The specific heat and Fig 1 The crystal structure of NaReSe2 Page 2 of 2 magnetic susceptibility data did not reveal structural or magnetic transition down to 50 mK The Curie-Weiss fitting from T  150-300 K reveals a Curie temperature of CW  -6374 K with an effective moment of eff  482 B The spin dynamics of the powder sample has been measured which has the signal up to 1meV at 50 mK Fig2 b and the phase diagram has been obtained Choice of Instrument We propose to use the cold-neutron time-of-flight Disk Chopper Spectrometer DCS to measure the spin dynamics of single-crystal NaYbS2 This instrument is well-suited for performing this inelastic measurement around the energy range of interest Using the flux our collaborator from the Institute of Physics Dr Qingming Zhang has synthetized 1g co-aligned single-crystal NaYbS2 The samples will be aligned on HHL plane the magnetic field applied along 1-1 and the samples maintained below T  01 K using a dilution refrigerator To measure the gapless modes we will keep wavelength  6  23 meV for DCS to achieve the best accessible energy resolution A magnet with DR insert cryostat will be applied As the spin-12 triangular antiferromagnet is a central model in quantum condensed matter physics and the quantum spin liquid phase one of the best example yet elusive exotic quantum state we anticipate our work will attract a lot of interest from experimentalists and theorists alike Estimate of the measurement times We estimate that 23 h of data acquisition for about 90 degrees with 15minsdegree will be necessary to map the spin dynamics at base temperature with several magnetic fields 0T 4T and 8T Including the background measurement at 10K and experiment setup we estimate that 4 days of beam time will be necessary Recommended safety
