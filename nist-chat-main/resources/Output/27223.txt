Spin dynamics in dysprosium gallium and aluminum garnets Pyrochlore materials have attracted a lot of attention in the condensed matter community in the recent years Their magnetic properties inherited from those of rare earth ions have led to a flurry of discoveries in frustrated magnetism as for instance the concept of emergent quantum electrodynamics 12 Besides the pyrochlore structure formed by corner-sharing tetrahedra the hyperkagome structure made of corner-sharing triangles is another network prone to geometric frustration  whether or not the concepts developed in the context of pyrochlores might be adapted to this structure represents an important issue In gallium and aluminum rare-earth R garnets RAG and RGG space group Ia-3d the R ions occupy the vertices of triangles organized in two nested hyperkagome subnetworks as shown on Figure 1 The unusual symmetry of the crystal field produces different local anisotropy axes all aligned along the cubic axes  magnetic moments on the R sites forming a triangle point in orthogonal directions Figure 1 In most RGGs or RAGs  this multi-axis antiferromagnetic structure with three sets of antiparallel spins is the ground state and long-range magnetic ordering is observed at subkelvin temperatures Mean-field calculations based on dipolar interactions have been performed to understand the stability of this ground state and its behavior in applied magnetic field 5  with reasonable success However to our knowledge there is no published experimental investigation of the spin excitations in the ordered magnetic phase of gallium or aluminum garnets so that the Hamiltonian proposed in  as well as the strength of the R-R dipolar interactions and the possible role of other terms still remain to be established Today very few inelastic neutron scattering investigations of garnets can be found in the literature  examples are Gd3Ga5O12 which actually remains in a spin liquid state down to 006 K  or crystal field studies of Tb3Ga5O12  and Er3Ga5O12  Figure 1 Magnetic structure of DyAG together with a sketch of the hyperkagome networks in orange and blue Yellow dark blue and red spheres represent Dy atoms with spins aligned along a b or c respectively Figure 2 Evolution with temperature of the neutron diffractogram of DyAG in the vicinity of TN G41  LLB Inset  Corresponding magnetic moment vs temperature  Figure 3 Evolution with temperature of the neutron diffractogram of DyGG in the vicinity of TN G41  LLB Inset  Corresponding magnetic moment vs temperature  Figure 4  Dy crystal field excitations in a powder sample of Dy3Ga5O12 measured at 5 K on the thermal triple axis spectrometer 2TLLB E scan at constant Q  21 -1 To get a better understanding of the exchange Hamiltonian at play we have started to investigate two dysprosium garnets in parallel Dy3Al5O12 DyAG and Dy3Ga5O12 DyGG to better identify the impact of the Dy3 local environment on the crystal field levels and the Dy3 magnetic anisotropy tensor Neutron powder diffraction experiments have already been performed and have confirmed for both the multi-axis antiferromagnetic structure Figure 1 with TN  23 K for DyAG and TN  04 K for DyGG Crystal field excitations up to 50 meV 2TLLB have also been studied for both compounds see Figure 4 for instance Our results are in perfect agreement with previous spectroscopic experiments 1 Moreover they also suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in DyAG is Ising like as expected whereas it is XY like in nature in DyGG hence the low ordered moment value at 32 mK 31 B instead of 10 see Figure 3 Proposed experiment We now wish to carry out inelastic neutron scattering investigations at low energy to map out the spin excitations spectrum and determine the magnetic interactions at play To this end we will use the simulation tools developed at LLB spinwave and cefwave combined with our knowledge of the ordered magnetic structure and of the CEF scheme A cold time-of-flight spectrometer with good energy resolution is needed such as DCS operated with  5 or 6  as we expect the signal to be stay in the 0-2 meV range We plan to record spectra at various temperatures below and above TN for both compositions using different resolution conditions if necessary For this study we estimate that we would need 3 days of beamtime with a cryostat DyAG and another 4 days of beamtime with a dilution fridge DyGG We have 2g of powder for each composition References  Introduction to Frustrated Magnetism edited by C Lacroix P Mendels and F Mila Springer-Verlag Berlin 2011  L Balents Nature 464 199 2010  M Gingras et al Rep Prog Phys 77 056501 2014  J Hammann thse CEA R3866 1969  HW Capel Phys Lett 11 7 1964  HW Capel Physica 31 1152 1965  E Bidaux et al J Phys 29 57 1968  J Phys 29 357 1968  PD Deen et al Phys Rev B 82 174408 2010  R Wawrzynczak et al Phys Rev B 100 094442 2019  Y Cai et al to appear in Phys Rev B 2019 1 P Grunberg et al Phys Rev 184 285 1969
