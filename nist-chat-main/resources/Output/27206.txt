1 Effect of Ionomer Content on Water Dynamics in Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers Polymer electrolyte fuel cells PEFCs have attracted a great deal of attention as clean and sustainable energy conversion devices Fuel cells emit only water so there are no carbon dioxide emissions and no air pollutants that cause global warming and health problems at the point of operation A critical component of the PEFC is the catalyst layer which is generally composed of Pt nanoparticles on carbon supports PtC and perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers such as Nafion A Pt catalyst at the anode separates hydrogen molecules into protons and electrons each taking a different path to the cathode The electrons go through an external circuit creating a flow of electricity The protons migrate through the electrolyte ionomer membrane to the cathode where they unite with oxygen and the electrons to produce water Figure 1a PtC particles are covered by ionomer layers thickness is from nm to several tens nm Since proton and oxygen transfer within ionomer the transport property decides the power generation performance Although it is desirable to increase the content of ionomer to improve proton conductivity oxygen permeability decreases Figure 1band c Thats why the structure control of the ionomer which balances oxygen permeability with proton conductivity in catalyst layers is necessary for the improvement of the performance Previous work We prepared catalyst ink by mixing the catalyst powder that consists of primary PtC particles in dispersion media that are mixtures of water and alcohol The catalyst layer CL structure depends on catalyst ink composition the ratio of water and alcohol The catalyst slurries are prepared for changing the wateralcohol ratio of the solvent to control the contents of ionomers on PtC composites The content of ionomer on PtC particles decreases with an increase in the alcohol ratio of solvent  And then the slurries are dried out to make the catalyst layer We investigated the proton transport Figure 1 a Schematic representation of a typical cathode catalyst layer structure Effects of Low b and high c distribution of ionomer on PtC on proton and oxygen transports 2 resistance as a function of the ratio of the amounts of ionomers and PtC particles The proton transport resistance decreases as the content of ionomer on PtC particles increases at RH 90 Figure 3 This indicates that the proton transport is dominated mainly by the adsorbed amount of the ionomers on CPt particles Water dynamics in hydrated Nafion membranes have been studied by QENS 23 Furthermore the local dynamics of water molecules was found to be strongly coupled with proton transport property  However the thin film-like structure of ionomers as in the catalyst layer has different water uptake and proton transport properties compared to the bulk membrane 5 The effect of ionomer content on the water dynamics in fuel cell catalyst layers is therefore of great interest in understanding the proton-conduction mechanism based on the migration of hydrated protons However this is not well understood and there is little published literature on the effect of ionomer content on the catalyst on water dynamics Proposed Work In this work we investigate water dynamics in ionomers of catalyst layers used in fuel cells by quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS QENS is one of the most powerful experimental techniques to investigate the nano- to pico-second molecular dynamical behavior in confined geometries that strongly affects the structural and dynamical behavior of water molecules Using two types of catalyst layers which represent high and low contents of ionomers on PtC composites we can compare the effects of ionomer content on water dynamics First we measure the elastic fixed window scan to see the temperature dependence of water dynamics of two kinds of catalyst layers We expect that the mean square displacement MSD will behave very differently 1 water absorbed in high content ionomer will freeze at a lower temperature than bulk water 2 water absorbed in low content ionomer may not freeze due to the confinement effect As a result the temperature dependence of MSD is clear Figure 3 Proton transport resistance as a function of the ratio of the amounts of Ionomers and CarbonPt particles IC Figure 2 SEM of cross section of cathode catalyst layers waterethanol weight ratios of 1000 left and 8515 right  3 compared to water in higher content ionomer As for the QENS profiles we will fit the data with a delta and Lorentzian function and evaluate the elastic incoherent structure factor EISF And then we will calculate the diffusion behavior or local motion from the Q dependence We will estimate the ratio of free water to bound water from the intensity of the Lorentzian function We expect the diffusive motion of water in high content ionomer shows bulk-like behavior at the molecular level In contrast water motions in low content ionomer show significantly decreasing the diffusion coefficient due to the strong effect of confinement The QENS data should be able to clarify all of these aspects We try to find the link between the performance of fuel cells and the dynamics of water in the catalyst layer from the point of content of ionomers on PtC We request beam time on both the HFBS and DCS spectrometers because we expect relaxation times of confined water or absorbed water and bulk-like water are in eV and meV region respectively On HFBS we will run both fixed window scans FWS of 4 materials and full dynamics scans of the two materials At 12 hours per FWS for each material plus 8 hours per inelastic spectra X 4 temperatures and resolution we request five days on HFBS We will then collect full inelastic spectra each of the two materials on the DCS spectrometer using 6-angstrom neutrons for higher temperatures At 8 hours per spectrum X 2 materials X 4 measurements per material and resolution we request three days on DCS References  M Kishi S Moriyama T Mori J Soc Powder Technolol Japan 2018 55 7 366-374  Pivovar A A Pivovar B S J Phys Chem B 2005 109 2 785793  Perrin J C Lyonnard S Volino
