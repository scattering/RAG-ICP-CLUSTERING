1 Structure of Cellulose Block Copolymers in Solutions Xin Zhang Doug Henderson Robert M Briber Howard Wang Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Maryland College Park MD 20742 Cellulose is the most abundant natural organic polymer on earth it has been used in applications such as clothing packaging foods construction pharmaceuticals and cosmetics1-3 Large-scale production and utilization of cellulose as plastics replacement is widely considered among the most promising path toward a sustainable future for such practice would simultaneously achieve the reduction of plastics pollution and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon However because of difficulties in processing molecular cellulose the use of cellulose materials has been limited mostly to the pristine form Hybrid composites of cellulose fibers and synthetic polymers would be an intermediate step toward the eventual plastics replacement in which block copolymers of cellulose and polymer could play the role of compatibilizing the otherwise immiscible pair of cellulose and plastics It has been a big challenge to synthesize well-defined cellulose block copolymers CBCs We have successfully synthesized for the first time diblock and triblock copolymers containing the oligomeric cellulose with 7 average glucose units DP7 PDI101 and PEO of 2k 5k and 10 kgmol respectively Molecular characteristics of polymers are best characterized in dilute coil solutions DP7 is not soluble in pure water but completely dissolves in DMSO at 60 oC or higher As a result there are preferential interactions among two blocks and two solvents diblock copolymer DP7-PEO10k DBP10k is most soluble in water whereas triblock DP7-PEO2k-DP7 TBP2k is more compatible with DMSO than water We have carried out preliminary SAXS and SANS measurements on solutions of block components as well as selected DBPs and TBPs In this proposed experiment CBC solutions will be measured at two polymer concentrations several solvent mixing ratios and at various temperatures The solution morphology and conformation of CBCs will be examined as a function temperature solvent quality and Mw The interactions Flory-Huggins interaction parameter c  between blocks the degree of polymerization of the block co-polymer determine the structure of the overall polymer Preliminary SANS have shown that DP7 Figure 1 yellow and TBP2k Figure 1 red form solution in DMSO Details of solution behavior has yet to be systematically studied SANS is preferred over SAXS for studying polymer solutions in DMSO because of sulfurs very strong x-ray absorption Furthermore for multicomponent polymers SANS takes advantage of the contrast matching to measure structure of each component independently Cellulose has a neutron scattering length density SLD of 176  10-6 A-2 if the hydroxyl groups on cellulose are deuterated during the measurement the SLD becomes 3455  10-6 A-2 PEG has a SLD 0636  10-6 A-2 D2O has a SLD of 6402  10-6 A-2 dDMSO has a SLD of 528  10-6 A-2  and DMSO has a SLD of -004228  10-6 A-2  By using D2O as a solvent the contrast will be largely between the PEG and deuterated surroundings the SLD of core corona and solvent are 3455  10-6 A-2 0636  10-6 A-2 and 6402  10-6 A-2 as shown in Figure 2A But PEG is expected to mix with D2O and the SLD of PEG corona becomes 3528 Figure 1 SANS on DP7 PEG and TBP solutions in D2O and dDMSO 2 x10-6 A-2 assuming the PEG corona is made of 11 PEG and D2O Cellulose core is expected to be crystalline in D2O and SLD stays at 3455  10-6 A-2 as shown in Figure 2B It is expected to observe typical sphere scattering with Rg of the whole micelle DMSO can be added to the system to make the corona or core more dominant DMSO prefers associating with cellulose as a result by adding small amount of dDMSO assuming the core is consisted of 50 of dDMSO corona is consisted of 11 D2OPEG and solvent environment is not significantly affected the SLD of core corona and environment are 43675 x10-6 A-2 3528 x10-6 A-2 and 6402 x10-6 A-2 illustrated in Figure 2C It is expected to observe typical sphere scattering with Rg of the whole micelle as the contrast between core and corona is small and the boundary between core and corona is smeared due to dynamics of the molecules However if the dDMSO concentration is higher than assumed 50 typical shell scattering is expected In the case of TBPs the micelles are expected to form very large scale structures due to bridging between TBC micelles which shows up in low q or USANS range In the case of DMSO added to the solution the scattering length densities of core with 11 DMSOcellulose corona of 11 PEGD2O and environment becomes 17061  10-6 A-2 3528 x10-6 A-2 and 6402  10-6 A-2 illustrated in Fig 2D As a result the core and D2O sovent has the highest contrast and characteristic bead with smeared surface layer scattering is expected Similarly in case of TBC micelles large structure can show up in low q or USANS range The scattering length densities of possible composition are listed in Table 1 Table 1 Scattering Length Densities Composition SLD  10-6 A-2 D2O 6402 dDMSO 5427 DMSO -0042 PEG 0636 Partial deuterated cellulose 3455 Partial deuterated cellulose  dDMSO 11 4368 Partial deuterated cellulose  DMSO 11 1706 PEG  D2O 11 3528 Oligomeric cellulose PEGs of different molecular weight triblock copolymers and diblock copolymers of different molecular weight will be measured in solutions of D2O dDMSO mixture of D2O with dDMSO and mixture of D2O with DMSO The compositions of samples are listed in Table 2 Figure 2 Contrast between CBC micelles and D2O environment 3 Measurements The structure of solvent mixtures and coil solutions is proposed be studied using the 30m SANS instrument covering the Q-range from 001 to 4 nm-1 SANS will be measured at temperatures 293 K 323K 348K and 373 K for all samples All samples will be prepared in two concentrations 1wt and 2wt  In addition solution to look into the dissolution morphology The total sample number including pure solvent for background will be 32 samples With SANS we anticipate observing features of either coil or micelle structure scattering their corresponding Q-range in dDMSO or D2O solutions Results from this study will allow a better understanding of the conformation of cellulose and PEG based TBP and DBP in solution and can be applied to future design of nanostructured cellulose based polymers Beam Time Request We will prepare a total of 32 samples 8 different types of polymers 2 concentrations each plus solvent dDMSO D2O D2O with DMSO added D2O with dDMSO added solvents for this study All samples excluding dDMSO solvent background will be scanned at 4 different temperatures assuming 30 minutes for each sample the total is 64 hours Adding time for sample changing empty beam empty cell and solvent measurement all time needed is estimated to be around 3 days Combining sample variations in compositions and temperature variations in measurements we request 3 days of 30m SANS beamtime for these experiments Selected samples that shows strong low q signal will be further investigated with USANS and 4 days of USANS beam time is also requested References 1 Klemm D Heublein B Fink H P Bohn A Angew Chem Int Ed 2005 44 3358-3393 2 Habibi Y Lucia L A Rojas O J Chem Rev 2010 110 3479-3500 3 Gericke M
