Study on Anisotropic Gap in detwinned FeSe Tong Chen and Pengcheng Dai Rice University Morten Eskildsen Notre Dame Scientific Background In conventional superconductors the superconductivity results from electrons forming Cooper pairing through phonon-mediated attractive interaction In high-temperature high-Tc superconductors although the precise mechanism responsible for the formation of the superconducting condensate remains an area of ongoing research vast experimental efforts over the past decades have shown that the magnetism plays a critical role within the physics of high-Tc superconductivity 1- For iron-based superconductors one key challenge however is to experimentally identify the symmetry of the superconducting gap Although angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ARPES and scanning tunneling microscope STM experiments can in principle reveal the gap symmetry of a superconductor the surface sensitive nature of these techniques has severely damped the progress in sorting out the gap symmetry of many interesting superconductors Most underdoped iron-based superconductors exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition at TS  300 K and form twinned domains before ordering antiferromagnetically at TN TN  TS Therefore we must detwin the iron-based superconductors to study the intrinsic electronic and thermodynamic properties below TS which makes it more challenging to decide the symmetry of the superconducting gap While STM measurements can resolve this problem by looking a small region of the sample typical ARPES measurements will average twin-domains and therefore be unable to resolve the momentum dependence of the gap function unambiguously By applying a uniaxial pressure along one axis of the orthorhombic lattice to detwin the sample an in-plane resistivity anisotropy has been observed in detwinned iron pnictides BaFe2-xTxAs2 T is Co or Ni above TS 4 Using uniaxial pressured detwinned sample neutron scattering experiments reveal that the resonance coupled to superconductivity only occurs along the AF ordering direction thus suggesting that superconductivity is orbital selective and occurs mostly along the AF ordering 10 direction 6 Similar measurements in detwinned FeSe show similar behavior  This means that the superfluid density of the system will be different between in the in-plane directions The London penetration depth will also be different between 10 and 01 directions One powerful technique that may help us to tackle the problem of the gap symmetry is small-angle neutron scattering SANS to study the vortex lattice VL  Since the vortices can be pinned by disorder or boundaries between different domains such measurements in iron-based superconductors are only possible on the purest samples such as KFe2As2 1 Although FeSe can be made extremely pure the twin boundary will trap the flux lattice and thus make typical small angle neutron scattering experiment untenable Previous Results By gluing many oriented FeSe single crystals on uniaxially pressured BaFe2As2 single-crystalline substrates we were able to simultaneously detwin many FeSe single crystals required for inelastic neutron scattering INS experiments Fig 1a  Panel b c and d shows the resistivity and anisotropy measured on a single piece of FeSe single crystal using the method above As we can see theres obvious anisotropy induced and compared to mechanically pressuredpulled results the FeSe single crystals should be 100 detwinned Also since the spin excitations from BaFe2As2 is fully gapped below 10 meV at base temperature 3 K and it is not superconducting the signal in INS experiments below 10 meV we saw and potential scattering from VL in SANS experiments will be from FeSe only Proposed Experiment Here we propose to perform exploratory SANS studies of the VL in detwinned FeSe We coaligned 300 mg FeSe samples on BaFe2As2 substrates with a special aluminum clamp to apply uniaxial pressure on the substrates to detwin FeSe While the vortex pinning problem and the large penetration depth will complicate the condition it is likely that the pinning in the boundaries will be eliminated by the detwinning and the weakness of the signal will be compensated by the amount of the samples We propose to measure the temperature and field dependence of the VL symmetry and the scattered intensity form factor The VL symmetry will provide information about the anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the applied fields whereas the field dependence of the form factor will allow a determination of the superconducting characteristic length scales Finally the temperature dependence will provide information about the locations and dispersion of gap nodes For our purpose we request 3 days on SANS
