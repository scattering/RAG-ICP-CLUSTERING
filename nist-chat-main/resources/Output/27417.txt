Powder Neutron Diffraction of CaLnMReO6 Ln  Pr and Nd M  Mn Co and Ni Fang Yuan and Corey Thompson Department of Chemistry Purdue University Background Double perovskites DPs AABBO6 have drawn increasing attention for being promising candidates as spin glasses and multiferroic materials for spintronics and data storage1-3 The Goldschmidt tolerance factor t  rAA  rO2rBB  rO is an indicator of stability for crystal structures of perovskites and has been widely used to describe perovskite structures When t is close to 1 DPs adopt ideally cubic Fm-3m structure Fig 1 while a distorted crystal structure could be formed as t becomes smaller than 1 Ca2MReO6 with orthorhombic structure M  Mn Co and Ni were first reported in 19624 Subsequently Kato et al displayed the physical properties of monoclinic Ca2MnReO6 and Ca2CoReO65 These examples exhibit how the difference in structure can be achieved via different synthetic methods The substitution of A-site elements has been an effective way of developing novel double perovskites The A-site cation can influence both the crystal structure and magnetic properties via octahedral tilting The investigation of rare-earth Ln elements substituting for Ca deserves special attention in terms of magnetism studies since majority of rare earth elements carry localized magnetic moments Ionic radii of Ln elements are comparable to that of Ca2 ions Ca-112  Ln  Pr-1126  Nd-1109  Therefore preparation of mixed A-cation double perovskites is feasible The known Ca2MReO6 phases are ferromagnetic caused by magnetic interactions from M-site elements5 How would these properties change with influence of a magnetic rare-earth element on the A-site To study the influence of magnetic Ln elements substitution for Ca on the structural and magnetic properties we have synthesized six new Re-based double perovskites CaLnMReO6 Ln  Pr and Nd M  Mn Co and Ni Room-temperature powder XRD suggests that all of the CaLnMReO6 phases crystallize in the P21n-type structure consisting of alternating corner-shared MO6 and ReO6 octahedra Fig 1 As shown in Figure 2 a significant divergence of ZFC-FC curves were observed for the six Re-based DPs Figure 1 X-ray powder diffraction pattern of CaLnMReO6 left Crystal structures of BaLaMReO6 Fm-3m and CaLaMReO6 P21n right Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show magnetic transitions below 220 K The two Mn phases and CaPrCoReO6 are ferro- or ferri-magnetic while the other three phases exhibit ferriferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transitions Field dependence measurements show metamagnetic transitions indicating possible spin-reorientation Fig 3 The magnetization of the phases is not saturated up to 7 T at 2 K suggesting the coexistence of competitive antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling To systematically investigate the structure-magnetic properties relationship of CaLnMReO6 Ln  Pr and Nd M  Mn Co and Ni we propose to conduct neutron powder diffraction on the six samples The Figure 2 Temperature dependence of magnetization measured in 1000 Oe upon ZFC and FC for CaPrMnReO6 a CaPrCoReO6 b CaPrNiReO6 c CaNdMnReO6 d CaNdCoReO6 e and CaNdNiReO6 f Figure 3 Field dependence of magnetization measured at 2 K for CaPrMnReO6 a CaPrCoReO6 b CaPrNiReO6 c CaNdMnReO6 d CaNdCoReO6 e and CaNdNiReO6 f objective of this neutron proposal is to correlate the magnetic properties with the crystal structure Thus with these measurements we seek to solve the magnetic structures obtain ordered moments and investigate the Ln influence on structure and magnetic properties To the best of our knowledge all of these compounds are new and no physical properties have been reported Our goals as listed above will be fulfilled with the help of neutron experiments We believe that this work will contribute to understanding the influence of rare earth substitution for non-magnetic A-site elements on the structural and physical properties of DPs Choice of Instrument The BT-1 high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer is ideally suited for studying both crystal and magnetic structures of double perovskite oxides This diffractometer can provide high resolution in a wide 2-theta window Experimental Plan To obtain accurate crystal and magnetic structures we propose to perform neutron diffraction experiments using the Ge 311 monochromator at the BT-1 instrument Measurements from 5 K to 300 K at 50 K increments will be performed on each sample for 4 hours each scan at wavelength 2079  Ge 311 In total we request seven days to measure all six samples 1 daysample This includes heating and cooling sample changes and measurements We have already prepared 3 grams of each sample Reference 1 Vasala S Karppinen M Progress in solid state
