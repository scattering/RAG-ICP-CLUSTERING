at Austin 2 National Institute of Standards and Technology 3 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Problem Statement and Objectives Production of shale oil and shale gas have played an important role in the US and global energy supply because of the application of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well In hydraulic fracturing however only a small fraction 10-15 of water injected flows back meaning a big amount of water stays in the formation These water can be accommodated in fracturesmicrofractures and can also be imbibed into the shale matrix Water imbibition in shale matrix is a complicated process with many influencing factors including pore size pore connectivity and wettability which in turn is related to the shale mineralogy organic matter distribution and pore type in the formation Water imbibition can displace the gas or oil in-place and therefore is favorable for hydrocarbon production in the initial phase However when more water intake occurs it will cause water blockage near the fractures and therefore impedes hydrocarbon production Our previous works show that water imbibition can occur in the matrix with different pattern of spatial distribution that is associated with the sample mineralogy and pore structure however how deep and how fast the imbibition can occur and displace gasoil in-place is still unclear Therefore investigation of water imbibition in shale that is pre-saturated with gas or oil is highly needed to better understand the influence of water imbibition in shale oil and gas production Because of the very small pore size nano-scale and small porosity 8-10 of the shale sample how effectively neutron imaging can detectmeasure the wateroil or watergas interface in the shale matrix is unknown Most previous studies using neutron imaging are focused on the water imbibition in fractures eg DiStefano et al 2017 whereas water imbibition in the matrix is lacking In this proposed work we will conduct feasibility study on the measurementcharacterization of water imbibition dynamics in shale matrix using neutron radiography The coupling application of X-ray radiography will also be tested The specific goal is to determine the optimal neutron imaging settings including pixel and temporal resolution and the sample size for the study of water imbibition in shale matrix Previous Work Our previous works are focused on the pore structure connectivity in shale and their influence on permeability based on oil imbibition Peng et al 2017 Peng et al 2019a Influence of wettability and local mineralogy and pore structure on wateroil displacement Peng et al 2019b using the integrated method of micro-CT and oil-tracer imbibition is also investigated 2 Many new insights have been gained through these studies For example although it is commonly understood that shale contains significant heterogeneity in different length scales we found that the dominant pore structure in shale can be homogeneous in millimeter-scale Fig 1a Dominant porosity can be defined through the image analysis and is found to be more relevant to the permeability than the total porosity Fig 1b Figure 1 a Relative uniform distribution of the dominant pore network in an Eagle Ford Shale sample b A positive correlation between permeability and dominant porosity Modified from Peng et al 2019a Pore structure and wettability also have important impact on wateroil displacement and their influence is still difficult to be distinguished For example a laminated distribution of oil removal ratio is found for a Wolfcamp Shale sample which is related to the laminated distribution of mineralogy and the associated pore structure and organic matter distribution in the pores within different lamina Fig 2 Figure 2

mineralogy analysis d and e high-resolution SEM analysis on the pores in the oil imbibedremained areas Modified from Peng et al 2019b These previous work answered the questions of where the water goes in displacement of oil or gas and what are the influencing factors Further work is needed for questions on how far and how fast water can go in the matrix and the influencing factors Proposed Experiments Two sets of experiments are proposed with the goal to determine the optimal neutron radiography scanning settings and sample size The first set of experiments is water imbibition in dry air-saturated samples and the second is water imbibition in oil-saturated samples Heavy water will be used in the wateroil imbibition experiment In both experiments samples with different diameter will be used We plan to obtain plug samples with diameters of 14 26 52 80 104 and 254 mm Different pixel resolution ranging from 10 to 100 m will be tested In-situ neutron imaging will be conducted every 1-10 min with a time interval compatible with the specific pixel resolution X-ray radiography will be conducted simultaneously after the optimal neutron imaging setting and sample size being determined The whole feasibility study will require three days at NIST References DiStefano Victoria H Cheshire Michael C McFarlane Joanna Kolbus Lindsay M Hale Richard E Perfect Edmund Bilheux
