Scientific Background Rare-earth-free permanent magnets have recently become the focus of an intense worldwide research effort in materials physics  Currently the worldwide permanent magnet market is dominated by two classes of magnets i high-performance Nd-Fe-B with a maximum energy product  figure of merit BHmax  400 kJm-3 at 300 K and ii low-performance ferrite-based magnets with a BHmax  40 kJm-3  There is a strong need for a medium-performance and cost-effective material working at temperatures as high as 500 K  typical operating temperature of motors where the BHmax of Nd-Fe-B is unacceptably low Rare-earth-free Mn-based permanent magnets eg Mn-Bi and Mn-Al are a prime candidate for filling the gap between Nd-Fe-B and the ferrites  The low temperature phase of Mn-Bi is of particular interest here since it exhibits several interesting magnetic properties i high magnetocrystalline anisotropy K1  106 Jm3 and ii a very unusual positive temperature coefficient of the coercive field Hc ie Hc  K1 increases with increasing temperature see eg  and Fig 1 These outstanding characteristics make Mn-Bi a promising candidate for high-temperature magnet applications The central aim in Mn-based magnet research is to develop reliable and reproducible synthesis procedures and to understand the correlation between the microstructure and the macroscopic magnetic properties Hc Mr BHmax for instance the relation between the average crystallite size the grain shape or the effect of amount of metallic Mn and Bi residue at the grain boundary on Hc  Understanding of this microstructure-property relationship and of the related magnetization-reversal process nucleation versus pinning is of decisive importance for the development of high-performance Mn-based magnets Chen et al  have succeeded in synthesizing Mn-Bi bulk magnets with remarkable magnetic properties using conventional ball milling followed by magnetic separation and fast hot-compaction see figure Notably the BHmax values of Mn45Bi55 magnets lie above 40 kJm3 at 500 K which is more than twice that of Nd2Fe14B 158 kJm3 As pointed out by Chen et al for a detailed understanding of the coercivity mechanism of Mn-Bi magnets microscopic information on the magnetic microstructure is mandatory Previous results and aim of proposed work All the Mn-Bi studies that were conducted so far employ macroscopic integral measurement techniques such as vibrating sample magnetometry VSM in order to address this task This proposal and the PhD thesis of Artem Malyeyev deals with the investigation of the mesoscale spin structure of this material by means of SANS techniques USANS and SANS We have carried out a preliminary test measurement on a Mn45Bi55 alloy using the conventional instrument SANS-1 at MLZ Garching Germany However as can be seen in Fig 2 the available q-range in this test run about 005  q  2 nm-1 is not sufficient to access the scattering due to large-scale magnetic structures Therefore we intend to carry out unpolarized and magnetic-field-dependent USANS measurements at BT5 in order to access the micron-sized magnetization fluctuations This USANS beam time request is complementary to the unpolarized SANS request on the instrument NG7 Fig 1 Temperature-dependent properties of Mn45Bi55 bulk magnets  hot-compacted at 473 523 and 573 K see insets a maximum energy product BHmax at different temperatures b coercive field HcT Fig 2 2 averages of the total nuclear and magnetic SANS cross section of Mn45Bi55 obtained at SANS-1 MLZ Note the lack of a plateau at the low q indicating the presence of long-range magnetization fluctuations SANS data analysis will be done in terms of micromagnetic theory We have recently derived analytical expressions for the magnetic SANS cross section of bulk ferromagnets taking into account the isotropic exchange interaction the antisymmetric Dzyialoshinskii-Moriya-interaction the magnetic anisotropy and the magnetostatic interaction dipolar interaction plus Zeeman  This approach allows one to describe field-dependent SANS data in the near-saturation regime providing quantitative information on the exchange-stiffness constant as well as on the spatial structure and strength of the magnetic anisotropy field The magnetic SANS cross section will be obtained by subtracting the nuclear and magnetic scattering at saturation 9T from the data at lower fields In addition to the analysis in Fourier space we will compute the correlation function from the experimental magnetic SANS cross section and analyze the magnetic correlations in real space The field dependence of the correlation length provides important information on the size of defects in the microstructure The outcome of this experiment will contribute to our fundamental understanding of the spin structure of Mn-Bi and we will learn on the microstructure-property relationship and the nature of the magnetization-reversal mechanism by correlating microscopic and macroscopic properties Proposed experiments Magnetic-field-dependent unpolarized USANS k0  H0 will be carried out at 300 K on two Mn1-xBix samples of different composition x  045 and 055 as in  These specimens will also be studied using polarized SANS at NG7 Due to its large magnetic anisotropy Mn-Bi requires a large applied field  2T to approach the saturation regime which is a prerequisite of the data analysis in terms of micromagnetic theory We therefore request the 9T superconducting magnet The samples exist and are structurally TEM SEM EBSD XRD and magnetically VSM very well characterized see  Counting times of the order of 4h are estimated for one applied field Measuring two samples at typically 5-7 fields between 9T and Hc and for 00003 nm-1  q  01 nm-1 requires about 3 days at BT5 including experiment setup and all calibration measurements BT5 is necessary because of the possibility to reach qmin  00003 nm-1 we expect scattering from large domain structures and its compatibility with the 9T superconducting magnet for the perpendicular scattering geometry k0  H0  O Gutfleisch MA Willard E Brck CH Chen SG Sankar and
