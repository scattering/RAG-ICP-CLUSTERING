Nanoparticles NPs assembled at the wateroil interface reduce the interfacial tension The NPs form disordered liquid-like assemblies where the NPs are mobile in the plane of the interface The energy holding the NPs at the interface is of the order of several kBT kBT  4  1021 J at 300 K This low binding energy of the NPs leads to an exchange between the NPs at the interface and those dispersed in the medium Increasing the capillary energy that binds the particles to the interface such as by generating particles of inhomogeneous surface chemistry irreversibly anchors the NPs to the interface This permanent attachment of the NPs to the interface allows us to use the liquid-liquid interface to structure all-liquid systems into complex shapes and to use the functionality of the NPs and their assemblies to impart unique characteristics eg conductivity or plasmonic behavior Recently we uncovered a very unusual characteristic of the assembly of paramagnetic NPs MNPs at a fluid interface A droplet Fig 1 of an aqueous dispersion of Fe3O4-CO2H MNPs immersed in an immiscible liquid eg toluene is a paramagnetic ferrofluid After adding amine-modified polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane POSS-NH2 ligands to the surrounding oil phase the attractive electrostatic interactions between the ligands and MNPs result in the formation of MNP-surfactants MNPSs By changing the shape of the droplet with an external field the interfacial area increases and more MNPSs form and assemble at the interface between the oil and water Upon removal of the field the interfacial area decreases to minimize energy and the MNPSs jam at the interface locking in the shape Any reduction in the volume of the droplet as for example the dissolution of the water in the oil or evaporation of the water will also jam the MNPSs The remarkable finding that has emerged is that the jammed monolayer of MNPSs converts the FF droplet into a ferromagnetic liquid magnetic droplet Magnetic hysteresis loop Fig 1 black as measured by vibrating sample magnetometer VSM of an ferrofluid droplet where the MNPs have a saturation magnetization Ms that depends on the total number of MNPs a negligible coercive field Hc and zero remanent magnetization Mr The addition of POSS-NH2 to the toluene leads to a jamming of the MNPSs at the interface and the resultant magnetic hysteretic and ferromagnetic behavior Fig 1b red Both curves shown in Figure 1 are obtained with the same ferrofluid droplet prior to and after jamming While the total number of MNPs is the same same Ms an Mr 810-5 emu and Hc 90 Oe were found The dipole moment imparted to the ferrofluid droplet is retained by the magnetized monolayer of jammed MNPSs and remains until the droplet is re-magnetized with a field exceeding the switching field or the assembly is unjammed Perhaps a more startling finding are the hysteresis loops of single jammed aqueous droplets with 05 g L-1 of MNPs at pH 45 immersed in a 10 g L-1 solution of POSS-NH2 in toluene and hysteresis loops of the same system after being sonicated Fig 2 Remanent Mr and saturation magnetization Ms of the droplets change as a function of droplet volume The remanence ratio MrMs as a function of initial droplet volume Figure 1 Hysteresis loop of a ferrofluid a dispersion of paramagnetic NPs in a carrier fluid blck points shows no hysteresis while the same droplet with a monolayer of jammed particles at the oilcarrier fluid interface is converted into a ferromagnetic liquid droplet that shows hysteresis single droplet or droplet sonicated into multiple smaller droplets remains constant at 025 This suggests that every MNP contributes to remanent magnetization ie the magnetization of the jammed MNPs at the interface biases the magnetization of the MNPs that are dispersed in the droplet It is precisely this propagation of the magnetization from the MNPs jammed at the interface to the MNPs dispersed in the liquid that is of interest to the proposed polarized neutron reflectivity studies Here we are proposing to perform polarized neutron reflectivity studies on a large droplet of MNPs where the MNPs are jammed at the interface Experiments will be performed with a large ferromagnetic liquid droplet sandwiched between two single crystal silicon substrates where the separation distance between the confining wall will be varied Alternative a cuvette with two single crystal silicon sides will be partially filled with toluene coating the POSS surfactant and then the aqueous dispersion will be added to the cuvette Gravity will cause the droplet to sink to the base of the cell but a layer of the MNPSs will form between the aqueous phase and the walls of the cell This assembly of MNPSs can then be easily jammed affecting the same geometry as with the droplet compressed between the two silicon substrates A moment will be imparted to the droplet using a permanent magnet held in the next to the silicon substrate and removed during measurement The scattering vector dependence of the reflectivity measurements with the polarization direction parallel to and normal to the interface will be used to determine the distance over which the magnetization propagates into the dispersion By varying the separation distance between the two substrates from  1 mm to  10 mm will allow us to determine coupling effects between the bounding jammed MNPs layers The geometry of the experiment is shown in Figure 3 We have made a preliminary model to indicate the expected information we hope to extract from the measurements Starting with the Si wall through which the neutron beam impinges on the sample SLD  207 x10-4 nm2  the next layer has the SLD of pure toluene 0941 x10-4 nm2 The next layers the one of specific interest will depend on the dissipation of the moment from the jammed layer If the volume fraction of the jammed MNP at the interface is 08 the SLD nuclear is  5840 x10-4 nm2 Using the published magnetic moment for the MNPs SLDmagnetic is  0677 x10-4 nm2 The aqueous medium is almost pure water and we use an SLD  -0561 x10-4 nm2  Using a nominal interlayer roughness of 01 nm we get the SLD profile and reflectivity shown at the top of Figure 4 We can compare this to a model in which the monolayer of jammed MNP at the interface more continuously decays to the dispersed solution with a large 20nm roughness at the MNPaqueous solution Figure 3 Single large FLD between two Si substrates Beam will enter through the Si Figure 2 Hysteresis loops of FLDs with different volumes Single droplets are red
