only up to  2 kbar for BSACAT complexes A B - result from increased solvent exposure Blue shifts at higher pressures for BSACAT are presumably due to a burying of TRPs into a non-polar microenvironment within aggregated fibril states Proposed experiment and justification of beamtime As a non-destructive probe for pressure effects from minutes to hours a time scale prohibitive for in-situ SAXS techniques SANS is essential to characterize structural changes and hysteresis in BSApolyphenol complexes The poor contrast of the polyphenol is equally an advantage simplifying data fitting we are currently running MD simulations to obtain ensemble BSA models to fit the data at the various pressures Spectroscopic and scattering techniques combined with previous results on docking simulations on the formation of BSApolyphenol complexes  provide a holistic view and a rational for the use of pressure to tailor properties Given the efficacies of polyphenols in modulating the function of uptake transporter proteins and their possible influence in food-drug interactions  the study we propose is timely and will support future studies on interactions with other proteins EGCG and CAT are representative of polyphenols with and without a functional galloyl group respectively thought to anchor in a BSA hydrophilic pocket We now request for beamtime to investigate the in situ HP effects on the structure of BSACAT complexes to compare the correlation between binding modes and macroscopic changes HP-fluorescence data showed a blue shift at pressures above 2 kbar for BSACAT complexes that may be caused by the formation of BSA amyloid fibril aggregates but there is so far no structural data to directly support this We will screen HP effects at 20C and fixed pH up to 35 kbar RP 05 10 20 30 35 kbar and back to RP on the complexes of BSACAT The same HP screening will be carried for the buffer alone and its contribution subtracted from the scattering of the complex Total 2 samples 7 pressures each Our previous protein-only concentration screenings showed no structure factor effects at 40 mgml the BSA concentration we use for the BSApolyphenol complexes We have determined that 15h of exposure and equilibration at each pressure is sufficient Taking into account the HP-cell setup and background measurements as emptyreloading of the sample in the system we request 2 days of beamtime at one of the 30m SANS instruments q range 0001-03 -1 References  Saeki et al 2018 Molecules 23 1295  Galazka et al 1996 Food Chem 57 393-398  Li  Hagerman 2014 J Agr Food Chem 62 3768-3775  Tang et al 2017 J Agric Food Chem 65 656-665  Hussain S A Sulaiman A A Alhaddad H  Alhadidi Q 2016 J Inter Ethnopharmacology 51 97-104 1234RP372376380384388EndStartCOM nmPressure kbar COM Excitation  295 nmCOM BSA-EGCG Pressure Series 20C 1234RP340341342343EndCOM nmPressure kbar COMCOM BSA-Catechin 20 Pressure Series 20CStartFigure 2 Center of mass COM shift in fluorescence emission of BSA with pressure for A a complex with EGCG structure drawn with the galloyl highlighted in red and B with CAT structure drawn The complex stoichiometries are the same as those used for BSAEGCG and planned for BSACAT A B
