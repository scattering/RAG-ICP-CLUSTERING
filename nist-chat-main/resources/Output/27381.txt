 Page 1 of 3 Effect of amyloid- peptide segments on bending rigidity of lipid bicelles Background Intramembrane proteolysis is a biochemical process involved in diverse biological signaling events that are key to cell differentiation development and metabolism1 In a highly regulated fashion intramembrane proteases IPs cleave within a transmembrane helix of membrane-bound substrates to release cytoplasmic or extracellular proteinspeptides which in turn translocate to different regions of the cell where they elicit their corresponding biological response2 Despite their broad biomedical reach basic questions eg the structure of the active enzyme how hydrophobic substrates are lured into the hydrophilic active site and the role of membrane lipids in hydrolysis chemistry remain unanswered We have been working to answer these questions for the intramembrane aspartyl protease IAP enzyme class as exemplified by signal peptide peptidase SPP and presenilin IAP is representative of one of three IP classes that hydrolyze substrates within the hydrophobic lipid environment3 and is the least understood Eukaryotic SPP acts on remnant leader sequences found in nascent polypeptides to liberate shorter remnants from the membrane4 5 SPP shares sequence similarity with presenilin the catalytic component of the -secretase complex involved in the production of amyloid- peptides implicated in Alzheimer disease6 Presenilin and SPP share a membrane-embedded active site motif involving two aspartate residues can cleave the same substrates and be inhibited by the same active site-directed small molecules7 similarities extend to IAP orthologs throughout life8-10 However no attention has been paid to the role of membrane lipids in the chemistry of IAPs For ongoing structure-function studies in the field including drug discovery to modulate the activity of IAPs for therapeutic purposes such information would be highly valuable Given our prior biochemical results see below there is clearly a role for the lipid environment in tuning the chemistry of this fascinating and complex enzyme system Aim of the Proposed Experiment The aim of this proposal is to determine the effect of three amyloid- peptide segments on bicelle rigidity using neutron spin echo NSE spectroscopy Our bicelles synthetic bilayer lipid discs  300nm in diameter are composed of 12-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine DMPC and 3-3-cholamidopropyl dimethylammoni-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate CHAPSO11 We will test the hypothesis that the C-terminal region of amyloid- increases bicelle rigidity in line with an NMR study of amyloid- demonstrating a binding site for cholesterol12 In addition to providing a valuable comparison to these NMR results and results of other model lipid membranes in response to cholesterol13 the study will also serve as proof-of-principle for expanding NSE studies to more complex systems eg including the IAP Finally the study is complementary to our protein-centric SANS studies both in fully contrast-matched n-dodecyl--D-maltoside DDM micelles conducted previously at ORNL14 and in bicelles unpublished Previous experiments Enzymology Our previous biochemical study of a model IAP from M marisnigri JR1 purified to homogeneity and then reconstituted into bicelles demonstrated that the Km measure of affinity is tighter for a fluorescent 10-amino acid segment of amyloid- peptide C100 in bicelle-containing buffer compared to in n-dodecyl--D-maltoside DDM-only solution Fig 1a concomitant with a clear cleavage preference for Thr Fig 1b Fig 215 These result point to a role for the bicelles11 in IAP chemistry at both the so-called - and - cleavage sites of amyloid- Ihara model16 Figure 1 IAP catalysis A Activity of IAP

been validated in a number of previous studies primarily on single- and multi-component lipid membranes17 18 and more recently on cholesterol and peptide-containing membranes Ashkar Lab in preparation which indicate a remarkable dynamic interplay between peptides and their host membrane The findings from these experiments support our hypothesis of membrane-mediated effects on enzymatic activity and further motivate the investigation of the role of membrane bending in regulating enzyme function Proposed experiments 1 Peptide selection We will purchase three peptides GGVVIATVIV TVIVITLVML GGVIVITLVM unlabeled versions of those used in our prior enzymology study15 where we either used FRET pairs Fig 1 or fusion protein with maltose binding protein MBP and small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO Fig 2 Each peptide consists of 10 amino acids in partially overlapping register with the key presenilin - and - cleavage sites of amyloid- Fig 2a 2 Bicelle preparation and peptide reconstitution A 30 bicelle stock concentration is prepared as described11 or purchased from Anatrace The cold bicelle stock solution will be added to the peptide sample dissolved to 10 mM in DMSO and diluted in deuterated Hepes buffered saline and bicelles with or without DDM to obtain 100 M peptide concentration in 25 ww bicelle with or without 002 DDM The cold sample will be mixed gently and then incubated on ice for an hour to complete the reconstitution process Each sample will be prepared to a final volume of 3 ml which is adequate for 1mm path length NSE cells 3 NSE We propose to run bending rigidity measurements on a set of lipid membrane samples with no peptide only DMSO vehicle with and without DDM and analogous measurements with the individual peptides stated above NSE signals will be collected on lipid bicelles in D2O buffer over a q-range of 045-10 nm-1 The obtained intermediate structure factors will be fitted to a stretched exponential function with a stretching exponent of 23 typically used for lipid membranes to extract the decay rates of bicelle dynamics The bending rigidity  will be calculated from the q-dependent decay rates  using a modified Zilman-Granek19 with corrections by Watson and Brown20 such that   00069  5X55 5G55725B5X55 5G553 Each of these runs requires  12 hours of data collection for reasonable statistics With the sample list proposed above ie 3 peptide-bicelle complexes prepared in bicelles with and without DDM the most widely used detergent for the isolation and purification of proteins Measurements on analogous peptide-free bicelles will be used as a reference Put together this adds up to 8 samples Accounting for background and resolution measurements  1 day we request 5 days of NSE beam time 4 SANS For complementary structural characterization of the samples we request 12 day of SANS beam time   hr per sample for the full q-range including lens configuration preferably at the start of the allocated NSE beam time granted the
