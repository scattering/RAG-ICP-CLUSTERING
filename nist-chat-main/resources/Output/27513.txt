1 Dynamics in Equilibrated or Metastable Aqueous Electrolytes Chongyin Yang Howard Wang Madhusudan Tyagi Chunsheng Wang Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Maryland Non-aqueous electrolyte in state-of-the-art batteries give rise to severe safety and environmental concerns as they exhibit intrinsic drawbacks including flammability toxicity and high sensitivity toward moisture Aqueous batteries hold promise to address this issue but are often maligned because of their low energy densities due to the narrow electrochemical stability window of water 123 V Recently we addressed this challenge and made ground-breaking efforts by expanding the ESW of water to 3 - 4 V when first introducing the concept of the water-in-salt electrolyte class WiSE based on highly or superconcentrated lithium salts Thanks to this electrolyte a brand new halogen conversion-intercalation cathode chemistry coupling with a passivated graphite anode blazed a trail for high-energy 400 Whkg material level aqueous batteries Extremely high solubility molality 20 molkg of LiTFSI in water is ensured by their hydrate-melting behavior which indicates the strong disturbing of salt ion-pairing and water hydrogen-bonding in solution structure Since water molecules are all retained in Li solvation shell their significantly reduced activity not only eliminates water compositions in batteries but also potentially suppresses the freezing point of electrolyte leading excellent low-temperature performances of electrolyte However LiTFSI-H2O system possesses too much Li cation - TFSI anion ion pairing causing facile salt recrystallization and thus slash low-temperature conductivity Recently we discovered another WiSE system - LiClZnCl2 mixture solution LZC which has even more disturbed ionswater association Due to the preferred associations of water to Li and Cl- to Zn2 hydrated Li and ZnCl42- large anion network dominates the solvation structure causing unprecedently suppressed water activity and cation-anion ion pairing As a result this electrolyte system provides excellent at a wide operation temperature window of -80 oC to 80 oC In order to investigate the transport behavior of LZC system we have carried out preliminary measurements on the dynamics by using neutron scattering Figure 1 shows the mean square displacements of LZC  9H2O solution while cooling from the room temperature to 4 K white and subsequently heating back green as measured using neutron backscattering Data show that prominent water motion has persisted to temperatures as low as  170 K which is an important finding for potential applications as aqueous electrolyte in low temperature operations No hysteresis exists in LZC solution as normal aqueous solutions such as LiCl solution as data show thawing occurs at  250K meaning absolutely no crystallization or phase transition happens as low as 170K We also did H diffusivity and relax time of LZC sample calculated from quasi-elastic neutron scattering results at dynamic transition temperature window Fig 2 However these data just reflect relatively slower motion dynamic of H Several fundamental issues arise from the preliminary measurements 1 What is the nature of the fast water dynamics therefore Li motion in aqueous electrolytes which relates more with the real performance in batteries 3 How is the solution structure related to these unique performances We propose to carry out experiments to investigate the LZC water-in-salt system by with dynamics measurements by neutron backscattering and disk chopper spectroscopy DCS Specifically we will prepare 5 compositions of LZC with different water contents The phase behavior of the binary mixtures will be measured over the temperature range of 170 K to 300 K The dynamic of water and cation may vary as the local packing of the anion-containing solvation sheath varies with the composition and temperature The dynamics structure 2 factors and the ion mobility of the electrolytes will be quantified  Samples Aqueous solutions of LZC with water molar ratio of 11 10 9 8 7 will be prepared  Measurements The structure of mixtures in homogenous and separated phases will be studied using 30m SANS first and their dynamics features assessed using fixed window elastic back scattering scan over temperature ranges of 4 - 300 K Based on the gathered structure and dynamics information quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS measurements will be carried out on selected samples at temperatures of interest using both BS and DCS SANS will be measured at temperatures 260 K 270 K 290 K 310K and 330 K for all samples while QENS measurements will be carried out at 4 K 230 K 250K 273K and 293 K respectively Two neutron wavelengths of 8  and 4  with corresponding resolutions of 30 eV and 200 eV will be used to cover as many relaxations as possible with counting time of 5 hours at 8  and 2 hours at 4  respectively due to lower neutron flux at larger wavelength More accurate temperature choices for QENS will be determined from the FWS in HFBS for individual samples With SANS we expect to observe fluctuations in metastable states and the nascent phase separated structures when mixtures are brought to unstable states The temperature and composition dependence of the stability of metastable structures will be assessed Corresponding dynamics measurement will reveal the mobility of ions and cast insights in possible schemes of harvesting metastable states of aqueous electrolytes for practical low temperature applications Beam Time Request We will prepare a total of 10 samples for this study Combining variations of the sample composition and the temperature we request 2 days of beam time on 30 m SANS for the structure characterization and 9 days on HFBS and 5 days on DCS for the dynamic measurements References 1 Suo L et al Water-in-salt electrolyte enables high-voltage aqueous lithium-ion chemistries Science 2015 3506263 p 938-943 2 Yang C et al Aqueous Li-ion battery enabled by halogen conversion-intercalation chemistry in graphite Nature 2019 5697755 p 245-250 3 Figures and Figure Caption Figure 1 Mean square displacements of LZC LiCl and ZnCl2 aqueous solutions while cooling from the room temperature to 4 K at 1Kmin and heating back as measured by neutron back scattering Figure 2 H diffusivity and relax time of LZC sample calculated from quasi-elastic neutron scattering at dynamic transition temperature window
