Power neutron diffraction on deuteration diisopropylammonium halides DIPA-X Background Ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials play an important role in many applications due to how both the innate electric polarization and crystal structure respond to an applied electric field Most conventional ferroelectrics currently in use are oxide ceramics While these materials such as PbTi1-xZrxO3 PZT and BaTiO3 have the benefits of high Curie temperatures and large spontaneous polarizations they can be relatively expensive stiff and concerning the widely used PZT there is often a drive to move to lead-free ferroelectrics A potentially impactful alternative is the development of organic ferroelectric systems which can be cheaper safer and can be made into flexible thin films which would be ideal for inclusion in flexible electronics DIPA-X halides Fig 1 with X  Cl Br I are organic molecular ferroelectrics with large spontaneous polarization at room temperature and Curie temperatures of 100 C or higher1 2 Like many inorganic ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 the DIPA-X system can be classified as an ionic displacement ferroelectric A key feature of the systems structure is the hydrogen bonds between the ammonium and halogen According to first-principles Berry-phase calculations the hydrogen bonds play a key role in the formation of the underlying Wannier dipole moments that underlie the spontaneous polarization3 This suggests that replacement of these hydrogens with deuterium should affect ferroelectric properties notably the spontaneous polarization and the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric Curie transition temperature A complete understanding of the hydrogen or deuterium structure in DIPA-X will not only help clarify the mechanisms behind ferroelectricity in this system but also help identify ways to engineer or exploit those mechanisms to optimize the function properties of DIPA-X Figure 1 Crystal structure of ferroelectric DIPA-Br at room temperature showing the Wannier dipoles associated with the hydrogen bonds linking N and Br The spontaneous polarization arises from a coherent canting of these dipoles toward the 01 direction3 Aim We found that deuteration of the amine hydrogens in DIPA-X is easily carried out by recrystallization from heavy water suggesting that this is an effective way to deuterate the hydrogens that participate in hydrogen bonded chains in the system4 Our preliminary measurements demonstrate that deuterium does have a marked effect on the ferroelectric properties of DIPA-X Figure 2 shows the results of differential scanning calorimetry measurements with regular and deuterated DIPA-X with X  Cl Br I Deuteration lower the Curie temperature by up to 29 C This result was repeated with the Chloride and Iodide as summarized in Table 1 However x-ray diffraction measurements on the deuterated DIPA-X compounds show little difference in structure from the non-deuterated samples indicating that neutron diffraction is necessary to understand the hydrogen bonds in the system These results are in stark contrast to what happens in traditional hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics like potassium dihydrogendideuteron phosphate These are order-disorder systems where the spontaneous polarization arises directly from hydrogen-bond ordering This ordering is associated with an optical phonon mode that softens and freezes at the transition temperature Deuteration increases the optical mode frequencies by a factor of sqrt2 increasing the transition temperature by the same ratio - from 147 K to 230 K in the case of potassium dihydrogendideuteron phosphate6 With DIPA-X the effect is opposite - a decrease in the transition temperature and a small decrease at that Using locally available tools the role of hydrogen and deuterium in this system is difficult to investigate especially structurally as x-rays are essentially insensitive As hydrogen will lead to a large amount of incoherent scattering we aim to use neutron diffraction to study the overall structure of deuterated DIPA-X above and below the ferroelectric transition This will allow us to better determine the positions of hydrogendeuterium in the DIPA-X structure and understand the mechanisms behind the deuterium-driven changes in the ferroelectric properties of the system Figure 2 Differential Scanning Calorimetry of composite samples composed of 50 DIPA-X peaks B and 50  d-DIPA-X peaks A along with pure indium peaks C included for calibration purposes The heat flow is endothermic recorded on heating from room temperature Chloride Bromide Iodide Transition Temperature 167 C 151 C 103 C Shift due to Deuteration -05 C -13 C -29 C Table 1 Ferroelectric-paraelectric transition temperatures for the three DIPA-halides and the corresponding shift due to deuteration Data from Fig 2 Proposed Experiment We propose to perform power neutron diffraction on three deuterated DIPA-X samples with X  Cl Br I in order to collect high-resolution data sets We are able to synthesis 10s of grams of each sample which should be more than sufficient for these measurements and would like to measure each sample at two temperatures on the instrument BT-1 at room temperature and then above the Curie temperature for each sample This would require a sample environment capable of heating up to 200 C We will not need to measure temperatures much higher than TC as we will need to remain below the decompositionmelting temperature for the samples We anticipate the each of the six scans will take a maximum of 6 hours each As the time for sample preparation and heating is relatively minimal we request 2 days for this experiment Preliminary Results In addition to the scanning calorimetry work detailed above we have performed sample synthesis and deuteration and x-ray powder diffraction The DIPA-X and d-DIPA-X compounds were synthesized in from stoichiometrically proportioned diisopropylamine with hydrogen bromide in water or with deuterium bromide in heavy water dried and recrystallized from methanol Combined proton and deuteron confirmed that the d-DIPA-X compounds were fully and exclusively deuterated on the nitrogen site We have made an abundance of DIPA-X powder deuterated on the nitrogen site and will be able to supply as much as necessary 5 - 15 g for neutron powder diffraction Full deuteration will be accomplished by direct synthesis of diisopropylamide from deuterated feed stocks followed by synthesis of the salt from deuterium bromide X-ray power diffraction has been performed on both deuterated and undeuterated DIPA-X and the values obtained from the fits will be used to inform the neutron data analysis The crystal structure of DIPA-X is monoclinic P21 in the ferroelectric phase and P21m in the paraelectric phase with the larger halogens resulting larger lattice spacings27 As stated above deuteration has little-to-no effect on the x-ray diffraction results Since x-rays are effectively insensitive to the hydrogendeuterium this demonstrates that neutron diffraction will be beneficial in qualifying the role of hydrogen bonding in this organic ferroelectric system References 1 D W Fu H L Cai Y M Liu Q Ye W Zhang Y Zhang X Y Chen G Giovannetti M Capone J Y Li and R G Xiong Diisopropylammonium Bromide Is a High-Temperature Molecular Ferroelectric Crystal Science 339 6118 425-428 2013 2 D W Fu W Zhang H L Cai J Z Ge Y Zhang and R G Xiong Diisopropylammonium chloride a ferroelectric organic salt with a high phase transition temperature and practical utilization level of spontaneous polarization Advanced materials 23 47 5658-5662 2011 3 L Louis K Pitlke S Poddar S Ducharme and S Nakhmanson Polarization canting in ferroelectric diisopropylammonium-halide molecular crystals a computational first principles study submitted to the Journal of Materials Chemistry C 2017 4 L Jauregui Study of The Organic Ferroelectric Diisopropylammonium Halide Masters Thesis University of Nebraska 2019 5 L Jaureguei R Kuchta W Waters and S Ducharme Effect of Deuteration on the Ferroelectric-to-Paraelectric Phase Transition in diisopropylammonium Halides in preparation 2019 6 C C Stephenson J M Corbella and L A Russell Transition Temperatures in some Dihydrogen and Dideutero Phosphates and Arsenates and their Solid Solutions The Journal of chemical physics 21 6 1110-1110 1953 7 S Poddar H Lu J Song B Sukup B Noll S Vallopally A Gruverman and S Ducharme Crystal structure and ferroelectric properties of diisopropylammonium iodide in preparation 2017
