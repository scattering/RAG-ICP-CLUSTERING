From single to multiple-q magnetic structures in centrosymmetric oxides Lucas Barreto1 William Ratcliff2 Alexander Grutter2 and Steven May1 1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering Drexel University 2 NIST Center for Neutron Research NIST Introduction Spin textures beyond collinear arrangements present several potential applications in data storage logical devices and spintronics Furthermore they are a rich playground to investigate fundamental physical phenomena such as competing exchange interactions coupling between electronic transport and spin structures and new routes to multiferroicity  Skyrmion lattices SKLs non-trivial multi-q spin configurations are considerably interesting due to their topology which guarantees their magnetic configuration stability In non-centrosymmetric systems the appearance of SKLs is mainly due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions  In the presence of inversion symmetry it is also possible to stabilize SKLs but in this case it is a consequence of different competing interactions Therefore the investigation of multi-q spin textures in centrosymmetric systems can provide alternative strategies to stabilize SKLs and can deepen our physical understanding of how complex magnetic structures emerge Recently it has been proposed that the cubic perovskite SrFeO3 exhibits a multi-q spin texture  In this proposal we will determine the magnetic structure of centrosymmetric SrFeO3 and CaFeO3 films via neutron diffraction to better understand the origin of the SKL state in SrFeO3 By comparing these materials we aim to elucidate how carrier itineracy plays a role in stabilizing the spin texture as SrFeO3 is a metal and CaFeO3 is an insulator A proper mapping and understanding of ordered magnetic states in these compounds may elucidate mechanisms to control and switch between different spin configurations Background and Preliminary work Over the last decade the magnetism community has turned considerable attention to the study of non-collinear spin textures such as spin cycloids and skyrmions The alkaline earth ferrites - SrFeO3 and CaFeO3 - are an interesting material system to explore such spin configurations Both materials have been shown to exhibit incommensurate helical magnetic ordering described by the wavevector q  013 013 013 q  0357 -1 for SrFeO3 and 016 016 016 q  0458 -1 for CaFeO3 where the propagation vector is defined relative to the pseudocubic perovskite lattice4 However based on neutron diffraction measurements Ishiwata and coauthors have recently Figure 1 a X-ray diffraction measured from epitaxial SrFeO3 top and CaFeO3 bottom films grown on LSAT substrates The extracted c-axis parameters are consistent with fully oxidized and strained films while the peak width is finite thickness limited attesting to the film quality Resonant x-ray diffraction from b CaFeO3 and c SrFeO3 films measured at the Fe L23-edge These measurements confirm the presence of helical magnetism in the films but do not enable direct distinction between single- and multi-q structures asserted that SrFeO3 hosts a multi-q spin texture analogous to a SKL despite it being a cubic perovskite and thus lacking a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction They find a double-q structure below 80 K and a quadruple-q structure between 80 - 120 K where these four different vectors belong to the family of possible 111 directions Building on this result our group performed resonant x-ray diffraction from epitaxial SrFeO3 and CaFeO3 thin films Fig  We were able to measure the fundamental magnetic wavevector confirming the helical order we also observed differences in the evolution of the peak shape as a function of temperature that are consistent with a multi-q structure in SrFeO3 and a single-q helix in CaFeO3 However these measurements were performed at only one q-vector and thus do not allow us to directly confirm the single or multi-q nature of these films Therefore neutron diffraction measurements carried out at multiple q vectors are needed to better understand the spin structures in these materials Proposed Experiments We aim to carry out systematic neutron diffraction measurements of a SrFeO3 and CaFeO3 film to determine if the films host single- or multi-q spin textures in their ground state We propose to carry out diffraction experiments using the BT7 instrument which is well-suited for thin film diffraction as the inelastic contributions from the substrate can be removed to improve signal to noise The films to be measured are 40 nm thick on 1x1 cm2 LSAT substrates previous neutron diffraction experiments on films with similar volume have been used to measure antiferromagnetic and helical spin configurations Our research team has extensive experience with using neutron diffraction to determine spin structures in films7-1 Additionally the ferrites have a large moment 4 BFe that will also ensure a measurable signal We also note that the incommensurate nature of the magnetic peak is such that it will be far from any substrate reflections which would otherwise overlap or contribute to the background We therefore expect significantly improved signal to noise relative to typical thin film neutron diffraction experiments To further reduce the possibility of signal contamination from 2 or 3 reflections the beam will be filtered with three PG filters for a factor of at least 104 reduction in these wavelength contributions In the proposed experiments the samples will be zero-field cooled to base temperature 5 K Diffraction data will be collected in the absence of a field at the four relevant q vectors - for example these are 013 013 013 -013 013 013 013 -013 013 and 013 013 -013 in the SrFeO3 sample using a four-circle CCR sample environment The samples will then be heated to 150 K above the magnetic ordering temperatures and zero-field cooled to 90 K and the measurements repeated in order to determine if the proposed double-q to quadruple-q transition is present in the samples Following these experiments the samples will then be remounted to enable field-cooled measurements A magnetic field of 5 T will be applied along a 11 direction during cooling and then zero-field measurements at two q-vectors including along the same direction to which the field was applied will be performed Scans at these two q-vectors will be performed at 5 and 90 K To facilitate these field-dependent measurements the samples will be mounted on a wedge to allow for the field to be applied along a 11 direction Past experience with films in this thickness and cross-sectional area range indicates that counting times of approximately 5 minutes a point will be sufficient to resolve the peaks of interest so that we anticipate that each scan will take 5 hours to cover the necessary Q-range Thus each sample will take 3 days to measure at the 14 conditions We therefore request 6 days of beamtime The results of the neutron diffraction experiments will be compared with temperature- and angular-dependent magnetoresistance measurements carried out at Drexel to obtain a detailed understanding the spin textures in these ferrites and how the magnetic structures impact magnetotransport References  A Fert et al Nat Rev Mater 2 17031 2017  N Nagaosa et al Nat Nanotech 8 899 2013  S Ishiwata et al arXiv180602309 2018  T Takeda et al J Phys Soc Jpn 33 967 1972  P M Woodward et al Phys Rev B 62 844 2000  P C Rogge et al Phys Rev Mater 3 084404 2019  S J May et al Nat Mater 8 892 2009  A Huon et al Phys Rev B 98 224419 2018  A J Grutter et al Phys Rev Mater 2 094402 2018 1 A J Grutter et al Nano Lett 16 5647 2016 1 Q L He et al Nat Mater 16 94 2017 1 W Ratcliff et al Adv Funct Mater 21 1567 2011 1 T R Gao et al Nano Lett 17 2825 2017
