Polarized neutron reflectometry of rare earth iron garnetheavy-metal thin film heterostructures Caroline Ross Ethan Rosenberg Jackson Bauer Patrick Quarterman Alexander Grutter Brian Kirby and Julie Borchers 1 Introduction This proposal addresses key issues in the spin physics of rare earth iron garnets REIGs RE3Fe5O12 Ferromagnetic insulators FMIs convey spin currents without charge currents and exhibit low damping and high temperature functionality One of the most prominent classes of FMI is that of iron garnets notably YIG Material properties are designed by substituting RE such as Tm Eu or Tb into the garnet structure to alter the magnetocrystalline anisotropy magnetoelastic coefficients lattice strain damping compensation temperature and net magnetization via dilution of the Fe sublattices Ross et al have synthesized highly-textured REIG materials TmIG DyIG TbIG and EuIG that can be grown with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy on gadolinium galium garnet GGG and other substrates due to their high magnetostriction Our work to date has shown that the anisotropy and other magnetic properties can be engineered using magnetoelastic strain and composition 1- making them extremely interesting for spintronic applications Our films are made by pulsed laser deposition with thicknesses of 25 nm and above In the ideal structure all Fe and RE ions have a 3 valence state the Fe is present on two different sites octahedral and tetrahedral coupled antiferromagnetically while the RE on dodecahedral sites couples magnetically to the octahedral Fe The materials are therefore ferrimagnets and can display non-collinear structures depending on the temperature In some REIG such as TbIG for example there is a compensation temperature Tcomp at which the net magnetization is zero we find experimentally that Tcomp for our TbIG thin films is higher than that of bulk 250 K and this is expected to be related to the stoichiometry valence states and site occupancy of the ions The REFe ratio in the PLD films generally differs from the bulk value of 35 we found that this can be controlled by the oxygen pressure during deposition which can have profound implications on their magnetic properties Specifically the presence of charge and anti-site defects can affect magnetostriction sublattice magnetization and damping Our XPS measurements from thin films show that the RE can adopt other valence states and there may be compensating effects on the Fe  When combined into heterostructures with heavy metals or topological materials we have also determined that iron garnets display unexpected magnetic properties which are ideal for spin pumping or for spin-orbit torque devices For example in a recent investigation we found that spin transport across interfaces with heavy metals eg Pt enables spin orbit torque-driven domain wall motion at velocities of up to 15 kms in zero applied field as the result of Dyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction DMI at the substrate interface  Spin Hall magnetoresistance measurements across the compensation temperature indicate that the spin transport is governed by interaction between the heavy metal and the majority Fe sublattice Critically there is an intense ongoing debate about whether the anomalous Hall effect observed in heavy metalgarnet interfaces is due to a magnetic proximity effect or is fully a spin Hall magnetoresistance In this case direct and unambiguous determination of the magnetic and chemical depth profile is essential to resolving the debate Chemical intermixing is limited to approximately one unit cell 1 nm based on measurements of magnetization vs REIG thickness enabling electronic effects to be clearly identified Control of the emergent magnetic ground state and anisotropy in these materials will undoubtedly be the key for high efficiency generation of pure spin currents and spin-orbit switching As such our proposed neutron experiments aim to probe the complex interfacial magnetization in PtREIG bilayers 2 Neutron experiment This proposal is a continuation of a recent beamtime submission 26453 in which we carried out room temperature measurements on DyIGGGG and DyIGSi to demonstrate feasibility Note that we also have beamtime for a complementary PBR proposal on the characterization of the magnetization in garnet multilayers with varying anisotropy submission 26351 Bulk iron garnets were extensively studied in bulk in the 1960s and 1970s by neutron techniques such as high angle diffraction but neutron characterization of thin films is much more limited and is mainly focused on YIG-based systems For garnet heterostructures and garnetheavy metal heterostructures polarized neutron reflectometry PNR provides an ideal probe of the structural and magnetic depth profile The aim of this proposal thus encompasses measurement of RE garnetheavy metal heterostructures including proximity-induced magnetism through the compensation point of the garnet In this experiment proximity effects in REIGPt will be examined using a garnet with in-plane easy axis and a convenient compensation temperature DyIGGGG satisfies these criteria for both 100 and 111 orientations Film thicknesses of 20 nm for the DyIG and 10 nm for the Pt are well suited for the experiment Such work was attempted in the past  with TmIGPt but the film was too hard to saturate in plane which precluded measurement through Tcomp The in-plane component of the magnetization vs depth will be characterized using PNR to understand the DyIGPt interface In addition the nuclear depth profile will provide insight into any intermixing between the REIG and substrate which has previously been observed to be significant at GGGYIG interfaces with PNR In Figure 1 we present the spin asymmetry for the data collected previously at 15 and 200 K for DyIGPt grown on 100 GGG Our previous PNR simulations suggest that the presence of the proximity effect will change the sign or existence of a zero-crossing in the spin-splitting in several key region below 10 nm-1 so that we may readily expect to detect the phenomena of interest Fig 2 shows preliminary data obtained under proposal 26453 for DyIG films  For 35-40 nm thick films the XRD shows excellent film quality and the VSM gives a magnetization 50 kAm and anisotropy easy axis depending on the strain state in plane easy axis for GGG substrate where the film is in compression out of plane for two other garnet substrates where the film is in tension The PNR of a thicker film 120 nm shows that magnetization matches the value from VSM and there is a region 10 nm wide at the substrate interface where the magnetization changes gradually attributed to substrate roughness andor interdiffusion We also collected data on a PtDyIGGGG sample at 200 K which is currently being analysed but we did not have enough time to collect data at several temperatures as required In this proposal most data will be collected on a sample of 111 Pt 10DyIG 20nmGGG at temperatures of 180 210 230 250K to bracket Tcomp  220 K as well as at a lower temperature where the proximity effect is known to be stronger in PtYIG We would also measure a similar 111-oriented sample for comparison at one temperature and a sample with BiYIG instead of DyIG to examine the role of the rare earth also at one temperature The non-spin flip PNR measurements will be collected on PBR using the 07 T electromagnet to saturate the samples Measurements of each sample are expected to take 24 hrs for BiYIG and 100 DyIG to 48 hours for 111 DyIG on samples with a lateral area of 1 x 1 cm2 And so for the three samples we request a total of 6 days of beam time Figure 1 - Spin asymmetry measured for DyIGPt grown on 100 GGG at 15 K blue and 200 K yellow Figure 2 -
