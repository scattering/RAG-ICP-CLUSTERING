 Detecting Lithium Plating from Extreme Fast Charging in Lithium-Ion Batteries using Simultaneous Neutron and X-ray Imaging 1 Introduction One of the major bottlenecks in the widespread deployment of electric vehicles is the recharging time of commercial lithium-ion batteries LIBs A proposed solution is the extreme fast charging XFC of LIBs having charging times under 10-15 minutes However XFC results in severe degradation in the electrochemical performance of batteries which is mainly attributed to the loss of active Li either as dead Li which has become electronically disconnected after plating on the anode or inactive Li due to the irreversible reaction of Li with the electrolyte to form a solid electrolyte interphase SEI Since parasitic lithium plating is one of the identified major causes for XFC of LIBs1 understanding the origin and characteristics of Li plating during XFC in LIBs is very important as this can inform on methods to enable XFC Several studies have characterized Li plating during XFC using a variety of techniques such as cryo-EM X-ray diffraction and X-ray -CT Even though these techniques are valuable they do not provide a complete picture2 Therefore better understanding of the factors giving rise to Li plating from XFC in LIBs require a non-destructive technique with sufficient imaging resolution and image contrast to differentiate between low Z-elements Neutrons and X-rays-based dual mode tomography NeXT is an alternative non-destructive technique for investigating the characteristics of Li plating from XFC in LIBs It is advantageous in its ability to readily separate the different sample components such as lithium graphite and pores due to the complementary interaction of the two imaging probes with matter3 Neutron-based imaging is particularly advantageous for many lower Z elements such as carbon and lithium that are challenging to image using only X-rays due to the higher neutron cross-section These micron resolution morphological characterizations at the cell scale will then be combined with higher-resolution X-ray absorption-based -CT data obtained from synchrotron and lab-based tools eg Zeiss 520 Versa for complementary morphological information at finer length scales The spatial resolution achieved by NeXT is 15 m thus providing sufficient resolution to pinpoint the location of Li plating within the thickness of the anode - typically 80 m thick 2 Experimental Plan We performed NeXT experiments at the BT-2 beamline at National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research NCNR in September 2019 The main samples characterized at BT-2 were the pristine and cycled graphite anode strips containing plated lithium at different regions For these experiments we disassembled the battery pouch cells and used the graphite anode cycled under XFC conditions for 450 cycles at fully discharged condition The graphite electrode containing regions of low and high concentration of plated lithium was cut into strips at 1 2 and 3 positions given by Figure 1 a and then sealed in a glass capillary tube under Argon gas as seen in Figure 1 b Figure 1 a Graphite anode cycled at 9 C-rate for 450 cycles containing plated lithium b Graphite anode strip sealed in a glass capillary under argon environment c Kapton tube housing the sealed glass capillary We are using image processing algorithms developed by the BT-2 beamline scientists for processing the collected datasets to segment the lithium from graphite and pores Our preliminary results as given by the Figure 2 show promise Additionally we collected NeXT data on an uncycled single-layer battery pouch cell containing electrolyte The battery cell was rolled in the form of a cylinder and then put in the beam path We plan to complete the data analysis before the next allocated time at BT-2 to assess the quality of neutron tomography data on an unmodified pouch cell If scattering from the electrolyte or polymer separator hinders the quality of the neutron tomography we will explore using alternative separator material andor deuterated electrolyte Figure 2 a 3D reconstruction of the dual tomography data after it has been registered for both the neutrons and X-rays Here brown  10 m copper pink  80 m graphite with plated lithium Further analysis is ongoing to separate the graphite

single-layer battery pouch cell For the proposed experiments here we aim to seek answers to specific research questions such as 1 What is the effect of cycling rate on the extentheterogeneity of plating and capacity fade of the cell 2 Can we detect spatial heterogeneity of plated lithium as a function of the porosity and tortuosity of the electrode We expect that the NeXT tomography will reveal a full-scale 3D picture of the cell and morphology of the electrodes and Li concentration which will be instrumental in understanding the origin of the heterogeneity in cells that are cycled under the same a b c a c Plated lithium on the cycled graphite anode Glass capillary Graphite  Lithium Copper b conditions We aim to develop a relationship between the amount of plated lithium and the microstructure of graphite to propose a mechanism of lithium plating under extreme fast charging conditions in commercial LIBs For the experimental plan we will conduct NeXT imaging on single-layer battery pouch cells cycled at 4C 15 minute charge and 6C 10 minute charge then discharged slowly at C2 2 hours discharge to find the effect of cycling rate on the extentheterogeneity of lithium plating and the associated capacity fade of the cell Based on the preliminary results cyclic charging at 4 C-rate has shown negligible capacity fade while a 6 C-rate has shown significant fade in capacity up to 20 loss of capacity over 450 cycles Therefore to understand lithium plating cells will be charged at 4C and 6C at 450 cycles The nature of plating heterogeneity will be studied using NeXT at 0 and 100 state-of-charge which will enable us to detect dead and inactive Li The battery pouch cells will consist of a positive anode consisting of 80 m graphite on 10 m copper and a negative electrode consisting of a 90 m LiNiMnCo on 20 m aluminium The two electrodes will be separated by the electrolyte in a polymer separator Due to the large difference in the neutron cross-section of Li and C 71 and 00035 respectively the neutron tomography will be sensitive to the plated lithium through the depth of the anode 3 Time Request Based on our past experience we expect  15-20 hours for each tomography scan Thus we request two days for imaging 4C and 6C pouch cells at 0 SOC followed by two more days for imaging the same cells at 100 SOC Charging will be performed while the other cell is imaged Additionally we request one day for optimizing the set-up geometry and cell chemistry for neutron imaging and as buffer time Thus we request a total of five days during the next cycle for the lithium detection experiments at BT-2 at NCNR 4 Team Our team is based at SLAC and Stanford University We have extensive expertise in synchrotron- and lab-based X-ray tomography We are active
