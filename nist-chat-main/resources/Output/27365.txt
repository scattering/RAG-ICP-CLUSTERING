Establishing a stratum corneum lipids membrane model for investigating the influence of surfactants on the structure of the skin barrier lipids 1 Introduction The stratum corneum SC the outermost layer of the skin acts as the physical barrier to penetration of external compounds and retains the loss of water from the body 1 Referring to the bricks and mortar model the SC comprises 12 to 16 layers of corneocytes that linked together by corneodesmosomes and embedded in the intercellular lipid matrix constituting about a 10-15 m thick cells layer The corneocytes are flat hexagonal or pentagon-shaped dead cells with a mean thickness and a mean surface area of approximately 1 m and 1000 m2 respectively 2 3 They are filled with keratin filaments bound to water and natural moisturizing factors and enclosed within crosslinked structural proteins eg loricrin and involucrin called the cornified envelop CE which covalently linked to ceramides on the exterior surface providing hydrophobic interface between the CE and the intercellular lipid lamellae 4 The human SC lipids mainly contains ceramides free fatty acids and cholesterol in an approximately 111 molar ratio which highly organized to serve as the most important tortuous pathway for penetration of substances In the human SC lipid composition detail 14 different ceramide subclasses have been identified which varied in their sphingoid base and in fatty acid tail length The free fatty acids present are saturated and have chain length from C14 to C34 5 Previously small angle X-ray diffraction studies of human SC have shown that the lipids are arranged in two co-existing lamellar phasesshort periodicity phase SPP bilayer and long periodicity phase LPP trilayer with repeat distances of 6 and 13 nm respectively 67 Electron diffraction 89 and wide angle X-ray diffraction studies 10 have revealed that the SC lipids are ordered in mainly orthorhombic and in less ordered hexagonal packing with the decrease in depth of SC Moreover the relationship between lipid composition and lipid organization is that ceramides and cholesterol are the key to the formation of the SPP and LPP while long chain and short chain free fatty acids induce the formation of orthorhombic and hexagonal lateral packing respectively 11 as shown in Figure 1 Skin cleansers are designed to remove sebum and sweat as well as exogenous contaminants achieved by the aid of surfactants However in vitro ex vivo and in vivo studies have revealed that surfactants can interact with SC proteins and lipids during cleansing causing skin irritation and dryness Generally surfactants can bind to SC corneocytes resulting in transient swelling and hyper-hydration under Figure 1 A schematic drawing of the lamellar phases and lateral packing of intercellular lipids in human stratum corneum Bouwstra Joke A and Gert S Gooris2010 cleansing condition followed by de-swelling during water evaporation The degree of the corneocytes swelling depends on the charge density of surfactants anionic  amphoteric  non-ionic surfactants The more swelling corneocytes during cleansing are the lower hydration of skin after wash is Moreover the swelling can facilitate the penetration and intercalation of surfactants into SC lipid bilayers It has been suggested that surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration CMC can solubilize SC lipids in surfactant micelles causing the lipid removal 12 13 from the SC followed by the continual disrupt of skin barrier as showed in Figure 2 In order to be able to design mild cleansers that benefit the skin an in-depth understanding of the interaction mechanism between surfactants and skin needs to be fully revealed In the phase one of this study we aim to establish stratum corneum lipid tethered lipid membrane models using synthetic lipids to investigate the interaction mechanisms of surfactants with the skin barrier lipids surface The use of a tethered lipid membrane in conjunction with neutron reflectometry over stacked membranes used for neutron diffraction will allow us to add surfactants through the solvent phase after characterizing the as-prepared membrane We believe that such a membrane system would be a better model to study a subset of the surfactant - skin interactions than the previously used stacked membranes which are not solvent-immersed and cannot be manipulated after preparation 2 Experimental We will prepare one synthetic tethered lipid membrane system containing ceramides CER cholesterol CHOL and free fatty acids FA in a molar ratio of 111 using established procedures 14 Two subclasses of ceramides will be used in our studies 1 N-omega-linoleyloxyacyl sphingosine abbreviation CER EOS with an acyl chain of 30 carbon atoms and a sphingosine of 18 carbons 2 non-hydroxy fatty acid C24 with sphingosine abbreviation CER NS Additionally two free fatty acids will be used stearic acid C180 abbreviation FA16 and lignoceric acid C240 abbreviation FA24 in varied molar ratios as shown in Table 1 We will also add sodium dodecyl lauryl sulfate SDS CMC  82 mM at 25C representing a relatively harsh anionic surfactant that known for its interaction with the skin at a concentration above CMC to the as-prepared tethered lipid membrane systems The influence of lipid composition and concentration on the structure of SC lipid bilayers thickness and completeness the effect of the surfactant on the structure of the membranes and the location of the surfactant in the membranes will be investigated in this experiment After this initial round of measurements shows an effect we will consider investigating certain systems in more detail by specifically deuterating components to find out for examples which components are removed by the surfactant Figure 2 A schematic drawing of how surfactants can interact with SC lipids Walters Russel M et al 2013 In total we propose to structurally characterize 8 membrane models remeasuring after adding a surfactant using two solvent contrasts each adding up to 32 individual measurements Every measurement takes 6 h including time for sample setup and solvent exchange We therefore apply for a total of 12 days of beam time at NGD-MAGIK Table 1 The various lipid compositions and their molar ratios used to prepare the SC lipid membrane for neutron reflectivity experiments 8 samples Lipid Composition Molar Ratio nn CER EOS CER NSCHOLFA 18FA 24 10110 101066034 101034066 10101 034066110 0340661066034 0340661034066 034066101 3 References 1 Rawlings A V and C R Harding Moisturization and Skin Barrier Function Dermatologic Therapy vol 17 no 1 2004 pp 43-48 2 Harding Clive R The Stratum Corneum Structure and Function in Health and Disease Dermatologic Therapy vol 17 no 1 2004 pp 6-15 3 Wickett R R and Marty O Visscher Structure and Function of the epidermal barrier AJIC American Journal of Infection Control vol 34 no 10 2006 pp S98-S110 4 Melino Gerry Rainer Schmidt and Eleonora Candi The Cornified Envelope A Model of Cell Death in the Skin Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology vol 6 no 4 2005 pp 328-340 5 Mojumdar Enamul H et al Skin Lipids Localization of Ceramide and Fatty Acid in the Unit Cell of the Long Periodicity Phase Biophysical Journal vol 108 no 11 2015 pp 2670-2679 6 Bouwstra Joke A et al Structural Investigations of Human Stratum Corneum by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering Journal of Investigative Dermatology vol 97 no 6 1991 pp 1005-1012 7 Bouwstra J A et al Lipid Organization in Pig Stratum Corneum Journal of Lipid Research vol 36 no 4 1995 pp 685-695 8 Pilgram Gonneke S K et al Electron Diffraction Provides New Information on Human Stratum Corneum Lipid Organization Studied in Relation to Depth and Temperature Journal of Investigative Dermatology vol 113 no 3 1999 pp 403-409 9 Pilgram et al Cryoelectron Diffraction as a Tool to Study Local Variations in the Lipid Organization of Human Stratum Corneum Journal of Microscopy vol 189 no 1 1998 pp 71-78 10 Bouwstra J A et al Structure of Human Stratum Corneum as a Function of Temperature and Hydration A Wide-Angle X-Ray Diffraction Study International Journal of Pharmaceutics vol 84 no 3 1992 pp 205-216 11 Bouwstra Joke A and Gert S Gooris The Lipid Organisation in Human Stratum Corneum and Model Systems Open Dermatology Journal vol 4 no 1 2010 pp 10-13 12 Ananthapadmanabhan K P et al Cleansing without Compromise The Impact of Cleansers on the Skin Barrier and the Technology of Mild Cleansing Dermatologic Therapy vol 17 no 1 2004 pp 16-25 13 Walters Russel M et al Cleansing Formulations that Respect Skin Barrier Integrity Dermatology Research and Practice vol 2012 2012 pp 495917-9 14 Budvytyte R Valincius G Niaura G Voiciuk V Mickevicius M Chapman H et al 2013 Structure and properties of tethered bilayer lipid membranes with unsaturated anchor molecules Langmuir the ACS Journal of Surfaces and Colloids 2927 8645-8656 httpdoiorg101021la401132c
