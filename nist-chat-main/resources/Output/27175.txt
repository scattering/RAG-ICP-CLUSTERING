Investigation of pressure-induced quantum critical dynamics in an S12 quantum antiferromagnet Scientific Importance Quantum phase transitions  are a novel type of phase transition manifesting changes of the entire system from one quantum state to another in the extreme quantum limit at T0 K In actual experiments the control parameter can be chemical doping or external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure etc While the quantum critical point QCP exists at T0 K the so-called quantum critical regime QCR where the behavior of the system is strongly influenced by the critical point extends outward to finite temperatures In QCR the physical properties can be described by a set of critical exponents and scaling functions depending only on the symmetry and dimensionality but not on the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian In another word at the critical state the local dynamic structure factor S which can be directly determined by inelastic neutron scattering INS takes the scaling form as STT-b FkBT where b is the critical exponent and FkBT is a fully universal and dimensionless function  For instance the results near the magnetic field-induced QCP in Fig 1 from a recent work  show the universal finite-temperature scaling of ST Preliminary Work An S12 organic-metallic compound C9D18N2CuBr4 DLCB for short has been revealed recently  Based on view of crystal structure it is suggested to be coupled two-leg spin ladders The long-range antiferromagnetic AFM ordering below 20 K was revealed from specific heat and neutron diffraction measurements and the associated propagation wavevector is 12 12 12  Importantly the analysis of the spin Hamiltonian suggests that DLCB is close to QCP in two dimensions at ambient pressure and zero field  Since pressure is a clean method to tune the ground state continuously without introducing disorder we have carried out a single-crystal neutron diffraction study about effect of the hydrostatic pressure on the magnetic order using CTAX at HFIR Change of volume with pressure in NaCl was used for pressure calibration with an accuracy of 01 GPa We find that the staggered moment size measured at the AFM wavevector q 12 12 -12 becomes continuously diminished with increase of pressure Fig 2a At and above a critical pressure Pc10 GPa there is no evidence of magnetic Bragg peak with temperature at least down to 025 K The determined pressure dependence of the staggered moment size and ordering temperature is summarized in Fig 2b which suggests a quantum phase transition occurs at Pc Therefore it provides us a great opportunity for a test of the quantum critical scaling on DLCB In general it is difficult to carry out INS under pressure because of the limited sample space and the heavy attenuation of the neutron beam by the thick wall of clamp-type pressure cell Despite those technical challenges we have successfully managed to measure magnetic excitations in this S12 system using the high-flux cold neutron spectrometer MACS at NCNR The results in Fig 3 show the background-subtracted energy scans at AFM for various pressures The spectral lineshapes at ambient pressure and 02 GPa are spin-gapped owing to the Ising-type anisotropy and the observed two peaks corresponds to the transverse mode TM reflecting spin fluctuations perpendicular to the easy axis and the longitudinal mode LM reflecting spin fluctuation parallel to the easy axis The peak profiles of both TM and LM are limited by the instrumental resolution Surprisingly the spectral line shape of TM becomes significantly broader than the instrumental resolution at 106 GPa above Pc and such spectral broadening persists at least up to 13 GPa indicative of a novel ground state beyond QCP A detailed analysis is ongoing  Experiment Plan We first propose to determine the energy gaps at the AFM wavevector for two more pressures P05 and 09 GPa to have a detailed study of the pressure dependence of the anisotropic energy gaps After that we plan to change the pressure to 104 GPa slightly over Pc where LM becomes almost gapless and the spin gap of TM is 040 meV and then measure the energy scan at AFM and several temperatures as 03 K 08 K 15 K 3 K and 5 K The background will be determined under the same instrument configurations at T15 K We will seek to experimentally verify if ST follows the predicted scaling form as mentioned above Two separate sample-loaded pressure cells will be prepared for the experiment so that the measurements can be carried out more efficiently We estimate 4-day beam time for the first part and another 3-day beam time for the second part and request a total of 7-day beam time including the necessary time for the pressure change and sample cooling References  S Sachdev Quantum Phase Transition
