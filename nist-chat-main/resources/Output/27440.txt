Page 1 of 2 Investigate the polar nanoregions in a new ferroelectric binary compound Hf1-xYxO2 Scientific Importance Ferroelectric materials that have a switchable spontaneous dipole moment are of great technological interest for applications For example the unusual electromechanical properties of ferroelectric lead-oxide perovskite ABO3 relaxors have attracted considerable attention by the colossal piezoelectricity Most ferroelectric materials have crystal structures consisting of more than three atoms such as the lead-oxide perovskite relaxor ABO3 Very few ferroelectrics with two atoms have been reported Recently a breakthrough had been made in hafnium oxide thin films HfO2 thin films exhibit ferroelectricity when they are thinner than 10 nm So far ferroelectricity has not been observed in bulk HfO2 samples Recently we obtained bulk crystals of Y doped HfO2 Hf1-xYxO2 with 005  x  02 The polarization vs voltage P-V loop measured at room temperature exhibits typical ferroelectric behaviors see Fig 1A A polar orthorhombic phase Pca21 o-phase that was first discovered in Mg-doped ZrO2 at cryogenic temperatures is believed to be the structural origin for the recently reported ferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films at room temperature As shown in the Fig 1B powder X-ray diffraction XRD of our ground single crystal suggest that the space group is a polar o-phase Pca21 at room temperature Fig 1C shows the possible lattice structure in the bc plane for a polar o-phase HfO2 Polar nanoregions PNRs have been proposed to play important role in the ultrahigh electromechanical responses and dielectric properties in the relaxor-based ferroelectric materials like PbMg13Nb23O07PbTiO03 PNRs are usually considered to be specific to relaxor ferroelectric materials and they are rarely observed in Pb-free ferroelectric materials Our transmission electron microscopy TEM results suggest that the ferroelectric Hf1-xYxO2 is intrinsically associated with PNRs at room temperature as shown in Fig 2A The whiteblack contrast in the TEM images originates from polar domains with opposite polarizations The size of the polar domains is in a scale of hundred nanometers In relaxor ferroelectrics the role of randomly orientated PNRs is one of the most puzzling issues of materials science Understanding the ferroelectricity and PNRs of Hf1-xYxO2 calls for a detailed study of its lattice structure in a large length scale Hence we propose to perform Small-Angle Neutron Scattering SANS experiments on a Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal using NG7-SANS at NIST Center for Neutron Research NCNR since NG7-SANS enables the determinations of structure features in materials ranging from roughly 1 nm to over 500 nm External electric field will be also used as an external stimulus to induce the change of PNRs in the Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal The scattering patterns will be recorded a function of time and electric field to reveal the dynamical response of the PNRs in Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal Our results will provide new insights into the novel physics in ferroelectric binary compounds Preliminary Work Figure 1 A Ferroelectric polarization vs voltage for a Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal at room temperature Polarization was measured along c direction Pc B powder XRD and refinement patters for a ground single crystal sample A polar space group of Pca21 was used for the refinements C The lattice structure in bc plane for a polar o-phase HfO2 Green arrow suggests the ferroelectric polarization induced by the relative displacement between HfY and O We have measured the polarization vs voltage P-V loop at room temperature Typical ferroelectric behaviors was observed in the P-V loop as shown in Fig 1A We also performed powder XRD on a ground single crystal sample As shown in the Fig 1B powder XRD and refinement patters suggest that the space group might be a polar o-phase Pbc21 Fig 1C shows the lattice structure of a ferroelectric Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal Page 2 of 2 Figure 2 TEM image for a Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal at room temperature We also performed TEM on a single crystal sample As shown in the Fig 2A PNRs are observed in the whiteblack contrast in the TEM images The size of the polar domains is in a scale of hundred nanometers Choice of Instrument We need SANS data at room temperature to clearly determine signatures of structural properties of PNRs in Hf1-xYxO2 NG7-SANS is the most suitable instrument for our purpose since NG7-SANS enables the determinations of structure features in materials ranging from roughly 1 nm to over 500 nm Experiment Plan We propose to study the structural properties of PNRs in Hf1-xYxO2 by performing SANS measurements at room temperature at NG7 at NCNR External electric field will be also used as an external stimulus to induce the change of PNRs in the Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal The scattering patterns will be recorded a function of time and electric field to reveal the dynamical response of the PNRs in Hf1-xYxO2 single crystal High-quality single crystals  2 g have been synthesized We plan to measure three Hf1-xYxO2 single crystals with x  005 01 and 02 to determine the chemical ratio dependence of the PNRs in Hf1-xYxO2 We request a total of 4 day to look at these scans for the good statistical accuracy including the time for sample loading We will simulate the experimental data using the programs of SasView and Igor Pro Response to Previous Panel This is a new submission to NG7 Safety Considerations Samples are stable and all measurements are safe
