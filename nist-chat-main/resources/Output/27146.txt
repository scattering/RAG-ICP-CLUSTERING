on April 30 2014 the World Health Organization declared that antimicrobial resistance AMR is an imminent threat to global public health1 Since the 1940s numerous -lactam antibiotics have been used successfully to treat gram-positive G and gram-negative G- bacterial infections However bacteria become resistant to -lactams by producing -lactamase that breaks the -lactam ring or by altering the structures of the penicillin-binding proteins With fluoroquinolone antibiotics bacteria have acquired resistance by gaining resistance-defining substitutions in topoisomerases producing proteins that cannot bind to the quinolones or by pumping the quinolones out through active efflux Limited therapeutic options for G- bacteria have forced infectious disease microbiologists to devise new strategies for fighting infection One solution is the rational design of new antimicrobial peptides AMPs Our group has designed and tested many peptides with various amounts of alpha-helicity amphipathicity and hydrophobicity 2-8 One possibility is to design peptides that are derivatives of the multifunctional respiratory host defense protein SPLUNC1 short palate lung and nasal epithelium clone 1 25kD which is highly expressed in normal eukaryotic airways but dramatically decreased during allergic reactions It has been demonstrated that the SPLUNC1 protein exerts in vitro antimicrobial properties9 Our recent studies have focused on short derivatives of SPLUNC1 4 and 4-M1 both 30 amino acid residues and 4-short 24 AAs1011 where these peptides are effective at killing bacteria in suspension as well as in biofilms They are less toxic to red blood cells than other AMPs10 Our group carries out X-ray scattering at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source CHESS and at CMU where we obtain both elastic parameters bending modulus and structural results arealipid bilayer thickness but determining the position of the peptides in the membrane is difficult due to weak electron contrast between lipids and peptides Our preliminary electron density profiles for the recently studied AMP WLBU2 interacting with G- bacterial membrane mimics did not decisively select either an external position Fig 1a or an internal position Fig 1b by comparing the chi-squares obtained while fitting a bilayer model to the data In our last two NCNR proposals we proposed to study WLBU2 and WLBU2-D8 containing all 8 valines as the d-enantiomer We were allocated beam time and have made many A B Figure 1 Electron density profiles EDPs for G- IM mimics containing WLBU2 2501 lipidpeptide molar ratio Component

POPCPOPEcholesterol 5127 and Euk50 POPCPOPEcholesterol 516 We also tried to use G- outer membrane OM model KDO2DLPG 13 but this highly charged membrane was unstable and did not achieve 99 coverage on the sparsely tethered wafer so we increased the companion lipid DLPG to a KDO2DLPG molar ratio of 111 which successfully covered the silicon wafer Since WLBU2 and D8 both kill G- and G membranes similarly12 we were gratified to find that their location in these membranes was similar In both G- and G they located primarily in the headgroup region but also in the hydrocarbon region These data have been written up into a manuscript which will be submitted shortly for publication Fig 2 summarizes the locations of WLBU2 and D8 that were obtained using neutron reflectivity Figure 2 Component

derivatives of the SPLUNC1 protein We have designed several new derivatives which have varying bactericidal and toxic effects we will look for structural correlates to their activities Derivatives will include three peptides 4 4-M1 and 4-short that will each be studied using 6 membrane models G- IM G- OM LPSDLPG G- OM KDO2DLPG G Euk30 and Euk50 Every experiment consists of a control measurement of the bilayer without peptide and a measurement with peptide using D2O and H2O bulk solvents The instrument requested is MAGIK equipped with a pencil detector Assuming 6 hours to set up and align the NIST wet cell and 6 hours per measurement 288 total we request 16 days of beamtime which allows for duplications in case of aggregation Publications and Impact Recently we have published seven papers cited 290 times that have utilized complementary neutron and x-ray scattering to determine lipid bilayer structureRefs13-19 3 1 WHO Antimicrobial resistance WHO Global Report on surveillance
