Effect of Molecular Weight and Solvent Evaporation on the Solid-State Conformation of Poly3-Hexylthiophene and Polystyrene Blends using Small-Angle Neutron Scattering This is a coupled proposal for both NGB-30 SANS and BT5 USANS instruments Motivation Organic electronic devices such as photovoltaics field-effect transistors and chemosensors provide lightweight low cost and flexible alternatives to their inorganic equivalents1-3 however their wide scale implementation relies in part on the performance of the conjugated polymer CP present in their active layer CP performance can be tuned by structural modifications1 but they remain expensive compared to commodity polymers and prone to environmental degradation and undesirable mechanical failures eg cracking4-6 As an alternative researchers have explored blends of a CP with a commodity polymer to reduce overall cost and improve both mechanical and environmental stability while maintaining electronic performance Goffri and coworkers investigated blends of poly3-hexylthiophene P3HT with a matrix of either polystyrene PS or polyethylene4 They found that crystallinity in the matrix encouraged crystalline self-assembly of the P3HT enabling charge transport and having a minimal effect on device performance at P3HT concentrations as low as 3 wt Qiu et al found significant improvement in environmental stability for a blend of P3HT and PS compared to a pure P3HT layer Figure 17 Han et al found that both PS molecular weight and the solvent used in the precursor solution affected performance of ammonia-sensing devices utilizing a P3HTPS blend6 Considering work in the literature4-6 and our preliminary results discussed below we know that the processing methods eg solvent evaporation and composition for these blends significantly impact the final morphology and performance in the final solid-state form However the underlying polymer-polymer interactions and mechanisms are not yet fully understood preventing full control in designing improved conjugated and non-conjugated polymer blends In this work we aim to employ small-angle neutron scattering SANS to understand how the size and concentration of polystyrene as well as the solvent evaporation for blends of P3HT and PS affect the final morphology in the solid state Preliminary Data It is difficult to quantitatively characterize the structure and morphology for a blend of two similar materials ie polymers however selective deuteration and neutron scattering enable us to do exactly that By fully deuterating the PS component we can extract the structure of P3HT even at the extremely dilute limits using small-angle neutron scattering SANS Our preliminary results for these systems include VSANS and USANS data for a collection of samples with either regio-regular P3HT RRe-P3HT semi-crystalline or regio-random P3HT RRa-P3HT amorphous blended with deuterated polystyrene In past experiments we varied P3HT concentrations and solvents utilized in the precursor solutions to prepare bulk solid samples For both RRa-P3HT and RRe-P3HT we observe significant phase separation in the blends see Figure 2 RRa-P3HT tends to form spherical-like regimes to a fractal structure as concentration increases Conversely we observe a growth of crystalline nanofibers at the low-Q limit that develop into a complex network as RRe-P3HT concentration is increased The nanofiber growth is indicated by a feature that we have seen in past work8 from our group growing between 001 and 01 -1 Shown in Figure 3 we compare blends of RRe-P3HT and PS at dilute and concentrated limits of P3HT and dried from precursor solutions with 3 different solvents toluene chloroform and bromobezene which are intermediate good and excellent solvents for P3HT Moreover these solvents have a wide range of evaporation PureP3HT P3HTPS1090 Figure 1 Charge transfer performances for devices utilizing pure P3HT and P3HTPS blend layers compared over 1 week Figures are from the work of Qiu et al7 rates with chloroform samples drying the quickest 30 minutes and bromobenzene the slowest 2 hours Due to the similarity of the data between 001 and 01 -1 for the 10wt RRe-P3HT samples these systems are all forming P3HT nanofibers of approximately the same thickness However when observing the 01wt RRe-P3HT samples we can see that nanofiber formation is more developed at lower concentrations for the toluene system If we investigate the low-Q limit for this data the turnover for the chloroform and bromobenzene samples is apparent in the USANS range while the data for the toluene systems continues to increase This is suggesting to us that the bromobenzene and chloroform systems are forming shorter branched nanofibers while the toluene system is forming longer nanofibers Interestingly this does not trend exactly with either solvent quality or evaporation rate suggesting that both of these factors could be affecting the mechanisms by which P3HT assembles during the drying process of these blends Weve analyzed our data utilizing a Porod analysis to understand the surface area to volume ratio interface concentration extracted from the Porod constant in our samples We show the Porod analysis results for RRe-P3HTPS blends dried from different solvents in Figure 3 If we imagine that most of the P3HT is present in nanofibers at similar thickness at all concentrations we can imagine how the surface area to volume ratio would not change as a function of nanofiber length or branching For the bromobenzene and toluene systems we do see these results as expected However the surface area to volume ratio increases for the chloroform system counterintuitive to either nanofiber growth or advancing phase separation This experiment will allow us to further investigate these preliminary results Also shown in Figure 3 are wide-angle x-ray scattering WAXS results collected at our home facility This allows us to characterize the crystallinity in all of our solid films The amorphous peaks at approximately 07 and 14 -1 are due to the polystyrene in the system However we can see the lamellar and pi-stacking peaks at approximately 03 and 17 -1 respectively for P3HT By comparing the relative intensities of these peaks in samples dried from chloroform and toluene we observe that the pi-stacking peak has a higher relative contribution to the crystallinity in toluene suggesting that more of the P3HT exists as nanofibers structures that have been shown in the literature89 to grow in the pi-stacking direction This information is important considering their application in devices as the degree direction and connectivity in the crystallization of P3HT directly impact charge transport mechanisms in these materials influencing electronic performance in the solid state Experimental Plan - SANS Our preliminary results suggest that the polystyrene is influencing the conformation and self-assembly of P3HT in the precursor solution and during solvent evaporation We hypothesize that by also modifying the PS molecular weight andor the PS concentration the degree of phase separation or nanofiber formation for RRa-P3HT and RRe-P3HT would be influenced by changes in the osmotic pressure assuming that the interactions between P3HT and PS are non-attractive This is the focus of another SANSUSANS proposal submitted Here we strive to answer the following questions by investigating the final conformation and morphology in the solid state of P3HT and PS blends 1 How does the presence of polystyrene at varying molecular weights affect the phase separation andor nanofiber formation of RRa-P3HT and RRe-P3HT in the final dry polymer blends 2 How does modifying the concentration of polystyrene also affect these mechanisms 3 How are these structures impacted by change in solvent quality and evaporation rate To answer these questions our proposed experiment will include solid-state samples of RRa-P3HTPS and RRe-P3HTPS blends We will utilize solvents of chloroform toluene or bromobenzene in the precursor solution but will also control evaporation rate for a subset of these to probe the effects of both solvent quality Figure 2 SANS and USANS data collected at the NCNR for polymer blends of regio-random top or regio-regular bottom poly3-hexyl thiophene RRe-P3HT or RRa-P3HT with deuterated polystyrene PS Samples were dried from precursor solutions with chloroform and the drying speed Finally we will vary the concentration of PS and the PS molecular weight 20 kgmol similar to P3HT molecular weight 100 kgmol and 400 kgmol We will work with our collaborator Christine Luscombe at the University of Washington to synthesize monodisperse materials for this experiment We will analyze this data with appropriate models including spheres and fractals RRa-P3HT systems and parallelepipeds RRe-P3HT nanofibers Moreover we will utilize the powerful Porod analysis to learn about the surface area between P3HT and PS in all our systems and how that changes as a function of polystyrene concentration and molecular weight conjugated polymer crystallinity RRe vs RRa and solvent Finally we will perform wide-angle x-ray scattering WAXS and impedance spectroscopy measurements at our home facility to characterize crystallinity in our blends and the morphology effects on electronic performance Each polymer blend sample will be heat pressed into a small wafer with a diameter of 16 cm and a thickness of 254 m These films will then be loaded on an aluminum frame to be loaded into the standard multi-position sample environment at the NCNR no temperature control Based on past experience with similar samples at the same thickness we estimate each sample to require approximately 3 hours of measurement to reach a Q value of at least 0002 -1 and ensure overlap with the corresponding SANS data Because we expect P3HT to self assemble in many of these systems approx 65 samples and controls we are requesting time on both NGB30 SANS and BT5 USANS to capture the full Q-range required for analysis We estimate that 9 days are required on BT5 USANS to complete this
