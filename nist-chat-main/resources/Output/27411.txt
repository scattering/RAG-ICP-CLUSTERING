 Polarized Neutron Scattering Study on Yb-based Breathing Pyrochlore REV 02-01-2016 Page 1 of 3 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH Scientific Importance A great deal of attention has been focused on magnetic systems exhibiting frustration not due to their geometry but rather from their underlying competing anisotropic interactions which stabilize a wide range of unusual phenomena Magnetic pyrochlore systems which consist of a network of corner sharing tetrahedra have been at the forefront of the research on frustrated magnets The nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction between the spins on a pyrochlore lattice cannot select a unique ordered state and thus results in a large ground state degeneracy Consequently quantum fluctuations are enhanced in these quantum spin systems Recently a new sub-class of materials called the breathing pyrochlores have attracted attention because the structure consists of two alternating main tetrahedra expanded and contracted  Here we propose to investigate the breathing pyrochlore system Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 BYZO whose structure can be seen in Fig 1a  The Yb3 4f13 ion effectively has a pseuodo-spin  Kramers doublet ground state separated by CEF splitting energy of 38 meV  Despite the Curie-Weiss temperature of -67 K indicating considerable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction no long-range order has been reported down to sub-Kelvin temperatures 1- First investigations of this material have revealed interesting features Magnetization data shows step like features at 35 T and 88 T as shown in Fig 2b  The plateaus between these features correspond to the AFM-coupled tetrahedron with Seff  0 in zero field being switched to the Seff  1 and 2 spin states by the increasing field The steps correspond to a singlet-triplet and triplet-quintet crossings respectively Specific heats studies below 1 K reveal a broad peak across temperature as shown in Fig 1c rather than a sharp peak that would be indicative of a phase transition The entropy change per Yb3 ion is calculated to be 14 JK consistent with the release of two degrees of freedom per spin tetrahedron The heat capacity measurements at low temperature demonstrate that a unique ground state is selected from the doublet ground state of the single-tetrahedral model  To this date the BP ground state of the BYZO is still an open question where a nontrivial quantum state and various scenarios are proposed to be considered as perturbation terms in the Hamiltonian 1 interaction between spin tetrahedral 2 partial ordering of dimers 3 a chiral

single crystal inelastic neutron scattering experiments on BYZO single crystal sample using the disc chopper spectrometer DCS at NIST CNCS at SNS and WAND2 diffractometer at HFIR  We have identified the crystal filed excitation levels using our single crystal sample which agrees with previously observed levels with powder samples Our study also shows interesting Q dependence of magnetic form factors and anisotropic response to applied magnetic field To investigate the magnetic ordering in these systems we carried out zero field ZF SR measurements on single crystalline BYZO at ISIS We observed no oscillations and thus no long-range ordered state down to 60 mK Recently we performed polarized neutron scattering study on BYZO at MACS spectrometer at NIST The data were collected at energy transfer E  05 meV with Final energy Ef 42 meV at 01 K We selected the scattering plane perpendicular to 111 direction for this experiment and for all our field studies DCS and WAND since our Tunnel Diode Oscillator measurements show the strongest anomaly when the field is applied along 111 direction Considering the resolution of the instrument at this energy it effectively captured all the CEF excitations Figure 2 shows the background subtracted data of Spin Flip SF and Non-Spin Flip NSF channel We observed considerable difference between the SF and NSF channel Sharp features were observed in the SF channel around 11-2 reciprocal lattice point Very recently a theoretical study proposed BYZO breathing pyrochlore system as a candidate for rank-2 U1 spin liquid candidate  Their MC simulations predict 4-Fold Pinch Points 4FPPs as shown in Figure 3 The pinch points are more visible in the h0 scattering plane compared to hh plane Although the difference between SF and NSF channels in our data shows some similarities our scattering plane 1-1 - 11- is not ideal to observed the 4FPPs Therefore a follow up polarized neutron scattering experiment in the h0 scattering plane will provide great information about BYZO as a candidate for rank-2 U1 spin liquid candidate Figure 3  Spin structure factor of the breathing pryochlore lattice model for experimentally-motivated

experiment to perform single crystal polarized inelastic scattering experiment We will need a dilution refrigerator to go down to 01 K Experiment Plan We will orient the single crystal in the h0 scattering plane At base temperature 01 K similar to our previous experiment we will measure at E  05 meV with Ef  42 meV We will measure both SF and NSF channel with Vertical field configuration Background measurements will be taken at higher temperature Considering the time to properly prepare the dilution refrigerator change the He3 cell and to conduct the experiment with good statistics we estimate 7 days of beam-time are required References 1 K Kimura S Nakatsuji T Kimura Experimental realization of a quantum breathing pyrochlore antiferromagnet Physical Review B 90 2014 2 J G Rau et
