ABSTRACT Many intermetallics exhibit unique magnetic properties that are inherently tied to the crystal structure of the material Understanding the relationship between mechanical distortion of the lattice ie strain and magnetic functionality is important for predictive modeling efforts as well as material property optimization for a multitude of applications Here we propose to use small-angle neutron scattering SANS to study the concept of strain-induced renormalization and modulation of ferromagnetic order in the half metallic ferromagnet NiMnSb Recent theoretical work has predicted that uniaxial strain applied along high symmetry axes of F-43m ferromagnets should renormalize their ground states from a collinear state into a helical spin order Our proposed SANS measurement on NGB seeks to provide the first demonstration of this mode of magnetic state control via strain SCIENTIFIC MOVITVATION A topic of recent interest is the degree of control that can be realized over magnetic ground states via the application of strainstrain gradients and the subsequent activation of chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya cDM interactions While strain gradients can always lift the inversion symmetry of centrosymmetric space groups and allow anti-symmetric couplings more intriguingly recent theoretical studies have suggested that a homogeneous strain alone can also control chiral magnetic interactions1 The road map shown in Figure 11 was proposed detailing which space groups could yield a strain-induced renormalization of their magnetic ground states depending on whether a strain or strain gradient was applied For instance given the appropriate starting symmetries ferromagnetism can be driven into helical and cycloidal order under the application of a uniaxial strain field Specifically materials with the common space group F-43m are predicted to form a helical lattice when a uniaxial strain is applied along a high symmetry axis This space group encompasses half Heuslers and inverse Heuslers2-4 and we propose to explore this effect in NiMnSb5-7 Aside from having the requisite space group this material also has a high ferromagnetic Curie temperature TC allowing for measurements at room temperature and a large ordered moment making it a good starting point for this project Our preliminary theoretical analysis based on an applied load along the 111 axis with a magnetic fieldmeasurement perpendicular to the load direction shows that we expect to see a canted wave in the plane normal to the load direction detected as a single large-wavelength q-peak Our preliminary estimates show that strain levels as small as 01 can generate this effect with wavelengths approaching 100 nm with increased experimentally accessible strain levels We have successfully grown a large crystal of NiMnSb shown in Figure 2 using the Czochralski process As a preliminary proof of concept a small sample of this crystal was cut and placed in a strain device that applies a tensile force through the turning of a lead screw Magnetization versus Figure 1 The Road Map developed via symmetry arguments for strain-control of magnetism1 applied field measurements Figure 4 of the sample during various load steps were conducted using a SQUID magnetometer While the exact strain in the sample is unknown the results show a significant drop in magnetization 847 in response to the strain which is consistent with a strong coupling of the spins to strain The magnetization is also shown to increase when the sample is relaxed and then decrease again when strain is reapplied This result is unexpected in the saturated state and we hope our SANS measurements will help further understand what is occurring under these loads Furthermore we have also fabricated a load frame capable of applying comparable and greater uniaxial strains to our single crystal during a SANS measurement Fig 2 With collaborator Sam Daly8 we will characterize various applied loads by using digital image correlation DIC to map local strain fields on the crystal sample We will then apply the same calibrated loads to the sample during SANS measurements and quantitatively assess the impact of strain on the magnetic ground state This project is part of a larger collaboration including theoretical collaborators Anton Van der Ven and Irene Beyerlein who will develop both local and phase field models of the strain induced response PROPOSED EXPERIMENT ON NG7 We propose to perform a small-angle scattering experiment exploring the strain-induced magnetic response of NiMnSb The sample will be cut to 5x5x1 mm3 volume and loaded into our strain rig Fig 2 Both the rig and sample will be aligned such that the high symmetry cubic a-axis is both oriented parallel to ki where there is a large transmission pathway and such that strain is applied along the equivalent out-of-plane cubic b-axis The sample will be magnetized in the scattering plane using the electromagnetic field available on NG7 such that the moments are oriented perpendicular to ki along the c-axis and scans will be collected at room temperature under both zero strain and under applied strain Our rig is capable of applying 05 strain to the Figure 3 Net magnetization data as a function of applied magnetic field for various strain steps The strain device applies strain via lead screw and so the steps are denoted by the number of screw turns Figure 2 left A NiMnSb crystal grown with the Czochralski Process right Our load frame design for controlling uniaxial strain fields in NiMnSb sample and we will try the highest strain first to investigate any changes in the low angle magnetic scattering due to long wavelength modulation of the moments We will also explore hysteresis after releasing this strain field by remeasuring the strain-free magnetic structure If an effect is observed we will step through a series of intermediate strain fields 6 to record the evolution of the magnetic texture as a function of strain field Finally we will remove the sample from the strain rig and record a background scan for our data analysis From our initial calculations the modulation of the moments should be of the order 100 nm given the strain fields we can apply which make NG7 an ideal choice for this measurement We request 3 days of time for this exploratory study If time is not available on NG7 VSANS would also work this experiment REFERENCES 1 Kitchaev D A Beyerlein I J  Van der Ven A Phenomenology of chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in strained materials Phys Rev B 98 3-8 2018 2
