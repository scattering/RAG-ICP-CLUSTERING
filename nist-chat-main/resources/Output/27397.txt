Introduction and Background The Earths upper mantle is made of a silica-poor rock known as peridotite which is composed chiefly of the minerals olivine and pyroxene Within the oceanic crust tectonic forces exhume these rocks from mantle depths and bring them into contact with seawater where they are extremely thermodynamically unstable This thermodynamic instability leads to a hydration reaction known as serpentinization that converts them to voluminous hydrous serpentine minerals Serpentinization involves the oxidation of iron and concomitant reduction of water to produce hydrogen gas an important chemical energy source capable of sustaining ancient metabolic pathways For this reason serpentinization reactions are the centerpiece of one of the prevailing theories for the origin of life on Earth and conceivably other planets McCollom and Seewald 2013 Moreover the generated H2 can combine with CO2 to form methane fluxes of which greatly affect the oxidation state and habitability of earths ocean-atmosphere system at a global scale These various implications of serpentinization have made it a popular topic of study in disciplines ranging from astrobiology to geochemistry for at least the past century However important knowledge gaps regarding the fundamental mechanisms of this reaction remain Specifically although our recent USANS work has demonstrated that the porosity formed during serpentinization provides crucial pathways to supply fluid and reactants to the alteration front and thus explains the longstanding question of how virtually impermeable serpentinites commonly become fully hydrothermally altered Tutolo et al 2016 the creation of porosity during serpentinization is paradoxical from a volumetric standpoint As acknowledged in that previous study serpentinization increases solid volume by up to 50 meaning that the porosity of fully serpentinized peridotite should actually be negative This paradox has led to the question of whether the serpentine-hosted porosity we are measuring at ambient pressures is actually representative of that accompanying the serpentinization reaction or whether it results from depressurization during sampling In fact several studies Katayama et al 2012 Hatakeyama et al 2017 have shown that compaction associated with lithospheric pressure leads to a reduction of permeability in serpentinites which is interpreted as a reduction in total porosity and overall change in pore shapes sizes and connectivity However these inferences could not be verified because neutron scattering is the only known analysis that will permit the interrogation of serpentinite porosity under in situ pressures and such measurements have not yet been performed Such decrease in permeability has also been shown to level off for confining pressures higher than 500 bars To address this question we propose to investigate serpentinite porosity in situ using high-pressure cells and combined Small and Ultra Small Angle Neutron Scattering USANS is a powerful tool to address this question since it can interrogate over the scale of the most relevant porosity ie that in the 1 nm - 10 m size range the in situ porosity and pore size distribution in serpentinized peridotites The resultant data will allow to link diffusivity values to specific pore size ranges and quantify their contribution to the overall flow in the serpentinites The data produced with this experiment at the nanoscale will be instrumental to the production of accurate numerical models that will be used to address crustal-scale problems such as calculating the extent of serpentinization along oceanic faults which will enable quantitative constraints on the chemical fluxes from the lithosphere to the oceans over Earths history Proposed Experiments The experimental procedure proposed here aims to measure the porosity in serpentinite samples showing increasing degrees of alteration at in situ pressure Tutolo et al 2016 demonstrated that serpentinites have significant scattering intensity over the range from Q  10-2 -10-5 -1 thus necessitating both SANS and uSANS analyses We intend to use the NGB-30 m SANS and CHRNS uSANS instruments Provided that both proposals are accepted we would prefer to perform both SANS and uSANS analyses during one visit to the NCNR If scheduling permits we will first perform SANS and then uSANS on up to 4 geologic samples depending on sample availability size - ie aperture diameter - and variability To satisfactorily obtain statistically significant sample sizes the largest aperture possible typically  or 58 but this will depend on the pressure cell will be used To capture the real porosity values that the altered peridotite experienced while undergoing serpentinization we propose to collect SANS and uSANS data at increasing steps of confining pressure 125 bars increments each up to a maximum of 500 bars In order to isolate the effect of pressure and to prevent the activation of dissolutionprecipitation reactions that would inevitably affect the porous network experiments will be performed at room temperature where serpentinization reactions are kinetically slow These experiments will require use of the NCNR stainless steel high pressure cell where neutron beams will be directed through the cells sapphire windows The procedure will be a simplified version of the one described in Chiang et al 2018 since for this project there would no need to employ helium Four samples have been selected and each one will have to be measured 5 times at room pressure 125 250 375 and 500 bars for a total of 20 measurements Experience dictates that 48 hours on the SANS instrument should be more than sufficient to perform 20 measurements In order to achieve sufficient counting times on uSANS however we are requesting 4 days of total uSANS instrument time The information gained from the porosity and pore size distribution of serpentinites showing increasing degrees of alteration will be complimented with a range of techniques performed at the University of Calgary Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM imaging data will be acquired from the same thick sections used for the uSANS measurements to constrain the spatial occurrence of the pores and their relationship with the adjacent phases Electron microprobe EMP and confocal Raman mapping will reveal the detailed chemistry of the samples The total porosity determined by uSANS will be compared with independent measurements by helium pycnometry to detect the potential presence of pore space with a size that falls outside the SANS and uSANS Q range Samples We propose to perform uSANS measurements on partially and completely serpentinized dunites and harzburgites rocks The samples were collected at OCCs adjacent to the Middle Atlantic Ridge MAR during International Ocean Discovery Program IODP expeditions The chosen samples display increasing degrees of serpentinization which will allow to record consecutive snapshots of the evolution of porosity during progressive stages of the reaction The serpentinites have been obtained through a request to the Bremen Core Repository and are therefore already available Standard 150 m thick section samples which are required to prevent multiple neutron scattering Anovitz et al 2013 will be prepared by Vancouver Petrographics Inc typical turnaround time 3 weeks mounted using acetone-soluble glue on quartz glass Prior to analysis the samples will be floated off of the slides by soaking in acetone saturated with deionized water for at least 1 week and placed into the pressure apparatus Primary and secondary minerals in the serpentinite specimens include lizardite chrysotile olivine orthopyroxene clinopyroxene spinel brucite magnetite Their scattering length densities will be calculated using the NIST activation calculator prior to processing Anticipated Impact of the Measurements The proposed experiment will test the hypothesis that serpentinization generates new porosity which bears fundamental implications to understand the mechanism that allows virtually impermeable rocks of peridotitic composition to become completely serpentinized The high-resolution datasets produced will constrain the range of porosities achievable in serpentinites which values currently reported in literature range from zero to 15 Toft et al 1990 The uSANS results will be a vital part of my PhD dissertation and will be published both in the latter and disseminated through peer-reviewed academic journals and through conference
