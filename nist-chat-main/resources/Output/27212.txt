Reversible Fuel Cell Water Management with Novel Electrode Structures Jacob Spendelow Siddharth Komini Babu Los Alamos National Laboratory PO Box 1663 MS D429 Los Alamos NM 87545  Scientific background and anticipated impact Unitized reversible fuel cells URFCs1 which combine a fuel cell FC and electrolyzer E in a single device could address the energy storage challenges associated with the use of intermittent renewable power sources Several technical barriers must be overcome before URFCs can compete in the marketplace including the barrier of poor mass transport to and from the oxygen catalyst Simultaneously maximizing FC and E performance as well as maintaining performance during repeated mode cycles are key challenges that can only be addressed by providing fast and effective transport in both FC and E modes Addressing the transport problem is especially difficult because of the conflicting water management requirements electrolyzers perform best with high liquid water saturation whereas fuel cells perform best when liquid water saturation is as low as possible while still maintaining effective ionomer hydration We are working to address transport problems in URFCs through implementation of novel electrode and transport layer microstructures that segregate different transport functionality into different structures2 By enabling effective transport under a wide range of operating conditions we can eliminate the need to compromise between the two operating modes Our approach involves using microstructural patterning techniques to vary the local transport properties creating alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic channels that enhance transport in FC and E modes respectively Hydrophobic channels can remain liquid free even under the most saturated conditions enabling effective gas transport while hydrophilic channels can provide effective liquid water transport We are working to apply this approach to electrodes as well as diffusion media By enabling high performance fuel cell operation even when flooded our approach should allow near-instantaneous switching between FC mode and E mode enabling use of URFCs to deal with short-term grid perturbations as well as long-term fluctuations However direct measurement of water saturation levels in the different transport channels is critically necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach and build understanding of the relationship between local water saturation and water and O2 transport  Experimental details high resolution imaging We have recently developed three types of structured electrodes with transport channels for improved operation under a wide range of operating conditions and water saturation levels Fig 1 By incorporating dedicated H and O2 transport channels we can enable effective transport of these reactants even under challenging operating conditions However we currently lack understanding of how these channels affect the local water distribution and this knowledge is needed to enable optimization of our design Neutron radiography measurements could provide this much needed information We propose to quantify the water distribution in electrodes with channel widths of 10 and 50 m using high-resolution imaging We will also image electrodes with several types of O2 channels based on different materials These channels are constructed with superhydrophobic macropores to enable O2 diffusion unimpeded by liquid water even under cold and wet conditions but determining the effectiveness of different structures at avoiding liquid water saturation requires in operando imaging We will examine electrodes containing O2 channels based on the following types of structures 1 Packed PTFE nanopowders 2 PTFE-coated carbon blacks 3 Perfluoroalkyl-functionalized carbon blacks Imaging of MEAs with these O2 channels at two channel widths under a range of conditions including cold  40C and wet 100 RH feed will provide a quantitative understanding of how effective these structures are at minimizing liquid water saturation within the O2 channels Correlating liquid water saturation with fuel cell performance will be instrumental in guiding our design of electrodes with enhanced transport and enhanced performance under challenging operating conditions Performing the proposed measurements will require use of the high-resolution imaging capabilities at the NIF3 Measurements on the larger feature size electrodes 50 m channel width will be performed with a gadolinium oxysulfide scintillator detection system viewed by an sCMOS camera providing 10 m resolution Smaller feature size electrodes 10 m channel width will require higher resolution which will be achieved by event reconstruction of neutron capture4 This approach involves magnifying the scintillation light from a gadolinium oxysulfide scintillator and calculating the center of mass of the scintillation event resulting in an event-based imaging detector with spatial resolution of about 2 m This approach should be sufficient to adequately resolve the O2 channels and quantitatively measure effects of channel structure on local water saturation and the 34 mm field of view will be sufficient to look for variations and non-uniformities in different parts of the electrode We have previously demonstrated high resolution in operando fuel cell imaging using this approach verifying our ability to image with 2 m resolution5  Anticipated Beam Time The anticipated run time of Neutron imaging for the experiments is five days This time allotment would allow two days to measure 3 different O2 channel structures at the 50 m channel width Figure 1 H channel electrode left O2 channel electrode center and multi channel electrode right under a range of operating conditions The remaining 3 days would be devoted to measuring the 10 m O2 channel structures which would be slower due to the use of the magnification and centroiding approach requiring 4-8 hours exposure per sample Due to the length of time required for the highest resolution measurements only two operating conditions coldwet at 40C 100 RH 1 Acm2 plus hotdry at 80C 25 RH 05 Acm2 will be used for the 10 m channel width samples LANL will supply the cell hardware and all the fuel cell materials  References 1 B Paul J Andrews PEM unitised reversibleregenerative hydrogen fuel cell systems
