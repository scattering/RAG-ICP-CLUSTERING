Experimental Validation of Coal Gasification with Neutron Imaging Charles EA Finney1 D Barton Smith1 Costas Tsouris1 James E Parks1 Jacob M LaManna2 1Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL 2National Institutes of Standards and Technology NIST Motivation Coal gasification is a complex process that generates gas fuel syngas from pyrolyzing coal particles in an inert or partially oxidizing atmosphere Fig 1 Because of the complexity involved in the process theoretical simulations are critical to designing the next-generation advanced reactors Models used for such simulations including MFiX1 heavily rely on validation data for tuning and accuracy Measurement observations from the interior of operating gasifiers however are difficult to obtain Neutron imaging can be used to provide such measurements Objective and Approach The objective of the proposed work is to obtain nonintrusive visualization data and validation information to enable accurate simulations of coal gasification which includes pyrolysis The approach is to use neutrons which interact strongly with hydrogen and weakly with metals giving the ability to observe in situ coal pyrolysis and gasification The strategy followed in this project involves i studying a range of coal ranks to see which is best for neutron imaging and ii conducting pre-imaging pyrolysis experiments and analysis to optimize the imaging experiments Laboratory Work Various coal samples have been obtained including anthracite bituminous sub-bituminous and lignite These coal ranks have different hydrogen and moisture contents and behave differently with respect to pyrolysis Figure 2 shows mass loss of these coals vs pyrolysis temperature Among these coal ranks bituminous and sub-bituminous showed an interesting behavior during pyrolysis at temperatures over 400C As the temperature increased these samples showed a fluidic behavior over a temperature range After the volatiles escape the residual matter solidified again Additional laboratory experiments were performed inline of GCMS gas chromatographymass spectroscopy to analyze and identify the products of gasification Results from those experiments agree qualitatively with the results of Fig 2 Cold coal falling in Drying devolatilization Char gasification Char combustion Ash and unburned carbon-cooled by inlet flow Syngas Air and Steam in Ash out Coal Figure 2 Mass loss vs pyrolysis temperature for various coal ranks Figure 1 Updraft moving-bed gasifier for coal gasification Preliminary Neutron Imaging Work In preliminary experiments at BT-2 we imaged a series of coal samples which had been pyrolyzed in a laboratory reactor at ORNL as well as unpyrolyzed samples originally 1 cm diameter and 12 cm high Radiography results are shown in Fig 3 Tomography measurements were also performed with neutrons and x-rays to construct 3D images of coal samples after pyrolysis as shown in Fig 4 Proposed Work The next phase of imaging experiments is to perform radiography of a bed of fine particles 300-1000 m sub-bituminous or lignite coal particles In these experiments the pyrolyzer will be heated using an inert inlet gas flow N2 according to a programmed temperature ramp much like TGA and images will be collected every 15-30 sec over the course of a 1-3 hour experiment During the pyrolysis process considerable temperature gradients will occur vertically in the bed with the hottest zone at the gas inlet pyrolyzer bottom pyrolyzing and releasing hydrogenous compounds earlier than areas higher in the bed Figure 5 shows a cartoon of how the wave of pyrolysis traverses upward over time in the figure particle sizes are exaggerated greatly for illustration purposes and the exact spatio-temporal evolution is to be determined in the proposed experiments The goal of the dynamic neutron imaging is the map the hydrogen loss caused by drying and pyrolysis in both space and time these data will assist modelers Several of these dynamic in situ pyrolysis experiments with different parameters are planned We will then perform tomography of the pyrolyzed coal beds to map the bed final pyrolysis state in 3D A anthracite B bituminous C

sub-bituminous sample Figure 3 Radiographs show increasing neutron transmission with increasing pyrolysis temperature Figure 5 Schematic showing propagation of pyrolysis through a bed of coal particles as the inlet gas temperature is increased Particles are depicted much larger than actual for illustration purposes there are  105-106 particles in the bed and the actual spatio-temporal pyrolysis propagation map is to be determined in this study Required temporal resolution is 30-60 sec between radiographs and required spatial resolution is 50-100 m The experiments discussed above will require 3 days of beam time on BT-2 Expected Results and Implications Results from the proposed experiments will be used to better understand and model the coal pyrolysis process at both the particle and coalbed scales and obtain information that can be used to qualitatively in the short term and quantitatively in the long term verify predictive models at both scales Modeling work is currently performed by collaborators working on the same project at the National Energy Technology Laboratory Models have already been developed but not verified in terms of the behavior of coal particles and the moving pyrolysis front in the coalbed Imaging results from the proposed work will provide corrective feedback to the modeling effort and experimental support that will lead to more accurate predictions Thus the results will contribute toward the development of more effective pyrolysis and gasification reactors which will lead to an environmentally friendly fossil energy strategy with significant reductions in CO2 emissions as coal pyrolysis generates carbon-rich char that can be amended to soil and syngas for power production that can be coupled with CO2 capture and storage 1
