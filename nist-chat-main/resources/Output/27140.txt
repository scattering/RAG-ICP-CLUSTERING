Magnetic structure in multiferroic complex oxide superlattices R Steinhardt M E Holtz P B da Silva  R Ozgur R Ramesh D G Schlom AJ Grutter W D Ratcliff J A Borchers We have developed a material that is simultaneously ferroelectric and ferromagnetic at room temperature by combining hexagonal and cubic ferrites into epitaxial superlattices With polarized neutron reflectometry we propose to investigate the temperature-dependent magnetic depth profile before and after electrically biasing the sample to determine if electric field control of magnetism can be achieved in these heterostructures Electric field control of magnetism promised by room-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroic materials is an exciting prospect for next-generation memory devices However materials that couple magnetic and electrical ordering are exceptionally rare Despite over half a century of interest known single-phase magnetoelectric multiferroics still only include materials where at least one of the ferroic orders is weak the properties exist only below room temperature or both1 Indeed one of the best-characterized and most intriguing multiferroics BiFeO32 is a strong ferroelectric but a weakly canted antiferromagnet The goal of this work is to design and synthesize a strong multiferroic system ie a strong ferroelectric and strong ferromagnet with strong magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature Using a combination of geometric frustration polarization doping and epitaxial engineering we previously identified LuFeO39LuFe2O4 to be the first material that is both ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic at room-temperature3 Neutron diffraction was performed on the BT-4 triple-axis spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research to determine the onset of long-range magnetic order of a LuFeO36LuFe2O42 superlattice Neutron scattering is not sensitive to small impurity phases that may influence other bulk characterization techniques Magnetic reflections of the LuFeO36LuFe2O42 superlattice were observed in neutron diffraction by scanning along the 10 reciprocal lattice direction where the Miller index L is along the c-axis or growth direction at several temperatures between 5 K and 325 K We found a single 101 magnetic reflection indexed to the magnetic unit cell of 104 nm or two superlattice repeat distances at 5 K that was not present at room temperature X-ray linear dichroism XLD on the Fe-L23 edge was employed to determine the ferroelectric ordering temperature as a function of layering composition further x-ray magnetic circular dichroism XMCD measurements in PEEM demonstrated that this ferroelectric order was deterministically coupled to the magnetism at 200 K In the LuFeO39LuFe2O4 system however while the XLD measurements showed the ferroelectric order persisted above room-temperature the magnetic transition was 281 K Here we seek to enhance the magnetic transition to well-above room-temperature to further the device applicability of this material system Our present work introduces a chemical substitution to construct LuFeO3mCoFe2O4n superlattices Fig 1a-b The LuFeO3 in the material retains its polar structure as evidenced by scanning transmission electron microscopy STEM measurements and the films when incorporated onto Ir electrodes to make capacitive devices can be ferroelectrically switched Fig 1c These materials further demonstrate strong magnetic ordering at room temperature thanks to the 111 oriented cubic spinel ferrite with similar in-plane and out-of-plane magnetism Fig 1d It is thus a strong multiferroic systemstronger than any known at room temperaturebut is it strongly coupled Figure 1 a STEM overview showing a well ordered LuFeO3  CoFe2O4 superlattice grown on an Ir electrode the NCNR experiment will be on a corresponding sample grown with no electrode to enable back-gating b STEM showing the epitaxy between the c-plane in LuFeO3 and the cubic 111 surface of CoFe2O4 The LuFeO3

ferroelectricity and the ferromagnetism are coupled in these superlattices we wish to perform polarized neutron reflectivity on our superlattices in particular 5 nm LuFeO3  10x  33 nm CoFe2O4  5 nm LuFeO3 on yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia YSZ substrates using the PBR reflectometer preliminary results shown in Figure 2 The goal is to obtain the depth dependence of the magnetization through the superlattice bilayer and to determine the nature of the intrinsic coupling between one superlattice layer and the next We propose to ferroelectrically switch the superlattices over the entire surface of the sample and measure them in PBR to see if the magnetic signal changes with poling While we have grown these materials with epitaxial electrodes to enable biasing across the sample in our experience the films are too leaky to switch across large sample sizes and do better at low temperature 100 K Back-gating across a thinned substrate with no bottom electrode may prevent electrical leaking by adding a continuous insulating layer behind the sample although higher voltages must be applied Another option may be to create arrays of capacitor structures to switch a larger volume of film4 There are two interesting temperature regimes the room temperature case which is relevant to application where the LuFeO3 is antiferromagnetic and below 149 K where the antiferromagnetism in LuFeO3 is canted which may provide an additional mechanism to magnetically couple the layers We thus plan to examine these samples at 10 K and 295 K in a field of 3 T and in remanence Preliminary data shown in Figure 2 indicates that measurements of the non-spin flip R and R-- through the critical angle as well as the first and second order Bragg reflections provide sensitivity to both the chemical structure and the depth-dependent component of the magnetization parallel to the applied field Since the splitting between R and R-- at the weaker second order peak will be critical to determining the magnetic order at the interfaces the counting times will be long In remanence it will be necessary to measure the spin-flip cross sections R- and R-  to determine the orientation of the magnetization within the sample plane We anticipate that each tempfield condition will require 24 - 36 hours of beamtime We request a total of 8 days of beamtime in order to characterize fully 1-2 samples in poled and unpoled conditions at both cryogenic and room temperature If poling measurements show no discernable differences we will examine the additional samples with different layer thicknesses to explore the relative layer thickness dependence of the coupling Figure 2 a Preliminary polarized neutron reflectometry and theoretical fits showing a surface reflections and the first two superlattice peaks
