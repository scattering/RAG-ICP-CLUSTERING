Effect of cholesterol concentration on cholesterol transfer flip flop and exchange Cholesterol is an essential component of mammalian cellular membranes it is required for diverse functions from regulating the physical properties of the membrane such as membrane permeability and fluidity to controlling in-planeacross membrane organization through the formation of lipid rafts12 to being directly involved in regulating integral membrane protein function3 Further it has recently been found that cholesterol is asymmetrically distributed across the plasma membrane with a 12-fold higher concentration in the outer-facing leaflet to the inner-facing endoplasmic leaflet4 Lipids are also asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane saturated lipids are enriched in the outer leaflet while in the inner leaflet it is unsaturated lipids5 The main process by which cholesterol is maintained in cells is through its synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum ER6 though up to 30 is imported from food and delivered via endocytosis of low-density lipoproteins7 The level of cholesterol varies greatly among cellular organelles and this level is a crucial component for maintaining organelle identity This phenomenon is most dramatically represented in the plasma membrane PM which contains 60-80 of cellular cholesterol which is about 35-45 of the lipid content589 In contrast in the ER which is the site of cholesterol synthesis only 1-10 of the lipid molecules are cholesterol5910 Even though the delivery of cholesterol to cells both via lipoproteins and via the biosynthetic pathway is well characterized the molecular mechanisms for cholesterol transport within membranes and across the cell remain unclear An important question we will like to address concerns cholesterol transport within membranes and the importance of its concentration with respect to the lipid environment As mentioned earlier cells maintain their cholesterol content at very different levels among organelles even though there is extensive vesicular and non-vesicular transport primarily because of differences in the components in the respective membranes of those organelles such as lipids and proteins591112 In the same manner distribution within a membrane needs to be considered4 Because cholesterol is thought as highly mobile flipping quickly between the membranes bilayered leaflets13 one would expect the cholesterol distribution within a membrane to be quickly homogenized However because cholesterol is susceptible to interactions with other lipids such as many sphingolipids which are enriched in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and specific proteins a non-uniform distribution across a membrane may indeed be favored4912 Despite its importance a complete understanding of cholesterol transport behavior in cells remains elusive To explore the cholesterol transport properties various studies have been done in vitro and in vivo however progress in this area is hampered by a wide range of reported values for intra- and inter-membrane cholesterol transport rates For example reported half-lives for inter-membrane exchange range from many hours14 down to tens of minutes15 On the other hand the reported half-life for trans-membrane cholesterol flipping varies from several hours16 to a few seconds17 down to even a few milliseconds18 Recent MD simulations show that passive cholesterol flip-flop in POPC monounsaturated membranes is fast 15 microseconds19 while we have shown experimentally using Time-Resolved SANS combined with contrast matching that it takes a few hours depending on the sample temperature20 Therefore we propose here to investigate the flipping and exchange behavior of cholesterol at different concentrations from 5 to 40 mole in saturated and unsaturated lipids membranes in order to resolve this conundrum One possible reason of slow flipping could be that the high cholesterol concentration in our system slows down cholesterol motion as it wont be as free in the environment of the lipids Figure 1 shows preliminary results of cholesterol transfer in deuterated DPPC at 2 different cholesterol concentrations showing a possible cholesterol concentration effect To obtain the flipping rates through cholesterol transfer we analyze the variation of the scattering intensity as a function of time when visible donor cholesterol loaded vesicles will be mixed with invisible acceptor vesicles as previously published20 The results from this investigation will give clues about cholesterol transport and the dependence of transport on concentration and lipid saturation in membranes Figure1 Reduced intensity as a function of time for cholesterol transfer into d62DPPC vesicles at 20 and 40mol of cholesterol at 62C Total vesicle concentration is 10mgml It is clear that the transfer is concentration dependent Quantitative analysis is under way Specific Plan We will study the kinetics of the exchange and flip-flop of cholesterol in SUVs 100nm in saturated lipid membranes such as deuterated di-palmitoyl-phosphatidyl choline dDPPC and deuterated di-steroyl-phosphatidyl choline dDSPC and unsaturated like deuterated di-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidyl choline dPOPC We will do these measurements at temperatures above Tm in the one phase region of the phase diagram The concentration of cholesterol in the donor vesicles will be 5 10 20 30 and 40mole The total vesicle concentration will be between 10-20 mgml Time required We require 4 days on VSANS We plan to use the white beam option in order to get the highest possible flux to track cholesterol transfer analysis uses the overall intensity versus time Indeed samples with 5 10 and 20 mole cholesterol will have little contrast as the solvent is matching the lipid Each measurement takes 618 hr on average depending on the sample temperature A total of 1216 samples will be measured at 4 different temperatures 50 60 70 80 in order to extract the concentration dependence of the activation energy of flipping and exchange We will request the Peltier sample changer so 3 temperatures could be run in parallel for the low temperature while for the higher temperatures it might not be possible to do so to capture the early time 1 Mouritsen OG  Zuckermann MJ Whats so special about cholesterol Lipids 39 1101-13 2004 2 Zuckermann MJ et al Modeling
