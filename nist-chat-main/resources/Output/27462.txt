Effect of Molecular Topology on Transport from Stabilized Emulsions to Continuous Phases Using Contrast Variation Very Small-angle Neutron Scattering Motivation Many pharmaceuticals are formulated as dispersions in interfacially stabilized emulsions to increase the medications poor solubility in water to protect the active pharmaceutical ingredient API from degradation andor to target a specific tissue or organ in the body Such Colloidal Drug Delivery Systems CDDS offer unique benefits such as improved targeting increased oral bioavailability injectability and stealth interactions that improve residence times 12 With the increased use of CDDS control over the bioavailability and the transport behavior of APIs from emulsified colloidal carriers becomes increasingly important to the design of new drug formulations and new medications with improved efficacy Previous research has shown that bulkier more spherical molecules as well as molecules with functional groups that can hydrogen bond or be associated with the solvent have slower diffusion in microcapillary measurements 3 Once these molecules are entrapped in a stabilized droplet we anticipate the interactions between the interfacial layer the molecule and the oil will affect the diffusion of the molecule into the bulk continuous phase Some properties of the layer to consider include the porosity of the surfactant material as well as the net thickness of the interface and the capacity of molecules to be adsorbed into the interfacial layer itself trapping the molecule at the surface of the droplet 4 Time-resolved contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering CV-SANS is an ideal method to measure and quantify the transport rates of un-tagged organic molecules within stable emulsion systems We recently demonstrated the value of CV-SANS in two separate publications in Langmuir that quantified oil-exchange rates in dilute emulsion systems as a function of alkane length surfactant typeconcentration and temperature while resting as well as during ultrasound activation 56 These experiments were performed by first generating identical emulsion droplets composed primarily of deuterated or hydrogenated long alkanes hexadecane dodecane octane After these two dispersions are mixed time equals zero we were able to use CV-SANS to track changes in contrast that occur due to molecular exchange As molecular exchange occurred contrast decreased see Figure 1 which was observable using time-resolved experiments on the Very-Small-Angle Neutron Scattering VSANS instrument at the NIST Center for Neutron Research NCNR Moreover this allowed us to track any changes in the average emulsion size as well Only with the new VSANS instrument at the NCNR could we perform these experiments efficiently It allows simultaneous measurement of scattering intensities over the entire q range without having to move detectors or repeat experiments Here we propose the use of the VSANS instrument and the application of contrast variation techniques to analyze the transport of dissolved molecules across emulsion interfaces that mimic the diversity of shapes and functional groups often found in colloidal drug-delivery vehicles Experimental Plan Our goal is to investigate how the rates of transport of oil-dissolved molecules into the bulk phase as a function of molecular shape ie branching functional groups nature of the stabilizing interface polymer vs lipid and temperature We will be using a deuterated version of the oil-in-water model system having either a phospholipid DLPC or polymer Pluronic F88 - Polyethylene Glycol Polypropylene Glycol Block Copolymer interfacial stabilizer Both of these emulsion stabilizers are routinely used in drug-delivery applications 78 These molecules will consist of fully hydrogenated C12 molecular analogues with variable functional groups eg n-dodecanol dodecanoic acid hexylbenzene and topology 6-dodecanol 5-propylnonane as well as real drugs of interest estradiol These molecules will allow us to probe the effects of molecular topology and presence of functional groups on transport rates To establish contrast matching we first identify conditions that result in minimal scattering contributions from the primarily deuterated dodecane-in-D2O emulsions D-dodecane has a scattering length density 666 x10-6 -2 that is greater than that of D2O 634 x10-6 -2 Thus a small amount of H-Hexadecane will be added to the oil-in-water emulsions in order to achieve minimum contrast conditions Deuterated polymer and lipid will also be used to minimize their scattering contributions and ensure that the source of contrast will primarily originate from the dissolved hydrogenated molecules of interest Once contrast matching conditions are found for the stabilized oil carriers the experiment will proceed to evaluate transport kinetics of dissolved molecules from the core of the contrast-matched oil droplets into the bulk solutions as a function of molecular size shape functional groups and interfacial stabilizers We will prepare concentrated dispersions of oil droplets 10 vol at the contrast matching condition for dodecane-in-water with a high concentration 30 vol of the oil of hydrogenated dissolved drug proxies As was done in our previous study we will use an ultrasound horn to produce nano-sized droplets typically 100-300 nm DLS will be used to ensure that emulsions are stable and similar in size and structure At time equals zero the emulsions will be diluted by 100x into pure D2O to induce a change in chemical potential that will result in the diffusion of hydrogenated molecules from the emulsions into the continuous phase During this time CV-SANS data will be collected over a broad Q-range to probe the accumulation of hydrogenated drug molecules in specific locations as well as for variations in droplet size This would allow us to probe for example if drug accumulation at the interface is a significant barrier for diffusion into the bulk This will also allow for the quantification of variations in droplet size and structure parameters as they release their payload The data will be analyzed using a polydisperse sphere model to obtain emulsion size distributions and contrast and using the relaxation-function analysis to track changes as a function of time We hypothesize that movement of molecules through the interfacial layer will be the largest resistance to transport and that larger bulkier and surface-active molecules will take longer to move past the interfacial layer into the bulk If this is the case we should be able to observe accumulation of drug at the interface in fits of the SANS data eg spherical vs core-shell form factors Based on previous experiments we anticipate that CV-SANS measurements will occur over a time-scale of minutes-hours for molecules of these sizes ie dodecane analogues 4 Since the exact transport time-scale of these new drugs is not known a-priori we will come prepared with a larger set of molecules of increasing molecular weight eg C16 vs C12 analogues to adjust the relaxation time to be suitable for the experimental time Alternatively we will be able to adjust the sample temperature to either slow or accelerate the transport process We anticipate that scattering will be strong but will also be ready to adjust VSANS to run in the white-beam configuration This increases neutron flux reduces count times but also prevents the extraction of detailed structural parameters due to smearing Thus we will only use it if absolutely necessary For each sample a control will be diluted for a long time 24 hours in advance of the sample measurement Such controls will be equivalent to achieving the infinite time limit for the molecular exchange Controls will be run prior to each sample in order to ensure that the relaxation is measurable within the time-scales of the experiment hours We plan to run 3 samples for each molecule of interest bare emulsion no stabilizer Pluronic F88 stabilized emulsion and DLPC-stabilized emulsion We estimate that each sample will require 120 minutes of counting time to achieve complete diffusive relaxation of their payload to the new equilibrium value We have 6 molecules of interest to test in our model system described above and anticipate having to repeat some runs in order to find adequate counting rates 2hr6 molecules 3 interfaces  36 hours We may also need to run some samples at reduced temperatures to slow the diffusion rates if too quick In addition we anticipate that finding contrast matching conditions and aligning the instrument will take approximately 6 hours With this in mind and accounting for the collection of backgrounds and control samples we estimate that 3 days of VSANS time is required for these experiments We also recognize that this is an ambitious experiment but we believe it is feasible and need to perform these initial tests to identify the appropriate experimental protocols that should be followed to measure transport rates of molecules across dispersion interfaces using CV-SANS We have already demonstrated that we are capable of pushing the limits of the technique in our recent CV-SANS publications of oil-exchange in alkane emulsions References 1 Ameeduzzafar A et al Drug Deliv 23 710-726 2016 2 Vonarbourg A
