Title Magnetic structure and phase diagram of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 One of the current focus of condensed matter physics research is to find new materials where magnetism can tune the topological properties or vice versa Research over the past years mainly focused on the study of the non-centrosymmetric compounds where an anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya DM interaction leads to the formation of a topological magnetic texture such as skyrmion 1- Moving beyond the paradigm of the non-centrosymmetric skyrmion materials recent studies suggest that magnetic frustration is another route to search for the new topologically magnetic properties 5- To that end our recent measurements in conjunction with the earlier reports indicate that the kagome lattice antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 is a promising candidate to explore the interplay of magnetic and topological properties 8-1 To understand the role played by magnetism in the observed electromagnetic properties this proposal seeks to study the evolution of magnetic order in YMn6Sn6 as a function of field and temperature YMn6Sn6 crystallizes in a hexagonal space group P6mmm where the Mn-atoms form kagome layers stacked along the crystallographic c-axis 1 This geometrical arrangement of magnetic atoms favors strong magnetic frustration As expected previous small angle neutron scattering SANS measurements indicate that magnetism is two dimensional and magnetic frustration arises from a competition between helical and ferromagnetic order  Further neutron diffraction measurements show that YMn6Sn6 stabilizes in a helical structure formed by the rotation of Mn-atoms in the crystallographic ab-plane 1 However both neutron measurements were performed in the polycrystalline sample and a more extensive verification in the single crystal is essential Another interesting feature of YMn6Sn6 is the rich phase diagram formed by the complex interplay between different magnetic order  Magnetization measurements on single crystals show that the material undergoes multiple field-induced phase transitions indicating that the competing magnetic interactions are robust Fig 1a and Ref  At the base temperature of 3 K the magnetization vs field curve shows a jump near 2 T followed by kink near 68 T and 10 T  Interestingly the initial slope of the Hall resistivity is negative between 0 and 2 T and it decreases with an increasing magnetic field becomes minimum at 9T and increases with the field Fig 1b and Ref  The significant change of the Hall signal at 18 K both in magnitude and sign suggests that the Hall resistivity is strongly affected by the magnetic structure Our recent SANS measurements of YMn6Sn6 further demonstrate that the change in Hall effect is associated with a change in magnetic structure At zero field and base temperature of 4 K a magnetic Bragg peak is observed at Q  02 Fig 2a consistent with the structure described in Ref 1 As shown in the Fig 2b the intensity of the Bragg peak changes significantly near 2 T but the wave-vector does not change at this field Near 6 T there is a slight change in the wave-vector Fig 2b In addition we measured temperature dependence at the magnetic field of 7 T At higher temperatures an additional broad magnetic peak appears near Q  022 -1 which shifts towards another Bragg peak at Q  02 when the temperature is lowered Fig 2c Due to the limited range of the momentum transfer Q coverage of the SANS instrument the origin of the additional magnetic peaks at 7 T is not clearly understood Following up these measurements requires a triple-axis spectrometer which can extend these measurements to the higher range of momentum transfer and energy The preliminary SANS measurements together with the magnetization and Hall effect measurements show that YMn6Sn6 is an interesting system to study the interplay between the topological band features and magnetism To provide more insight into the origin of the Hall effect observed in YMn6Sn6 a complete understanding of the magnetic properties is essential To achieve these goals we propose two measurements 1 Neutron diffraction measurements to investigate the change in magnetic structure as a function of field and temperature 2 Inelastic neutron scattering measurements to measure the spin excitations of YMn6Sn6 the subsequent determination of the effective spin Hamiltonian at the ground state As a part of these goals this proposal seeks to understand the magnetic structure and its evolution as a function of temperature and magnetic field We have also submitted a related proposal for inelastic neutron scattering measurements for a more comprehensive understanding of the spin Hamiltonian giving rise to these interesting magnetic and electronic properties We will coordinate with the instrument team to carry out this experiment prior to the inelastic measurements For the determination of magnetic structure both longitudinal and transverse scans will be performed near the magnetic and the structural Bragg peaks We will utilize the position sensitive detector PSD of BT7 to increase the efficiency of the measurements Field dependence of magnetic structure will be measured by scanning the magnetic Bragg peaks as a function of field and temperature From our SANS measurement we expect that the change in magnetic wave-vector with the field is small and hence a high-resolution diffractometer is essential to carry out the measurements Due to the necessity of high Q-resolution and flux the triple axis instrument BT7 is an ideal instrument for the measurements With our experience of the instrument on similar systems we expect that four days of BT7 time will be enough for this measurement Note that the single crystal of YMn6Sn6 has been synthesized Fig 3 Figure 1 a Magnetization measurements showing dc susceptibility as a function of temperature and field b Magnetotransport measurements showing Hall resistivity as a function of field
