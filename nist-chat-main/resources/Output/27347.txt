Utilization of Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Techniques to Inform Microstructural-Aware Models of High Explosive Performance Introduction The performance and shock sensitivity of heterogeneous high explosives HEs are intimately connected to physical characteristics and processes that occur within the explosives microstructure at the nano- and micro-scale Utilizing results of ultra- and small-angle neutron scattering measurements USANS and SANS we have recently developed a Physics-informed Scaled Uniform Reactive Front SURF framework to link the microstructural processes at the nano- and micron scale to the practical continuum behavior of high explosives at the macroscale 1 Continued development of this microstructural-aware capability will allow unprecedented insight and predictive power for performance accident scenarios manufacturing variability and enable new HE development HEs detonate by facilitation of shock-induced energy localization generally known as hot spots Energy localization occurs primarily via physical-property disparities between the HE crystals and the void fraction The void fraction in a pressed charge generally comprises two components internal owing to various flaws within the crystals and interstitial associated with spaces between crystals in a pressed charge Both flaw types presumably affect shock sensitivity In a pressed charge reaction is not terribly sensitive to the exact void location ie whether a void is within or without a crystal but mainly to the overall near-field size distribution USANS and SANS methods can provide the information about the void structure of pressed charges that is necessary to inform microstructure-aware models Corner turning is an important measure of performance with respect to detonation propagation in TATB-based high explosives such as PBX 9502 Historical lot-to-lot variation of PBX 9502 performance is well known  though the cause has remained elusive To ensure that a sufficient source of high explosives is available to support the current and future stockpile the need to synthesize new lots of TATB is significant However recently manufactured lots of PBX 9502 exhibit a similar lot-to-lot variation in the enhanced corner turning ECOT test as historical lots Subtle changes in synthesis conditions among lots can alter TATB microstructural details and affect performance Information on particle surface area and the size and evolution of voids among lots of PBX 9502 is needed to incorporate into the SURF framework to predict performance in the ECOT test and thus understand the influence of these microstructural parameters on corner turning USANS and SANS techniques have the ability to probe the total porosity of pressed HEs and thus provide a quantitative measure of void size and morphology 4 void fraction and interfacial surface area  on the length scales that strongly affect the shock initiation transient The use of neutrons is imperative to these studies as they allow access to length scales necessary to more fully define the high explosive microstructure and the ability to through contrast variation probe internal voids in pre-pressed powders  Proposed Measurements USANS and SANS measurements will be performed on pre-pressed powders and pressed pellets of PBX 9502 and TATB at ambient temperature in order to characterize their void and interfacial structure We will study historical and newly synthesized lots of PBX 9502 and TATB with the intention of utilizing the microstructural information obtained to calibrate the SURF model to the known performance of the historical lots in the ECOT test In this way SURF can be utilized to predict the corner turning ability of new HE lots based upon their microstructural characteristics The information will be utilized to improve TATB synthesis and PBX 9502 formulation operations to ensure uniform performance and reliability across material lots Each lot of material will be studied in pre-pressed molding powder and pressed 1892 gcc forms Molding powders will arrive in sealed vials and will only be opened to add the requisite amount of fluid to facilitate contrast variation measurements By dispersing the molding powder in a compatible fluid such as toluene and then systematically varying the deuterated fraction of the solvent we can effectively highlight the scattering from the crystalline surface or the internal void structure  This will allow characterization of the pre-pressed void size distribution and later correlation with the final void distribution of the pressed part Between three and five contrasts will be studied for each powder Pressed samples will be in the form of disks  10 mm thick and 95 mm in diameter Approximately 45 samples will be studied with SANS and 25 samples with USANS Data Analysis Detailed modeling of the measured scattering functions will be performed in order to quantify the results Structural models including simple shapes spheres ellipsoids etc will be utilized as dictated by the data IQ  2V fR VR2PQ R0dR 1 Here  is the void volume fraction  is the scattering length density contrast VR is the void volume PQR is the void form factor and fR is the probability density of finding a void with a radius between R and dR The maximum entropy technique or the assumption of an analytic form log-normal Gaussian etc will be utilized to determine fR The surface area Sv will be determined by analysis of the high-Q slope Q R of the scattering curves according to Porods law IQ  22SvQ4  2 Parameters such as void size distribution void volume fraction and surface area will be utilized within SURF For contrast variation studies the scattering intensity can be expressed as a quadratic in the contrast  s thus IQ  2IQ  IQ  IQ The functions IQ IQand IQ arise respectively from the shape of the solvent-excluding parts of the structure r and the scattering from the internal scattering length density fluctuations r The last function is the scattering due to correlations between r and r In an experiment data is collected as a function of  and Q The resulting curves are then fit to the above expression at each value of Q and the three scattering functions determined Safety Considerations TATB and PBX 9502 are insensitive high explosives IHEs There is no threat of detonation of these materials if they fall under their own weight and no threat of detonation or deflagration under the proposed experimental conditions The safe handling of high explosives is well documented and the experimenters are experienced in working with high explosives Neutron scattering measurements have been performed on various HE systems including TATB and PBX 9502 over the past 20 years without incident We have found no evidence of sample activation or degradation as a result of exposure to an intense neutron beam wavelengths from 2 - 15 Angstroms References 1 Perry W L Clements B Ma X Mang J T Relating microstructure
