SANS Investigation of Cation- and Anion-Functionalized Nanoporous Silica Membranes Introduction The State of California has experienced annual snowpack depletion and persistent drought that is impacting agriculture industry and day-to-day life They are not alone as many parts of the world face a freshwater crisis Interestingly California for example has 38 times more brackish water than fresh water Electrodialysis ED is known to be one of the most energy efficient technologies for purification of brackish water utilizing an applied potential to selectively draw cations and anions across paired ion selective membranes as seen in Figure 1 Yet ED is not typically considered as a leading solution to the freshwater crisis in part due to the cost and performance of polymer ion exchange membranes IEMs IEMs suffer from high cost high ionic resistance poor durability aqueous swelling and other problems This work focuses on addressing these issues with a new IEM technology based on mechanically supported self-assembled nanoporous silica with covalently bound cationic or anionic moieties Silica is an advantageous material for membranes because of its excellent durability extremely low cost and lack of swelling in water Here adjusting sol-gel self-assembly kinetics allows for tunable nanoporous structures that can be engineered to achieve size exclusion ie sub-5 nm pores while surface functionalization ie silane chemistry is utilized to achieve anion- and cation-selective performance We have optimized ED-specific membrane performance attributes such as ion permselectivity and water permeance to be superior to industry standard Neosepta while ion conductivity still has room for improvement In brackish water conditions our techno-economic model indicates that silica-based membranes could reduce the levelized cost of water LCOW by up to 30 making ED cost competitive with reverse osmosis and enabling an energy efficient solution to the freshwater crisis Preliminary Data We have characterized the nanostructure of cation- and anion-functionalized membrane chemistries utilizing small angle X-ray scattering SAXS Figure 2 shows SAXS profiles of cation exchange membranes self-assembled with different loadings of sulfonic acid functional groups and fit with the Teubner-Strey model Fitting results show an increase in pore radius and decrease in inter-pore correlation length with increasing sulfonic acid loading These results correlate with improved sodium ion conductivity and cation permselectivity which are key performance indicators for electrodialysis Figure 1 Diagram of electrodialysis removing NaCl from solution using paired cation and anion exchange membranes Figure 2 SAXS profiles of nanoporous silica with SO3- functional groups at different molar loadings Solid lines represent fits with the Teubner-Strey model Diagram of an electrodialysis cell pair removing NaCl from solution However a SAXS invariant analysis shows anywhere between an 85 - 52 reduction in porosity over the same sulfonic acid loading range depending on scattering length density SLD assumptions Typically porosity and transport properties are correlated so this inverse correlation is surprising Fundamentally our analysis of porosity-property relationships is intrinsically limited by our lack of information about the location and structure of the functional group relative to the location and structure of the nanopore Figure 3 highlights three different possibilities that could generate similar SAXS profiles Figure 3a shows a cationic functional group filling a pore and resulting in an X-ray SLD contrast between the functional group 9010-6 -2 and silica 18910-6 -2 Figure 3b shows a core-shell structure where the core is filled with air and the shell is the functional group but the resultant SAXS profile differences between Figures 3a and 3b would be minimal if the pores are similar in size Figure 3c shows the possibility that the functional group is phase segregated outside the pores but in this case the scattering contrast between the functional group and silica is much less than silica and air Understanding and optimizing ion transport in functionalized ceramic membranes requires detailed information that cannot be determined from SAXS or electron microscopy Proposed Experiment In the proposed SANS study we will determine the location and structure of functional groups relative to the location and structure of nanopores within the silica matrix as seen in Figure 3 Initially the contrast match point will be determined for a non-functionalized ie silica only nanoporous structure by filling the nanopores with H2OD2O mixtures The SLD of amorphous silica is  34810-6 -2 and so the match point is anticipated to be  42 vol H2O Cationic ie sulfonic acid and anionic ie quaternary ammonium functionalized membranes with different functional group loadings 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 mol will then be run at the amorphous silica contrast match point effectively leaving only the contrast between the hydrated silica matrix SLD  34810-6 -2 and the functional groups cation SLD  08810-6 -2 and anion SLD  -08110-6 -2 Preliminary SAXS data Figure 2 has shown increasing pore diameter with increasing functional group loading which suggests that functional moieties are phase segregated in the nanopore structure When amorphous silica is contrast matched to the liquid phase this functional group structure might appear as spheres or hollow core-shell spheres which could be determined through fitting of appropriate scattering models However it is unlikely that the complex structure could be perfectly Figure 3 Illustrations of nanopores white in a silica matrix grey with functional groups red a Nanopores filled with functional groups b Functional groups in a core-shell structure c Functional groups located outside the pores described by either of these models and therefore we also plan to contrast match the functional group to gain additional information The contrast match points of the functional groups will be determined for samples at high loadings ie 40 mol The match point for the cation functional group should be  79 vol H2O whereas the match point for the anion functional group is slightly lower than H2O This small difference in SLD is not likely to impact the desired outcome given the large SLD difference between H2O and amorphous silica Contrast matching to the functional groups should provide information about the size of the silica nanopore independent of the functional group Scattering profiles for both contrast matching experiments will be fit with appropriate sphere-based structural models or generalized models eg Teubner-Strey If model fitting is not possible we will utilize a more general relationship eg Porod analysis invariant etc to extract structural information Ultimately detailed structural information will be compared against performance data and utilized to understand ion transport mechanisms for this new type of ion exchange membrane This information will provide critical insights for optimizing the performance of ultra-low-cost ion exchange membranes with the potential to reduce the cost of brackish water purification by up to 30 Experimental Details A total of 17 amorphous silica membrane samples 8 cation-functionalized 8 anion-functionalized and 1 non-functionalized will be run and can be synthesized with a 2-week notice We anticipate that contrast matching of amorphous silica and the 40 mol cation functional group samples will require 5 measurement each 10 total Pure H2O will be utilized as the contrast match point for anion functional groups Then each sample will be run at 2 contrast match points This leads to a total of 42 measurements All samples will be run at 25 C and a q-range of 0001 -1 to 10 -1 will be measured to capture the typical pore size eg 05 - 20 nm Based on prior SANS experiments on silica membranes performed in 2016 we anticipate each sample measurements to take 30 minutes with certain functional loadings and contrasts taking a longer or shorter amount of time The total SANS beam time request for this proposal is 24 hours We note that the most challenging attribute of this experiment is removal of air from the nanoporous structure Silica is hydrophilic and the high ion conductivity would suggest nanopore wetting should not be a problem To further ensure nanopore wetting we anticipate pulling vacuum on the demountable cells after membranes are loaded If air is not fully evacuated from the nanopores this will be easily determined during the first 1-2 hours of contrast matching for amorphous silica In this case we would switch to a high pressure cell with deuterated methane which was recently shown to be successful for contrast matching of nanoporous materials In this approach we could reach a d-methane SLD of 310-6 -2 which is similar to the match point of amorphous silica In this scenario the high-q would be limited to 03 -1 but this should be sufficient to extract information for low-loading formulations and could achieve the final intended result of this proposal Due to the timing of this scenario we would measure fewer total samplesformulations To prepare for this back-up plan in parallel we will follow the sample preparation procedure described by Chiang et al References  -
