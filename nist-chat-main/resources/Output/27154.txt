Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg MD 20899 Scientific background and anticipated impact The inclusion of nanoparticles to polymer matrix strongly modifies the mechanical optical and transport properties of the polymer nanocomposites PNCs1-3 Among all the most intriguing and important property is the mechanical reinforcement of PNCs3 In comparison to the significant progresses on the understanding of the mechanical reinforcement of PNCs in the linear response region4 5 the origin of the high mechanical strength of PNCs at large deformation the nonlinear region remains a controversial topic Generally it is accepted that PNCs are composed of two types of networks the polymer matrix network and the nanoparticle network Both networks contribute to the stress of PNCs However the deformation of polymer network and the nanoparticle network are strongly coupled and it is not clear which one dominates the stress Historically the hydrodynamic reinforcement acknowledging the local strain and strain rate amplification of the polymer matrix had been employed to explain the mechanical reinforcement of the PNCs at large deformation which had been verified by small-angle neutron scattering SANS6 Clearly the hydrodynamic reinforcement idea emphasized on the deformation of polymer matrix However recent SANS experiments on deforming PNCs showed an absence of the strain field amplification of the polymer matrix and the authors concluded the nanoparticle-nanoparticle network dominated the stress of PNCs7 The discrepancies between different experiments emphasized strongly on the demanding of a robust methodology to decouple and quantify the polymer matrix stress P as well as the stress contribution of nanoparticles NP in deformed PNCs Recently the two-dimensional SANS 2D-SANS spectra of neat polymers has been analyzed by spherical harmonic expansion SHE for details see the figure caption of Figure 1 and Ref8 9 A detailed analysis showed that the macroscopic polymer stress only depends on the expansion coefficient 5F205D of the second spherical function 5L205 in uniaxial extension P  k5F205D with k a pre-factor Therefore the SHE analysis offers a potential way to connect the microscopic polymer conformations with their corresponding macroscopic stress Extending the SHE technique to PNCs introduces several complications10 55C5A565D

obtained The current project aims to extend the SHE analysis to PNCs for clarifying the confusion in the literature on the mechanical reinforcement of PNCs at large deformation and for unraveling the origin of the strain-hardening of PNCs Justification of the usage of the neutron scattering The deformation of polymer network and the nanoparticle network are strongly coupled in PNCs and it is very challenging to separate out their individual contributions So far neutron scattering is the only available technique that allows a direct quantification on the polymer deformation at different length scales Experimental design and the choice of the instrument We use model poly2-vinyl pyridine P2VPSiO2 nanocomposites where the SiO2 nanoparticles can disperse well in P2VP Fig 2 The SiO2 nanoparticles with RNP  10 nm will be synthesized by a modified Stbers method at the MSU lab Monodispersed pronated-P2VP H7-P2VP and partially deuterated-P2VP D3-P2VP are commercially available from scientific products and polymer sources A protondeuterium HD ratio of 071029 in the P2VP matrix will be applied to obtain zero contrast matching between the polymer matrix and SiO2 nanoparticles We focus on three types of samples the pure polymer matrix NP  0 reference two PNCs with NP  7 vol and NP  17 vol According to the preliminary results Fig 2 the 7 vol nanocomposite doesnt have nanoparticle network and the 17 vol one is dominated by the nanoparticle network For each set of samples six elongation ratios of   10 isotropic sample 20 30 50 70 and 100 at a constant Hencky strain
