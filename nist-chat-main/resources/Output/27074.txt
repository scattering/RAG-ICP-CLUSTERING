Determination of the magnetic structure of the intermetallic compound CeCuBi175Sb025 Series of cerium based intermetallic compounds are of great interest to the condensed matter physics community due to their rich playground and complex phase diagrams generate by the interplay between Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida RKKY magnetic interaction Crystalline Electrical Field CEF and Kondo effects This interplay often provides some interesting non-trivial ground states in these Ce-based materials such as heavy-fermion HF properties unconventional superconductivity UCS and non-Fermi-liquid behavior that frequently appear in the vicinity of a magnetically ordered state  Interestingly some of these properties such as the concomitant observation of USC and HF behavior that defines a heavy-fermion superconductor seem to be favored to occur in low symmetry systems such as families of compounds with tetragonal structure Well-known examples of the related tetragonal structures that hold Ce-based heavy fermions superconductors are the families of CeMIn5 Ce2MIn8 M  Co Rh Ir Pd CePt2In7  and CeCu2Si2  The combination of the above fundamental properties is what motivates us to further investigated novel series of Ce-based intermetallic compounds in tetragonal structures In this context recent attention was given to the CeTX2 family T  transition metal X  pnictogen that host both ferromagnetic FM and antiferromagnetic AFM members with complex magnetic behavior such as CeNi AgSb2  In particular we have proposed to investigate the series of compounds CeCuBi2-xSbx that crystallizes in the tetragonal ZrCuSi2-type structure P4nmm  space group with lattice parameters given by a  4551   - 4351  and c  97778   - 10051  for 0  x  2 and with a stacking arrangement of CeBiSb-Cu-CeBiSb-BiSb layers Our previous characterization revealed these compounds ordering as AFM at Nel temperatures of TN  16 K  37 K 39 K 41 K 56 K respectively for CeCuBi2 CeCuBi175Sb025 CeCuBi14Sb06 CeCuBiSb and CeCuSb2 The CeCuBi2 compound has a large magnetic anisotropy Figure 1a- black diamonds with a ratio 5  5  45 at TN The magnetic anisotropy reduces as we increase the amount of Sb in the compound until the easy magnetization axis changes from the c-axis to the ab-plane for x  06 Figure 1a - blue triangles suggesting a strong effect of Sb substitution in the CEF parameters Furthermore for Sb concentration of x  025 we observe that the ratio 5  5 is 11 at TN Figure 1a - red circles showing a quasi isotropic magnetic susceptibility that interestingly indicates a CEF scheme similar with a cubic symmetry even though the crystal structure is tetragonal Indeed that is what we have found from fits to the magnetic susceptibility measurements using a mean-field theory model with the influence of anisotropic first-neighbors interaction and tetragonal CEF Hamiltonian  Figure 1 b and c show some of these fits The CEF scheme obtained was a doublet 7 on the ground state and two doublets 6 and 7 as first and second excited state respectively separated by 5 K of each other and 15 K of the ground state therefore these two last doublets are probably forming an effective quartet 8 as a first excited state For this reason the CeCuBi175Sb025 is a possible compound to present a multipolar quantum criticality MQC which is an emergent phenomena little explored in the literature due to the lack of compounds with these characteristics Figure 1 a Magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature with magnetic field applied parallel  and perpendicular  to the c-axis for some compounds of the series CeCuBi2-xSbx The best fits of the magnetic susceptibility using the CEF mean field model discussed in the text are presented in for x  0 b extracted of Ref  and for x  025 c Usually compounds with cubic symmetry have a duplet as the ground state with splitting energy bigger than 50 K of the quartet on the first excited state For this reason even on these compounds the multipolar quantum criticality is not easily found In some very rare cases as on the antiferromagnetic CeT2Ge2 T  Ag and Cu TN  41 K and 46 K respectively we can find a tetragonal crystalline structure with an effective quartet as an accessible state 7 8  Specifically for the CeAg2Ge2 compound we notice an effective quartet on the ground state with splitting energy of 130 K  while the CeCu2Ge2 we observe an effective quartet on the first excited state with splitting energy of 191 K  Therefore both compounds present magnetic anisotropy precisely with the easy magnetic direction along the c-axis for the CeCu2Ge2 and along the ab-plane for CeAg2Ge2 The CeAg2Ge2 compound has a magnetic structure with an incommensurate propagation vector q of 00 0295 111 with the Ce moments lying on the ab-plane forming a modulated spin density wave SDW  Whereas CeCu2Ge2 compound has a q of 02850285054 with the Ce moments forming on the ab-plane a spiral SDW SSDW  Besides that this compound presents an USC state with a critical temperature of 064 K under 10 GPa of applied pressure  As such since the CeCuBi175Sb025 compound shows an isotropic magnetic susceptibility suggesting a quasi-cubic CEF symmetry around the Ce3 ion which provides an effective quartet on the CEF scheme that can lead to a MQC it is extremely important to solve the magnetic structure for this compound to learn to details about the magnetic interaction in this compound and to search for complex spin modulated and possibly multi-Q phases Therefore we propose the realization of neutron magnetic diffraction experiment on single crystals of approximately 100 mg at the BT-7 beamline to obtain the magnetic structure of this interesting compound To solve the magnetic structure of this compound that is completely unknown we request 7 days of beamtime at BT-7  PColeman et al J Phys Condens Matter R723-R738 2001   J D Thompson and Z Fisk J Phys Soc Japan 81 011002 2012  F Steglich et al Phys Rev Lett 43 1892 1979  A Thamizhavel et al Phys Rev B 68 054427 2003  C Adriano et al Phys Rev B 90 235120 2014  P J G Pagliuso et al J of Applied Phys 99 08P703 2006  D K Singh et al Phys Rev B 84 052401 2011  G Knopp et al Z Phys B -
