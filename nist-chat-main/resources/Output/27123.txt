Polarized Neutron Tomography of Room Temperature Skyrmion Lattice Melissa Henderson Benjamin Heacock Dusan Sarenac Dmitry Pushin November 11 2019 Introduction Topologically non trivial spin textures in particular magnetic skyrmions host great promise for future logic elements and high density memory devicesowing to their mobility via ultra low current densities and quasiparticle like behaviour Current probing techniques are heavily biased towards surface level microscopy measurements such as Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy unfortunately leaving discontinuities in our knowledge of their behaviournamely in the bulk Even moreso polarized neutron experiments which provide a direct means of mapping out the magnetization direction are rarely performed if only to obtain the direction of chirality Yet the combination of bulk probing techniques and polarization based measurements host great potential to reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for topological transitions evolution of defects and skyrmion tube interactions beyond the surface It has remained a highly non-trivial issue as to how the conservation of skyrmion charge which gives rise to its topological protection is compatible with lattice form changes and transitions to topologically trivial magnetic states It has previously been reported in  via magnetic force microscopy in the metastable SkS-X phase in that the destruction of the skyrmions latticestransitioning from the skyrmion toe Co SiF 1x x helimagnetic statewas achieved via coalescing of skyrmions to form line-like structures A forking phenomena was stipulated to be the annihilation mechanism responsible  wherein two ingoing skyrmions merge or a single ingoing skyrmion line splits in two creating monopoles and antimonopoles respectively which then zip through to the surface or through the bulk Similar forking phenomena has also been proposed in  and  as a topological unwinding phenomena in the current-induced depinning of originally segmented skyrmion strings magnetic monopole-antimonopole pairs and a destruction mechanism between pinned and moving skyrmions 2 Moreover exotic behaviour such as twisted surface skyrmions in the bulk wherein skyrmions change from pure Neel to pure Bloch twisting  has been detected using polarized resonant elastic x-ray scattering by exploiting the circular dichroism We have synthesized a room temperature polycrystalline intermetallic skyrmion previouslyo Zn MnC 8 8 4 reported in  of dimensions 34 mm x 33 mm x 30 mm The helical and skyrmion phases were verified via SANS measurements at room temperature in zero field and at 310 K in a field of 250 G Although the initial skyrmion phase SANS pattern was a ring indicative of multiple-q domain structures fig1 a using a method described in  upon rotating the sample in the static magnetic field configuration about the vertical axis qy direction the characteristic sixfold symmetric SANS pattern emerged with a novel secondary scattering ring fig1 We then performed a tomography technique outlined in  which consisted of measuring neutron diffraction spectra as a function of sample rotation This data in combination with a phase retrieval algorithm followed by a tomographic reconstruction has been used to generate a scattering length density map of the skyrmion which provides novel insight into the bulk structures and interactions of these skyrmion tubes Figure 1 Two dimensional slices of scattering length density map at three different angles showing potential forking of skyrmion tubes Ten minute count times were used for each 02 degree increment Based off the three dimensional reconstruction it appears as though the skyrmions form tubes which penetrate the sample to a depth on the micrometer scale Moreover there appears to be some exotic behavior such as skyrmion tubes forking which could be attributed to the dynamic symmetry-breaking domain alignment procedure pre-existing topological defects unwind upon rotation in the magnetic field andor moving skyrmions which follow the field intersect pinned skyrmionsdefects mergingannihilating via spin hedgehogs Performing tomographic polarization analysis would provide unique insight into the physical processes underlying this forking behaviour and topological transitions between discrete topological states and will allow for a novel form of bulk measurements which has the ability to reveal exotic phenomena such as skyrmion twisting in the bulk In particular having the incident neutron polarization parallel to the neutron propagation direction z and performing analysis in the post-selected perpendicular polarization directions xy allows us to directly obtain information on the helicity of these tubes as the penetrate the bulk of the material in the z direction with the magnetization rotating in the xy plane Additionally it would determine the spin texture of these forked objects and therefore reveal the physical phenomena causing them We previously attempted our first polarized VSANS experiment for this material from October 7th-10th at CHRNS VSANS with the same polarization setup described above This was achieved using a pi2 spin flipper placed before the analyzer which flipped the scattered neutrons polarization into the transverse xyplanereminiscent of transverse polarimetry Due to the required sample field of 5 G needed to maintain the skyrmion phase Wangchun Chen designed a special pi2 spin flipper that reduced the sample field at the flippers location so as to maximize phase contrast The transverse polarimetry approach was tested at PHADES using a pi2 spin flipper to mimic the skyrmion sample It was determined that for a sample field of 5 G there is 89 contrast at PHADES however only 63 contrast on VSANS owing to the larger wavelength spread Whilst performing the experiment anomalous scattering from the pi2 spin flipper which assumed a 4-fold peak pattern overwhelmed the signal at all diffraction ordersthe source was unfortunately not determined until the end of the experiment Without reference scans of the pi2 spin flipper at different angles and count times data analysis becomes limited Moreover feasibility issues of the experimental setup limited the ability to minimize the distance between the pi2 spin flipper and the sample to 10cm Experiment We propose a polarized VSANS experiment with the same transverse polarimetry approach described above The distance between the pi2 spin flipper and sample can be minimized to the order of a few centimeters in order to minimize the neutron precession region and therefore spin dephasing and ultimately loss of information Moreover it was determined that the sample field can be reduced to 0 G in a different metastable phase at 170 K without destroying the skyrmion phasewe will be able to achieve significantly better phase contrast Ultimately our new setup configured with the sample environment team will overcome our previous limitations and feasibility issues With this new setup we will examine the spin-dependant momentum correlations of the skyrmion phase before and after the skyrmion domain alignment rotation sequence of  to determine the underlying mechanism responsible for the forking behaviour In particular we will post-select perpendicular polarization directions to investigate any changes in the intensity of the peaks in the hexagonal patternmirrored in the reverse polarization directionso as to observe the chirality of the skyrmion lattices and any additional helicity changes owing to topological transitions through the bulk of the skyrmion tubes andor presence of topological defects We will begin polarization analysis in the perpendicular plane beginning with the Px  09  and -Px  directions and Py  and -Py  directions along with some intermediate directions70 2  0 80 1   We will then perform the tomography technique as a function of the polarization analysis direction45  315    to investigate the bulk skyrmion behaviour We will perform these measurements at a wavelength of in a6 reciprocal space range of  For the tomography measurements we require 10 minutes at each one0058 0 1 degree increment over a 30 degree angular range totaling 5 hours for each analysis polarization directionWe therefore request a total of 5 days beam time on CHRNS NG3 VSANS Time Requested  1 day for feasibility setup and pi2 spin flipper optimization  5 hours for field cooling into the correct skyrmion phase at 170 K  6x2 hours for measuring post-selected perpendicular
