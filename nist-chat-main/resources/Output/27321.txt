Effects of Surface Tension and Viscosity of Fluid on Water Evaporation from Porous Media Saiqi Zeng Wenjuan Zheng and Yan Jin Plant and Soil Sciences University of Delaware Newark DE 1 General goal of the project Evaporation consumes nearly 25 of the input solar energy and is a significant process in global water cycling Trenberth et al 2009 Evaporation from porous media eg soil is a significant pathway of global evaporation Approximately 60 of terrestrial precipitation either by direct soil evaporation 20 or through plant transpiration 40 is returned through evaporation Oki and Kanae 2006 Evaporation from porous media shows highly dynamic changes in rates that reflect the changes of dominant mechanisms during evaporation and is typically controlled by 1 the rates of energy supply for the phase change from liquid to vapor 2 the constraints on internal supply of water to the vaporization plane and 3 the rate of water vapor moves from porous medium into the atmosphere through partially dry porous medium and across the air boundary layer above the evaporative surfaces Or et al 2012 Water evaporation from a soil is often separated into two stages - an initially high and relatively constant rate stage Stage I followed by a lower and gradually dropping rate stage Stage II The key mechanism that controls Stage I evaporation is internal capillary flow while the diffusion-limited vapor transport dominates the Stage II evaporation Previous studies had developed conceptual models to describe soil water evaporation from over-simplified models eg use a bundle of cylindrical capillaries to represent medium pore space to more comprehensive models eg treating soil pores as angular All of these models consider surface tension and viscosity as important parameters for Stage I and Stage II evaporation but careful experimentation on the effects of surface tension and viscosity either individually or collectively which is a prevalent scenario in agricultural soil is lacking Neutron radiographytomography NRNT are powerful imaging techniques for studying water transport and distribution due to of their strong attenuation by hydrogen in water and relative insensitivity to both the gas phase and solid constituents such as silica The aim of the project is to visualize in situ water distribution and movement in packed columns and to reveal detailed information on evaporation and dynamics of water flow Our goal is to advance the mechanistic understanding of hydrogel increase viscosity and surfactant reduce surface tension mediated changes in porous media that controls water evaporation Such knowledge will improve our understanding of how microbial extracellular polymeric substances EPS and plant mucilage alter the biophysical properties of the rhizosphere 2 Related work and preliminary results Our previous work revealed that microbes could reduce soil evaporation presumably due to the production of extracellular polymeric substances EPS EPS is a mixture of many substances including mainly polysaccharides and proteins which have similar properties and functions of both surfactants and hydrogels that change surface tension and viscosity respectively Thus it was not possible to gain a thorough understanding on the effects of EPS on soil physical and hydrological properties without being able to differentiate the effects of surface tension and viscosity Effects of EPS production on soil column dry-out A preliminary test using neutron radiography to study soil evaporation was conducted at NIST A pure sand 4050- sieve size Unimin Corp Le Sueur MN and a sandy soil Georgetown DE were incubated with bacteria Bacillus S commercial named as UD1022 The control and treated soil samples were packed in aluminum sample cells Four samples were imaged simultaneously using the NIST BT-2 Thermal Neutron Imaging Facility The field of view was768 mm by 648 mm with a pixel size of 30 mm 60 mm resolution Experiment lasted for 11hr with images captured at an interval of 5 min The images in Fig 1 show reduced evaporation and increased water retention in UD1022-treated samples Neutron and X-ray Tomography images We imaged UD1022-treated and control sand samples using X-ray XRT and neutron tomography NT While XRT images Fig2 X-C1 X-C2 X-T1 X-T2 provide clear soil structure information more accurate water distribution can be obtained from neutron tomography images in Fig 2 N-C1 N-C2 N-T1 N-T2 The water content estimated from the 3D XRT and NT images were calculated by setting optimal thresholds to reconstructed image volumes Table 1 shows water content calculated from weight measurement and estimated water content from NT and XRT images Table 1 shows the differences in water content between the estimated values from XRT and NT images and weight measurement which can be explained by changes in water distribution due to UD1022 effects and the different resolutions of the imaging techniques The key finding from these results is that water distribution is more heterogeneous in the treated samples compared to the controls Table 1 Volumetric water content of each sample calculated from different

The first one is using neutron radiography to image water evaporation process from control hydrogel- surfactant- and hydrogel  surfactant-treated HS sand samples the second one is to image Figure 1

water content and low  9 vv water content water content using the combined NTXRT technique Due to the difficulties to separate different components from EPS we plan to use pure chemical analogs to mediate porous media properties pure sand in this experiment to understand the effects of surface tension and viscosity on evaporation Sample preparation The pure sand for this experiment will be Accusand sand 4050-sieve size Unimin Corp Le Sueur MN The sand will be acid-washed and autoclaved so that metal residue and microbes can be eliminated For hydrogel treated sand 1 ww xanthan an EPS analog that had been widely used in other studies Rosenzweig el al 2012 will be added into pure sand All treatments will be mixed with 5 ww water and carefully packed into custom-made aluminum columns with diameter of 1 cm and length of 2 cm to avoid layering and bubble trapping Hydrogel and control samples will be saturated in degassed DI water overnight to allow fully saturation before imaging Following the same procedure surfactant treated and HS treated samples will be prepared in degassed DI water with 1 xanthan for HS treated sample and saturated in 25mgL surfactin solution Surfactin is lipopeptide produced by majority of B subtlis that function similarly as surfactants Mnif and Ghribi 2015 Imaging Process The pre-saturated sand columns will be taken to NIST for imaging The columns will be placed in a flow chamber where the temperature humidity and air flow rate are monitored For neutron radiography imaging all samples are fully saturated and will be placed under ambient conditions and evaporate for 12 h For neutron and X-ray tomography imaging all samples will allow evaporation for a certain period of time to reach 25 and 9 vv water content determined by weight measurement of each sample before imaging Then a 12 h scan using NTXRT will be done with each sample The total time required for one experiment is estimated to be 108 h 12 h neutron radiography 12 h NTXRT for 4 samples at 2 water contents We would like to replicate the experiment which would require another 108 h Publication Wenjuan Zheng Saiqi Zeng Harsh Bais Jacob LaManna David Jacobson Daniel
