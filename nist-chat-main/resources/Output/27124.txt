 Title Domain-Wall-Superconductivity in NbFePd with lateral inhomogeneous magnetization probed by GISANS with polarization analysis Scientific Background Proximity effects on superconducting Sferromagnetic F systems gained large interest in the past decades Especially ferromagnets comprising inhomogeneous magnetization show enhanced critical Josephson currents and long-ranged triplet Cooper pairs  Magnetic domains and walls can guide the vortices and spatially confine the superconductivity in an adjacent superconducting layer  Despite the fact that these proximity effects have been extensively examined depth dependent studies on the magnetic fluctuations due to onset of superconductivity are yet to be scrutinized We propose to investigate the depth-resolved lateral magnetic fluctuations in NbFePd heterostructures GISANS with polarization analysis provides the possibility to probe the impact of the superconducting state on the amplitude and orientation of the magnetic fluctuations On the way to this study we have performed several experiments to characterize the magnetic behaviour of a laterally confined superconducting state in proximity to a ferromagnet Preliminary work This proposal is a follow-up to GISANS measurements performed on vSANS in September 2019 We have investigated NbFePd L10-phase heterostructures grown in a MBE system Due to the nature of the L10-phase in the ferromagnetic FePd layer the samples contain a magnetic domain structure with easy magnetization axis perpendicular to the sample surfaces The investigated samples show the existence of domain and domain-wall superconductivity near Tc  In zero applied field the stray fields of the underlying FePd layer penetrating into the Nb layer have a minimum over the domain walls Hence in zero applied field and near Tc superconductivity will nucleate over the domain walls DWS In an external magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface this subsequently changes to domain-superconductivity with a minimum in resistivity where the external applied magnetic field is applied in the reverse direction to the stray fields of the magnetic domains in FePd 113mT RDS At lower temperatures the second critical field Hc2T increases and the stray fields of the ferromagnet can no longer destroy the superconducting state so the Nb layer is in a homogeneous superconducting state First test-measurements were performed with an unpolarized beam from 88K-65K in zero field to probe the DWS in the samples see figure 1 Both the intensities of the specular spot and the GISANS peaks are observed to be increasing with decreasing temperature Earlier unpolarized GISANS measurements performed at KWS-3 in Garching Germany show a clear difference in the temperature dependencies of the specular spot and the GISANS peaks The intensity of the specular spot increased by lowering the temperature by the same percentage as in the measurements shown in figure 1 whereas the intensity of the GISANS peaks decreased see figure 2 For these measurements another sample with the same heterostructure and FePd in the L10-phase was used As can be seen in figure 2b a change in GISANS intensity happens in the temperature range of decreasing resistivity before a full superconducting state of the Nb layer is reached Figure 1 a Along Qz integrated intensity of the specular spot black and the GISANS peaks red as function of temperature b Qy-Qz-map of the unpolarized measurement at 88K in zero field and with a counting time of 1900s b a The striking differences in the temperature dependencies of the two measurements may originate from the high overlap of the specular spot and scattering from nuclear roughness with the GISANS peaks in figure 1b compared to figure 2c Based on the peak widths of the measurements with polarization analysis we have fit the contributions from specular spot GISANS peaks and an additional signal from nuclear roughness on the layers surfaces see figure 3 For the NSF-channels and the unpolarized measurements the scattering signal by nuclear roughness of the sample exceeds the intensity of the GISANS peaks so that they cannot be well resolved This changes for the SF-channel As the polarization efficiency for this measurement was 995 only 05 of nuclear intensity still fall into the specular spot and the GISANS peaks are well resolved We argue that the GISANS intensity in figure 1 is following the temperature dependence of the much more intense specular spot as both peaks are overlapping Therefore only scattering signals in the SF-channel can reveal changes of the magnetization vs temperature A comparison of measurements performed at 10K T  Tc and at 56K T  Tc are displayed in figure 4 The asymmetry of the right to Figure 2

a b the left GISANS peak is enhanced by lowering the temperature below Tc An asymmetry in the GISANS peak intensities may originate from an in-plane rotational chirality but still has to be scrutinized with simulations based on the DWBA 3 However due to the polarization of the neutron beam perpendicular to the sample surface the out-of-plane magnetic domains of the sample are probed in the NSF-channels whereas in-plane magnetic moments like closure domains are probed in the SF-channel For the used heterostructure the easy magnetization axis is out-of-plane Therefore we expect a higher change of magnetization vs temperature by passing the superconducting critical temperature for the out-of-plane magnetic domains Experiment Plan environment specifications and Q-range To be able to also resolve the temperature dependence of out-of-plane domains and their impact on the magnetization inside the Nb-layer we want to change to polarization orientation of the neutron beam compared to the last beamtime at NIST For the measurements performed in September we have used a polarization orientation perpendicular to the sample surface whereas in this proposal we also ask for a polarization state parallel to the sample surface Hence the out-of-plane magnetic domains will be probed in the SF-channel with better resolution of the GISANS-peaks to the specular spot and the signal from nuclear roughness We want to use the same setup as for the measurements shown in figure 1 The sample shall be mounted vertically the angle of incidence of the neutron beam will be near the angle of total reflection to observe the GISANS peaks We ask for a temperature range from 9K-5K and measure at 5 different temperatures in zero field-cooled mode small guiding field For this purpose we ask for the closed cycle refrigerator CCR The counting time shall be increased to 2h per channel and temperature compared to 1h for the previous measurement and the sample-to-detector distance shall be 12m so that the Qz-dependence of both the specular spot and the GISANS peaks is positioned on the middle carriage detectors with higher resolution than the front carriage detectors The desired Q-ranges are Qy  01 nm-1 and a Qz  0-05 nm-1 with a Q-resolution of 001 to 002 nm-1 The measurements shown in fig 4 were performed only at two temperatures 10 and 56 K Hence to have a more complete overview we would like to measure at 5 different temperatures with polarization perpendicular to the sample surface and polarization analysis Most importantly this will also provide a fully comparable study in both polarization orientations Furthermore the asymmetry of the two GISANS peaks shows a temperature dependence and might originate from the Nb-layer on the top of the heterostructure To be more sensitive to this first layer and to reduce the neutron penetration depth we would also like to measure at a second incident angle slightly smaller than the angle of total reflection Therefore for the proposed measurement we would like to request for 8 days of measurement time measuring at 5 temperatures  4 channels  2hrs counting time  2 polarization configurations  2 angles  160hrs 66 days plus one full day for sample mounting cooling to 9K and changing the magnet orientation in between the measurements The minimum needed measurement time will be 5 days for only one incident angle The data will be compared with simulations based on the DWBA 3 to investigate the lateral magnetic depth-profile of the sample In Reference  we already have shown non-polarized
