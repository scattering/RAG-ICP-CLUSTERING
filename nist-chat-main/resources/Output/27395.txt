1 Molecular Understanding of Anomalous Non-Universal Behavior in Highly Stretched Polymer Blends Yangyang Wang1 and Yun Liu2 1 Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences Oak Ridge National Laboratory Oak Ridge TN 37831 2 Center for Neutron Research National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg MD 20899 Introduction The rheological behavior of long-chain molecules is often characterized by great universality where the underlying physics is independent of the chemical details 1  For example the classical tube model for nonlinear entangled polymer rheology is built on a few simple parameters from linear viscoelasticity and considered applicable to both polymer melts and solutions However recent experiments have shown that entangled polymer solutions with nearly identical linear viscoelastic properties can exhibit rather different extensional behavior in the highly stretched state Fig 1 raising questions about the classical theories and prompting speculation about the effect of the nematic interactions  The goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular origin of such anomalous non-universal behavior in highly stretched polymer blends by using small-angle neutron scattering It is important to point out that stretching of polymer blends is often accompanied by viscoelastic phase separation 4- Because short chains exhibit much faster dynamics than the long chains they can diffuse under the stress generated by the long chains leading to large-scale concentration fluctuations in the deformed state  From the point of scattering experiments such a viscoelastic phase separation phenomenon produced the so-called butterfly patterns Therefore in this project we will characterize the deformed induced concentration fluctuation by small-angle neutron scattering and explore its connection to the observed anomalous non-universal behavior We hypothesize that demixing of components of different 55 will change the local friction environment giving rise to the observed non-universal behavior To test this idea we will focus on uniaxial extension of binary polymer blends consisting of long deuterated and short protonated chains Specifically we would like to address the following questions  To what a degree is the rheological response affected by deformation-induced concentration fluctuation  What is the relation between the non-universal behavior and the deformation-induced concentration fluctuation  Do the existing hydrodynamic theories capture the all essential features of the deformation-induced concentration fluctuation over a wide range of length scales To answer these questions we will quantitatively analyze the SANS spectra from deformed polymers by using the spherical harmonic expansion technique 9-1 Our recent preliminary results from the NGB-30 SANS beamline shows that this technical approach can be extended to decipher the anisotropic 2D SANS patterns from polymers where the scattering is dominated by deformation-induced concentration fluctuation Fig 2 Preliminary Results Rheological experiments To verify the results of Huang et al  we have carried out linear and nonlinear measurements on two polystyrene PS based blends solutions They are mixtures of long and short PS chains Fig 1 a Linear viscoelastic spectra of two polymer blends PS800K-1K and PS800K-35K at 140C b The LVE spectra in a are horizontally shifted to show that the two samples exhibit nearly identical entanglement dynamics The arrow indicates the equivalent frequency where the uniaxial stretching experiments in c are conducted c Stress-strain curves for the two blends at 120C 2 at volume fraction 5 5 The molecular weight of the long chain is approximately 800 kgmol whereas the molecular weights of the short chains are 10 and 35 kgmol respectively Fig 1 shows that the two polymer blends exhibit nearly identical entanglement dynamics when their difference in 5Gg is properly taken into consideration On the other hand they have very different nonlinear rheological responses when uniaxially stretched at the same Rouse Weissenberg number Such behavior cannot be rationalized within the classical theories SANS experiments We have carried out preliminary SANS studies of deformed isotopically-labeled binary polymer blends on the NGB-30 beamline at NCNR Fig 2 That system is similar to but not exactly the same as the blends proposed in this work It consists of 80 vol deuterated polystyrene PS of 850 kgmol and 20 vol protonated PS of 30 kgmol Ellipsoid patterns are observed when the stretching rate is much higher than the chain relaxation rate of both components On the other hand butterfly patterns appear when the stretching rate is lower than the chain Rouse relaxation rate of the short unentangled component due to the coupling between stress and concentration fluctuation Since we will use even shorter chains in this work we expect that we will observe butterfly patterns in all the proposed SANS experiments Materials and Methods Table 1 List of Samples for the Proposed SANS Study 5wL kgmol 5wS kgmol 5S Deformation conditions PS800K-1K 800 10 05 5H  2 25 5055E5F   PS800K-35K 800 35 05 5H  2 25 5055E5F   Materials We will investigate two polymer blends of different compositions for the proposed experimental study Table 1 The h-PS short chain and d-PS long chain will be mixed by first dissolving the polymers in toluene and then precipitating the mixture in methanol The final blend will be dried at high temperatures in a vacuum oven Dog-bone shaped specimens will be uniaxially stretched to various Hencky strains on an SER extensional fixture with a constant strain rate above the Tg and then immediately quenched into glassy state by pumping cold air into the Forced Convection Oven of the rheometer Two series of samples will be prepared by varying the stretching rate Table 1 Methods These quenched glassy specimens will be measured by SANS ie ex-situ measurements in the Q range of   5   1 The resulting 2D spectra will be collected and analyzed using the spherical harmonic expansion approach 9-1 to extract the microscopic information about the deformation induced anisotropy 55x  55Y5Z5D5L5Y5Z55Y5Z where 55x is the measured scattering intensity and 55Y5Z5D is the spherical harmonic expansion coefficient corresponding to each 5L5Y5Z5 This approach allows us to decompose the measured 2D scattering spectrum into components with different symmetry Because of the axial symmetry of the uniaxial extension problem all the 5Z  terms and the odd l terms are forbidden It follows that 55x  55Y05D5L5Y05 55Yeven with 5L5Y05 5 5Y5 25Y  5C5Ycos 5 More details about the data analysis procedure can be found in refs 5- The physical interpretation of such an expansion is that each coefficient 55Y05D represents the Q-dependent deformation anisotropy corresponding to the spherical harmonic Legendre function 5L5Y05 5  5005D represents the isotropic component whereas 5205D is the leading term of the anisotropic components Fig 2 Spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the SANS spectra from a polymer blend consisting of 80 vol d-PS850K and 20 vol h-PS30K stretched to 5 8 with a 50 55E5F 8 and b 50 55E5F  9 3 The feasibility of our sample preparation procedure and data analysis approach has been verified by our previous SANS experiment at NCNR 91 The measurement of the quenched glassy films does not require any special sample environment All the sample preparation work will be performed at ORNL Research Plan As stated above we propose to carry out an in-depth investigation of relation between the concentration fluctuation and non-universal rheological response in uniaxially stretched polymer blends by using small-angle neutron scattering Specifically we would like to examine the following questions a To what a degree is the rheological response affected by deformation-induced concentration fluctuation By using samples of different compositions and varying the stretching rate and Hencky strain we will map out a wide parameter space of the nonlinear rheological behavior In some cases we expect that the two blends exhibit the same level of stress while in others we expect them to be different On the other hand the deformation induced concentration fluctuations will be quantified by using the 2D SANS spectra through Q-dependent expansion coefficients 55Y5Z5D By putting the rheological and SANS data together we will be able to evaluate the influence of concentration fluctuations on stress response b What is the relation between the non-universal behavior and the deformation-induced concentration fluctuation Using the information from the aforementioned analysis we will further explore the possible connection between the non-universal behavior and the deformation-induced concentration fluctuation Notice that the long and short chains have very different glass transition temperatures Therefore deformation induced concentration fluctuations will likely cause a change in the local friction experienced by the long chains The non-universal extensional behavior will be analyzed along this line of reasoning based on the SANS and rheological data c Do the existing hydrodynamic theories capture the all essential features of this type of phenomenon Lastly we will critically examine the classical hydrodynamic theories 4 against the results from the SANS experiments to see if they can fully explain the deformed induced concentration fluctuations This analysis will also help us understand the molecular origin of the non-universal rheological response from these polymer blends Beam Time Request A total of approximately 12 samples will be measured Because these samples are highly stretched the sample width and thickness will be relatively small As a result a small sample aperture of 18 or 14 has to be used It is difficult to scale up the sample size due to the limitation of our stretching fixture According to our previous experience we estimate that a long measurement time of 6 hours is required for each sample to generate sufficiently good statistics for spherical harmonic expansion analysis of the 2D SANS data over a wide Q range using two configurations Therefore we would like to request 3 days of beam time for the NGB-30 or NG7 SANS instrument at
