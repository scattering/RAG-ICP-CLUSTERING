Exploring Spin Canting and Magnetic Anisotropy in Zn-dopedCo-Ferrite Shell  Magnetite Core Nanoparticles1 Background and Context Magnetic nanoparticles MNPs have numerous potential uses and amongthe most promising are biomedical applications that take advantage of hyperthermia produced by MNPsin alternating magnetic elds 1  The hyperthermia e cacy for MNPs in a colloidal suspension is oftenparameterized by the speci c loss power SLP Recently colleagues at the University of South Floridahave produced bi-magnetic NPs consisting of a Zn-doped Co-ferrite CoFe2O4 shell with high magneticanisotropy surrounding a magnetite Fe3O4 core  These coreshell MNPs provide a unique platformto vary the anisotropy coreshell ratio and NP size and shape to optimize the SLP By using polarizationanalyzed small angle neutron scattering PASANS we wish to understand at a fundamental level howZn-doping of the Co-ferrite shell a ects issues such as spin coupling of the core and shell as well as spindisorder across the MNPsThe spinel crystal lattice is common to both CoFe2O4 CFO and Fe3O4 so that the core and shellmaintain a common crystal structure as the nanoparticle grows leading to a high degree of uniformitybetween the core and shell In pure ZnFe2O4 ZFO which also adopts the spinel structure divalent andnon-magnetic Zn cations occupy both tetrahedral Td and octahedral Oh sites in the spinel lattice 4 5 In contrast Co2 cations have a high preference for Oh sites In the solid solution of Zn1 xCoxFe2O4ZCFO where x is the Co fraction Zn2 cations removed from the Td sites are replaced by Co2 ions onthe Oh sites causing some of the Fe3 cations to shift over to the Td sub-lattice thereby raising the overallmagnetization of the NP However the addition of the Co also a ects the magneto-crystalline anisotropywhich will a ect the spin disorder in the MNPsFig 1-a presents a transmission electron microscopy electron energy loss spectroscopy EELS map ofFe3O4 CoFe2O4 MNPs while Fig 1-b presents the EELS map at the center of the NP red trace and atthe shell blue While both EELS traces show strong signals from Fe the EELS collected at the center ofthe MNP does not show much of a contribution from the Co while the trace acquired at the shell shows asigni cant Co signal thereby con rming the Fe3O4 core  CoFe2O4 shell structure In Fig 1-c we presentthe size distributions determined by TEM for Fe3O4 Zn1 xCoxFe2O4 NPs where the Co content variesfrom x0 pure ZCFO to x10 pure CFO The data show that monodispersed MNPs with a meandiameter of 17 nm can be synthesized over a wide composition rangeBulk magnetometry measurements of the saturation magnetization Ms are presented in Fig 1-d whilethe anisotropy is displayed in Fig 1-e The magnetization generally shows a decrease as more Co is addedto the system although there is a peak at x  05 The e ective anisotropy Keff  is presented in Fig 1-eas well the calculated anisotropy of the core Kc which is assumed to be constant The shell anisotropytherefore appears to have a monotonic and linear increase as more Co is doped into the Zn-ferrite Thusby looking at compositions of x  025 and x  075 we can look at MNPs with similar Ms but wherethe ansotropy of the shell is expected to di er by a factor of 3 This large variation in anisotropy shouldhave a large e ect on the spin canting across the MNP 2 Previous Beam Time Allocation We were allocated beam time in Dec 2018 to conduct PASANSmeasurements on a closely related set of MNPs These consisted of Fe3O4 CoFe2O4 MNPs which areequivalent to the x  1 pure CFO samples as well as the reversed structure CoFe2O4  Fe3O4 Bothsets had a mean core diameter of 6 nm and shell thickness of 1-2 nm total MNP size 8-10 nm Thesamples had both interesting hysteresis loops and temperature-dependent magnetization We collecteddata at three temperatures 5 K 100 K  around the blocking temperature TBlock and 300 K and 5-7di erent magnetic eld protocols These were the rst PASANS measurements we conducted and since thebeam allocation we have been reducing the data sets calculating the relevant cross sections and magneticscattering pro les and modeling the dataSome of our results so far are presented in Figs 1-f and 1-g Fig 1-f presents the modulus square ofmagnetic scattering parallel to the applied eld jMjjj2 and perpendicular jMj2 to the eld acquirednear TBlock and at a eld 41 kG below the saturating eld value The data show a structural peak at 58 10 2 A 1 corresponding to the mean diameter of 11 nm as well as a large intensity di erence1in jMjjj2 red trace and jMj2 blue In Fig 1-f we present modeling of the nuclear scattering N2assuming a coreshell structure for our MNPs Black symbols are the data and the green line is the modelcalculation The gure shows good agreement between the measured N2 and the model We are continuingto work with NCNR physicists to re ne the structural and magnetic models of the Fe3O4 CoFe2O4 MNPsand the reversed structure x CoFe2O4  Fe3O4 CoFe2O4 and plan on writing a manuscript on the resultsearly in 20203 Proposed Experiment Samples will be synthesized at USF via a seed-mediated thermal decom-position synthesis method Magnetic characterization including hysteresis and temperature dependentmagnetization MvT will be performed at USF prior to beam time to identify relevant transition tem-peratures We will prepare 5 samples for measurements Fe3O4 cores with a Zn1 xCoxFe2O4 shell wherethe cobalt fraction x varies from 0 to 1 We will examine MNPs with a mean diameter of 18 nm forconsistency with Ref  Our focus will be on the pure Fe3O4  ZnFe2O4 MNPs as well as the x  02505 and 075 samples We measured the Fe3O4  CoFe2O4 in our Dec 2018 run although those sampleshad a diameter of only 11 nm We will bring 18 nm samples as wellProf Dario Arena will serve as the PI on the SANS measurements The NPs will be synthesized incollaboration with the group of Profs Hariharan Srikanth and Manh-Huong Phan of the University ofSouth Florida A graduate student from USF Ms Corisa Kons will have the main responsibility forcoordinating the sample synthesis and conducting the magnetometry measurements She will also conductthe SANS measurements and analysis at NCNR Ms Kons has already conducted PASANS measurementspreviously on the undoped system and has been actively studying the SANS analysis with SASView Thisproject will form a large section of her graduate thesis4 Beam Time Request Based on conversations with NCNR sta J Borchers and K Krycka wewould like to request 5 days of beam time on the vSANS instrument vSANS provides an extended Q rangewith polarized beam because of the two detector carriages and the location of the supermirror polarizerThe polarization e ciencies on vSANS are also very high  97 with long 3He cell lifetimes We willmeasure PASANS at two temperatures 5 K Tblock for each NP and three eld conditions FC HF FC0F 0FC HF for four or possibly ve NPs with varying Zn concentrations the undoped case being thelowest priority Field cooling and high eld measurements will be performed in a 15 T eld using the Titanmagnet There will be 24-30 separate measurement conditions four or ve samples three eld conditionstwo temperatures Assuming 4 hours per sample  eld condition  temperature to measure each of the 4spin cross sections required for PASANS it will require about 4 days in addition to setup cool down timesample mounting 3He cell replacement and empty cell measurements roughly 1 day total We request5 days total
