Spin dynamics study of the mono-domain BiFeO3 under magnetic field BiFeO3 is probably the most studied multiferroic because of its room temperature magnetoelectric coupling  ferroelectricity is the consequence of an improper structural transition at Tc  1100 K to the polar space group R3c In bulk samples the magnetic ordering transition occurs at TN  640 K Although the two order parameters do not coincide they are coupled through antisymmetric exchange ie P drives the appearance of the inhomogeneous magnetization through a coupling term PM where  is a coupling constant P is the polarization and the M is the magnetization The magnetic structure can be described locally as canted G-type but with a long period modulation  620  in the hexagonal basal plane  Later studies determined that the modulation is cycloidal with the spins rotating in the k z plane where k take the three symmetry-equivalent directions k1    0 k2   -2 0 and k2  -2  0 in the hexagonal setting of the R3c group at 300 K 3  Preliminary Work Previous inelastic neutron scattering studies are conducted on single crystal BiFeO3 5  Two excitation gaps originating from magnetic anisotropies have been observed The direct observation of the gaps allows an accurate determination of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya DM interaction and the single ion anisotropy The SW dispersion across the whole Brillouin zone be modeled by a simple Heisenberg Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor J1  44-65 meV next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction J2  015-029 meV DM term  011-016 meV and single-ion anisotropy K  0007 meV 5  Most importantly the presence of the DM interaction explains that a sizable magnetoelectric coupling in this compound and is the responsible for the spontaneous electric polarization Fig 1 Top

center reveals a unique feature near 1 meV associated with the interplay between the DM interaction D and single-ion anisotropy K Fig 3 Ref  The T-dependence of D K and exchange interactions indicates the anharmonicity of the magnetic cycloid and reveals a direct connection between the change in spin Hamiltonian parameters and the structural deformations of BiFeO3 Furthermore it is revealed that relevant balance between those parameters can be broken and the system undergoes an cycloidal to intermediate phase with magnetic field perpendicular to the polarization direction  When the field is above 8 Tesla a large magnetoelectric effect was observed and the spin modulation along the 11 hex becomes commensurate Figure  Given the magnetic ground state is essentially determined by the small modification of the DM interaction single-ion anisotropy K and exchange interaction we like to investigate the spin dynamics of the intermediate phase with CM propagation wavevector In contrast with all previous INS work where the samples are either multi-domain or prepared by assembling multiple small pieces we have grown a nearly single polar-domain 95 single crystal of BiFeO3 with sample mass around 35 grams bottom panel of Fig  This not only alleviates the large sample mosaic unavoidable from co-aligned sample assembly but also reduce the complexity of analyzing coexisting polar and magnetic domains Choice of Instrument The past INS experiments using time-of-flight spectrometers indicate that the characterization of the spin wave spectra benefits from the large detector coverage Since the overall energy scale is 70 meV and the spin-gap is slightly 2 meV we like to use the high-resolution DCS to investigate the evolution of the magnetic dynamics with application of the magnetic field After consulting our collaborator Dr Yiming Qiu we understand that DCS can be equipped with superconducting magnet with field up to 10 Tesla at 300 K Although the magnetic field is not sufficient to drive the system into the CM phase the characterization still provide critical information about the magnetic dynamics as the spin structure evolves from the ICM towards to the CM phase See Fig 2 The choice of single magnetic domain also alleviates the complication of the coexisting magnetic branching Experiment Plan We will pre-align the single crystal such that 11 and 1-1 in the pseudocubic notation is in the horizontal scattering plane the magnetic field in the vertical direction is orthogonal to the polarization The temperature will be maintained at 300 K We will first collect the data at H0 to serve as reference Then selective fields up to H10 Tesla will be applied 4T 7T 10T The large moment  5 B of Fe3 should make the experiment very feasible A total of 120 degrees angle coverage with 3 degree per step should provide the needed SqE in a large of reciprocal volume A total of 5 days is requested for the proposed experiment Reference Fig 3 a T-evolution of
