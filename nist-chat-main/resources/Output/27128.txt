investigate the role of hydrogen in superconductivity of topochemically prepared infinite layer nickelate thin films using neutron diffraction and other complementary chemical analysis methods Nickelates have been long predicted to be a possible host for superconductivity due to the ground state of antiferromagnetic insulator phases and a several other systematic similarities to the cuprates12 Many years of research into inducing superconductivity in nickelates had failed but recently topochemical reduction of Nd08Sr02NiO3 realized the superconducting nickelate phase Nd08Sr02NiO23 Despite initial efforts to induce superconductivity in the structurally analogous LaNiO2 and NdNiO2 Nd08Sr02NiO2 seems to exhibit superconductivity with a transition temperature between 9-15 K The origin of this variation in superconductivity in topochemically reduced nominally similar Nd08Sr02NiO2 thin films likely originates in variations in defects induced during the reduction Further besides the superconducting properties the normal state also showed large variations in the temperature dependence of resistivity and carrier density presumably tied to the oxygen andor hydrogen content in the films It is well known that CaH2 based topochemical reduction not only creates oxygen vacancies but also fills such sites with negatively charged hydrogen which acts as a donor45 Hence it is important to understand the interplay of underlying structural and chemical factors that decide the nature of superconductivity in these materials In order to understand this phenomenon we propose to use neutron reflectometry which has been shown to be highly sensitive to hydrogen and oxygen vacancies to further understand this interplay Background High temperature superconductivity remains an important open problem in condensed matter physics research While the mechanistic understanding of this phenomena is critical to enable next generation of superconductors especially with transition temperature at room temperature or close to it discovery of new classes of superconductors using rational but heuristic approaches remains an active area of research Such research activities led to the discovery of new classes of superconductors such as Fe-based superconductors6-8 Hence there is significant interest in exploring superconducting phases with structural and chemical characteristics similar to the widely studied hole doped cuprates For example several theoretically predictions expected Ni if stabilized in a structurally similar framework to the cuprates could host high temperature superconductivity12 As Ni likes to stabilize in Ni2 and Ni3 one must kinetically stabilize the Ni state Recently there is significant interest in stabilizing metastable phases of oxides using topochemical reduction process This is a low temperature reduction method where highly active hydrogen species are thermally generated from CaH2 at relatively low temperatures of  200 - 600C Such a low temperature reduction allows the material to assume metastable states which are unstable if a thermodynamic synthetic approach is undertaken This method was widely used to achieve metastable phases such as infinite layer square lattice compounds of LaNiO2 or doped SrTiO3-xHx49 Following these studies superconductivity was discovered in Nd08Sr02NiO2 which was synthesized from epitaxial thin films of Nd08Sr02NiO3 grown on SrTiO3 001 substrates In this proposal we will aim to use neutron scattering to address some of the open questions on superconductivity in this material Preliminary Results The research team has significant experience with topochemical reduction of complex oxide thin films and the growth of nickelate films510-13 In the past we have demonstrated electron doping in BaZrO3 which is a wide band gap oxide with a gap of 53 eV This is a widely used material for proton conduction in solid oxide fuels with a small electron affinity of 25 eV These characteristics make this a challenging material to induce electron doping but electron doping in this system could have beneficial effects for electrochemical and electron emission applications Our topochemical reduction method allows us to achieve nearly metallic temperature dependent resistivity for highly reduced BaZrO3 We monitored the evolution of the texture of epitaxial thin films of BaZrO3 using x-ray diffraction and found that the electron doping was accompanied by a gradual loss of texture possibly amorphization of the films Nevertheless the origin of the electron doping in high concentration a sheet carrier density of  1016 cm-2 for an 80 nm film remained unexplained There is significant controversy of whether oxygen vacancies can be considered shallow donors and role of negatively charged hydrogen as a donor in oxides is gaining ground To this end we performed neutron reflectometry to characterize the depth resolved hydrogen substituents and oxygen vacancy concentration in the topochemically reduced BaZrO3 thin films We also performed depth resolved secondary ion mass spectrometry to confirm the thickness dependent oxygen vacancy and hydrogen concentrations obtained from fitting the neutron reflectivity as shown in Figure 2 The results clearly highlight the inhomogeneous distribution of the oxygen vacancies and hydrogen substituents but both seem to qualitatively scale opposite to each other We wish to apply a similar approach to the current proposed project of understanding the role of oxygen and hydrogen content in the superconductivity of nickelates As a first step to execute this project we have successfully synthesized 10 nm thick high quality single crystalline epitaxial thin films of Nd08Sr02NiO3 on SrTiO3 001 substrates with and without SrTiO3 cap layers of 10 nm thickness The SrTiO3 can act as a diffusion barrier for the oxygen and hydrogen species when the samples are stored in ambient or other comparable conditions As we anticipate Ni state of nickelates to be unstable we may observe gradual changes in the Figure 1 The out of plane x-ray diffraction of BaZrO3 thin films grown on LSAT substrates after topochemical reduction at different temperatures noted The rocking curve of the as grown film and the substrate are compared in the inset The optical image of the as grown and reduced films is also shown in the inset Figure 2 SIMS data and the scattering length density results from neutron reflectivity comparing the normalized oxygen and H signals of fully and partially reduced BZO with a control sample of amorphous unreduced BZO chemical state of nickelates when stored in ambient conditions for a few days Film cross-sectional area is 1010 mm2 We show representative XRD patterns of such films without cap in Figure 3 We will perform topochemical reduction with procedures similar to what was used earlier to achieve superconductivity Proposed Experiment We propose to understand the role of oxygen vacancies and hydrogen doping on the resulting superconducting state and normal state of infinite layer nickelates To that end we will examine a series of topochemically reduced samples of Nd08Sr02NiO3 NSNO grown on SrTiO3 001 STO substrates with and without SrTiO3 cap layers of 10 nm thickness We will perform unpolarized neutron reflectometry using the PBR instrument on the following 6 films 1 As-grown 10 nm Nd08Sr02NiO3 2 Topochemically reduced 10 nm Nd08Sr02NiO3 3 Topochemically reduced 10 nm Nd08Sr02NiO3 vacuum annealed at 250 C 300 C and 350 C 400 C to remove hydrogen without introducing oxygen As we have shown previously PNR allows the depth-dependent hydrogen distribution in reduced samples to be quantified and compared By studying a series of vacuum annealed samples at different temperature the hydrogen will be progressively removed so that the roles of oxygen vacancies and hydrogen dopants may be separated and quantified We will thus elucidate the correlation between the superconducting Tc and the normal state properties to the deduced hydrogen and oxygen vacancy concentration from neutron reflectometry As in our previous work we will also perform complementary SIMS study to confirm the results of the neutron reflectometry studies Because the measurements may be performed at room-temperature with an unpolarized beam on a 11 cm2 film we expect that data collection and sample changes will be rapid even though a relatively wide Q-range up to 02 nm-1 must be collected to resolve the relatively thin surfaces layers which are anticipated We therefore request a single day per sample for a total of 6 days on PBR References 1 Lee K W  Pickett W E Phys Rev B 70 2149 2004 2 Anisimov V I Bukhvalov D  Rice T M Phys Rev B 59 7901-7906 1999 3
