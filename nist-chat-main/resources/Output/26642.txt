Ultra small angle neutron scattering on solutions of carbon nanotubes in chlorosulfonic acid and carbon nanotube fibers Scientific Importance and Previous Work Individual carbon nanotubes CNTs have excellent mechanical thermal and electrical properties CNTs can be processed into high performance macroscale materials by solution processing in chlorosulfonic acid Once dissolved the CNTs behave as rigid rods in solution and form liquid crystals at sufficiently high concentrations These high concentration solutions 05 - 10 wt  CNTs are used to form CNT fibers by solution processing In short fibers are made by extruding the solution through a spinneret into a coagulation bath The fiber is then collected onto a rotating drum The shear through the spinneret and the draw on the fiber from the drum create highly aligned fibers The fibers have important applications as lightweight wires and cables in aircraft and lightweight composite reinforcements in cars Our current work has demonstrated that spinning from lower weight concentration solutions results in stronger fiber Figure 1 While making improvements in fiber strength is exciting lowering the concentration of CNTs is not ideal from a process standpoint as it is grossly inefficient Therefore we are interested in discovering the mechanism behind the strength increase so that improvements can be made in processing the solutions We have already ruled out the possibility that we are coagulant limited by changing the diameter of the spinneret Smaller spinnerets would cause a higher surface area to volume ratio of the liquid filament during fiber formation but fiber properties are constant with spinneret diameter We believe that the improvement in strength must be attributed to either alignment of the CNTs in the fiber or the size of the CNT bundles We hypothesize that the lower concentration solution has a smaller excluded volume which causes the CNTs to align more easily and more completely during processing Therefore the improvement in strength would be a function of alignment Alternatively the domain size of the liquid crystals in the CNT solution may be larger for lower concentration solutions which would result in CNT fibers that are made up of larger super ropes of CNTs The current theory in literature is that that breaking 00511522530 1 2 3 4Tensile Strength GPaCNT Concentration wtFigure 1 Tensile strength of carbon nanotube fibers as a function of CNT concentration in the processing solutions The overlapping data points at 3 wt are for a 100 m bottom and 150 m top spinneret force of CNT fibers is the result of these super ropes sliding past each other rather than individual tubes sliding past each other3 Thus fibers containing larger super ropes would have a larger tensile strength We plan to resolve these two possibilities by using USANS to determine the long-range characteristic length scale of the CNT solutions and fibers Experimental Plan We propose two sets of related experiments First we propose using USANS to study high concentration solutions of CNTs in CSA ranging from 3 to 10 wt Previous work in our group has demonstrated that SANS can give us dimensions of relatively short range ordering of CNTs the distance between individual CNTs in solution We have used the data from Ref 5 for 1 wt solutions of CNTs to predict the scattering figure of merit for a 5 mm path length and transmittance of 50 from NIST calculator for CSA at 10-3 -1 We assumed the slope of IQ at low Q would be the same as that found in Ref 5 and that IQ scales linearly with concentration We predict a figure of merit of 94 for 3 wt solutions and 310 for 10 wt solutions These values suggest the scattering should be sufficient for us to measure these solutions The power law behavior from previous work suggests fractal-like structuring in our solutions We believe that USANS will potentially reveal a turnover in the signal at lower Q indicating a finite size of the fractal dimension We expect that size to vary with the concentration of the CNTs allowing us to draw conclusions about the structure of the spinning solutions Second we propose studying the fibers spun from a range of CNT solutions using USANS By creating large yarns 1 mm in diameter from our CNT fibers we can provide sufficient sample to ensure good signal across the full Q range We have worked with NIST to acquire preliminary data on a single CNT yarn with brief results for 1 and 2-D shown in Figure 2 These preliminary results were acquired from 3 minute exposures at the 3 highest Q ranges and a 200 minute exposure at the lowest Q range These results suggest that we will have no issues obtaining sufficient signal To further improve signal we will cover the full beam area with a parallel array of CNT yarns We will measure the yarns parallel and perpendicular to the beam to account for anisotropy in the scattering and use the rotating cell to collect a proper average if necessary As in our solutions the data in Figure 2A suggest power law fractal-like behavior at decreasing Q USANS may confirm that this behavior extends to very large length scales or it will reveal a length scale at which this behavior breaks down Both panels of Figure 2 show a peak at 027 -1 which corresponds with the wall-to-wall distance characteristic of the primarily double-walled CNTs used in our materials We plan to run solutions of 10 wt 5 wt and 3 wt for 8 hours each and three fibers spun from 10 wt 5 wt3 wt and 1 wt solutions for 6 hours each We are requesting 25 days of beam-time to perform these experiments For future communication please contact PhD students Lauren Taylor lwt1riceedu and Oliver Dewey osd1riceedu or Prof Matteo Pasquali mpriceedu The proposed work would be an essential part of Lauren Taylors and Oliver Deweys PhD theses The possible insight obtained by these experiments would be the final piece needed to publish a journal article Figure 2 Preliminary results from a single CNT yarn with brief SANS beam exposure a 1-D results across the four scanned Q-ranges showing a clear peak at about 027 -1 followed by power law behavior as Q decreasing b 2-D results from the same fiber at the highest Q range showing the peak at 027 -1 and an interesting bow-tie shape Safety Considerations Guidelines established with NIST during previous use of the facilities will be followed Chlorosulfonic acid is highly corrosive and will only be used with compatible materials in a fume hood or glove box Solutions will be sealed in a cell within a fume hood and will be transported to the beam line using secondary containment Proper personal protection equipment such as nitrile gloves safety glasses and lab coat will be worn at all times Citations  S
