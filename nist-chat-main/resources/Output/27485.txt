Conformation and Self-Assembly of Conjugated Polymers in the Presence of Polystyrene using Contrast Variation Small-Angle Neutron Scattering This is a coupled proposal for both NGB-30 SANS and BT5 USANS instruments Motivation Conjugated polymers CPs enable low-cost lightweight and flexible organic electronic devices such as photovoltaics field-effect transistors OFETs and chemosensors when compared to inorganic equivalents1-3 Advantageously macroscopic CP performance can be related to structure and morphology45 but they also remain costly compared to commodity polymers inefficient and prone to environmental degradation and cracking preventing wide scale implementation67 In pursuit of improved devices researchers have looked into polymer blends of conjugated and non-conjugated materials6-8 as a way to counteract some of these disadvantages These blends are comprised of a conjugated polymer mixed in a matrix of lower-cost mechanically-favorable commodity polymer commonly either polystyrene PS or polyethylene PE Goffri et al found that by blending regio-regular poly3-hexylthiophene RRe-P3HT with various forms of polyethylene or polystyrene OFET performance was minimally impacted even at P3HT concentrations as low as 3 wt see Figure 16 Moreover they found that semi-crystalline or crystalline matrix polymers PE or PS encouraged crystallization of the conjugated polymer and improved performance Qiu and researchers found that by blending P3HT and PS they could significantly improve environmental stability compared to a pure P3HT layer7 Han and coworkers also found both solvent and PS molecular weight to have significant effects on the performance of their OFET ammonia sensors using these blends9 It is known that the performance and morphology of these polymer blends is significantly affected by the processing methods eg solvents and drying both in the literature89 and in our work discussed below but to enable control of these blends to design improved devices we must understand more of these relationships In this work we will utilize small-angle neutron scattering SANS to infer polymer-polymer interactions of conjugated and non-conjugated polymer blends in precursor solutions to understand the mechanisms by which the presence of a commodity polymer affects the morphology These conjugated and non-conjugated polymer blends provide a challenge for characterization in that we are interested in the structure of one organic material in another yet with contrast variation SANS provides the opportunity to quantitatively explore the morphology in these systems Our work on these blends thus far has primarily focused on probing the structure and self-assembly of conjugated polymers blended with polystyrene while in the final solid film state In Figure 2 top plot we provide VSANS and USANS data collected at the NIST Center for Neutron Research for both dilute and concentrated amounts of RRe-P3HT semi-crystalline blended with deuterated polystyrene and dried from precursor solutions with three different solvents toluene chloroform and bromobenzene intermediate good and excellent solvents for P3HT When investigating the crystallizable RRe-P3HT we find a growing feature between 001 and 01 -1 one that has been observed in previous work from our group10 for systems of P3HT in certain solvents and is indicative of the growth of crystalline nanofibers Interestingly the samples dried from toluene show the presence of nanofibers even at very low concentrations of P3HT If we consider the 01 wt RRe-P3HT solid sample in the precursor solution the equivalent P3HT concentration in solution would be 005 mgmL At this concentration and without the presence of polystyrene we would not expect this sample to self-assemble based on previous work in our group5 yet these structures are induced in mixtures with PS at these extremely low concentrations While nanofibers are present at high concentrations of P3HT for all samples if we investigate the low-Q limit we begin to see changes to the connectivity of these fibers based on the solvent For Figure 1 Field effect mobility of devices made from blends of poly3-hexyl thiophene in either polyethylene top or polystyrene bottom Figure is from the work of Goffri and coworkers6 bromobenzene and chloroform systems we begin to see a plateau forming in the USANS data while for the toluene system the USANS data continues to increase This is suggesting that solvents of chloroform and bromobenzene result in shorter branched nanofibers while the toluene results in longer nanofibers These features are important in that variations in nanowire structure and connectivity controls charge transport mechanisms and is therefore directly relevant to device performance Ongoing impedance spectroscopy measurements will be used to quantify the effects of these structures on electronic performance of these blends We should stress that all of these samples are identical in composition after solvent evaporation yet there are morphological differences suggesting that the solvent affects the final structure during the processing stages ie solvent evaporation for these blends It is evident that unique polymer-solvent interactions are at play that need to be better understood if we are to control the final blend morphology In this work we will utilize SANS to answer the following questions regarding these behaviors in the precursor solution 1 Are the P3HT and PS interactions attractive or non-attractive 2 If P3HT and PS chains are non-interacting by what mechanisms do the PS chains encourage the self-assembly of P3HT and how is that influenced by PS concentration and molecular weight Preliminary Data To test feasibility of this experiment utilizing the VSANS and USANS instruments at the NCNR we collected some preliminary data for a blend of RRe-P3HT and PS at a 19 weight ratio in deuterated toluene at a total polymer concentration of 50 mgmL see Figure 3 This corresponds to a 10wt RRe-P3HT in PS solid sample dissolved in toluene Moreover we utilized both deuterated and hydrogenated versions of polystyrene to explore its scattering contribution in the ternary system In our proposed work see experimental plan below we will utilize a partially deuterated polystyrene sample that will allow us to contrast match the PS component to toluene minimizing its contribution to the scattering data and allowing us to analyze P3HT-P3HT and P3HT-PS interactions with contrast variation SANS or CV-SANS Since P3HT is also known to self-assemble into long nanowires micrometers in length when dissolved in toluene we need to use both SANS and USANS to collect data across the entire Q-range for this study Specifically we expect to determine the influence of polystyrene chains on this self-assembly process in solution Experimental Plan - SANS The first part of our proposed experiment will investigate the polymer-polymer ie P3HT-P3HT PS-P3HT interactions in a precursor solution at a dilute concentration We will use monodisperse RRe-P3HT fully hydrogenated PS PS-H and partially deuterated PS PS-D85 contrast matched to deuterated toluene approximately 85 deuteration at similar molecular weights to confirm whether or not the P3HT and PS chains are interacting Considering our preliminary data and the extreme phase segregation we observe we hypothesize that the P3HT-PS interaction is non-attractive This measurement will involve blends of P3HTPS-H and P3HTPS-D each at a 11 molar ratio dissolved in toluene at the dilute limit at 3 different temperatures 25 C Figure 2 VSANS and USANS data collected at the NCNR for polymer blends of regio-regular poly3-hexyl thiophene RRe-P3HT and either deuterated or hydrogenated polystyrene deut-PS or hyd-PS Top plot shows data collected for solid films of P3HT and deut-PS blends dried from precursor solutions with different solvents Bottom plot shows data collected for a 19 P3HTPS weight ratio blend dissolved in deuterated toluene 50 C and 75 C For this experiment we will work with our collaborator Christine Luscombe to synthesize the necessary materials Additionally we will utilize UV-Vis measurements at our home facility prior to the SANS experiment to understand the concentration at which our P3HT sample assembles in toluene with and without the presence of polystyrene to ensure we are at the dilute limit The second part of our proposed experiment will investigate the mechanisms by which the presence of polystyrene influences the conformation and self-assembly of RRe-P3HT in toluene More specifically at a P3HT concentration in toluene that does not readily form nanofibers would the addition of polystyrene into the system encourage self-assembly How do changes to PS molecular weight and concentration influence that behavior We hypothesize that in solution P3HT and PS chains are phase separating encouraging the closer arrangement and self-assembly of the P3HT As the PS chains either grow in molecular weight or become more concentrated we think self-assembly is further encouraged due to the changing osmotic pressure in solution see Figure 3 To test this we will investigate blends of RRe-P3HT and PS synthesized by our collaborator dissolved in toluene at a low enough P3HT concentration that would not normally form nanofibers on its own We will investigate 4 different PS molecular weights at 20 kgmol similar to our P3HT 100 kgmol 200 kgmol and 400 kgmol blended with P3HT at a 11 molar ratio Moreover we will investigate the effect of concentration by blending P3HT and PS with similar molecular weights at P3HTPS molar ratios of 11 15 110 and 120 All polymer solutions will be loaded into the standard demountable SANS cells Measurements will be taken up to a Q of 0002 -1 to ensure overlap with the corresponding SANS data Each part of our experiment will require approximately 15 samples and we expect the majority of samples to self-assemble and require USANS data in addition to the SANS data Based on our preliminary measurements each sample should not take more than 5-6 hours Accounting for additional time of background measurements we estimate that 8 days of beam time on BT5 USANS is sufficient to collect all necessary data References 1 K a Mazzio
