 Page 1 of 2 Zwitterionic Polymers Interactions Dynamics and Structure Amir Erfani Javen Weston Katie Weigandt Josh Ramsey and Clint P Aichele Background and Scientific Importance During the last decade polyzwitterions polymers with equal numbers of opposite charges on each monomer have gained researchers attention due to their anti-biofouling and anti-protein-adsorption properties 1  Recently our work has shown how these interactions can be tuned to prevent protein aggregation  These polyzwitterions have very complicated phase behavior and solubility characteristics The polyzwitterions dynamics interactions and structure in solution are not well understood Dynamic light scattering DLS studies indicated that polyzwitterions can show anti-polyelectrolyte behavior increasing solubility by addition of salts 4  While DLS can indicate the aggregate formation and their sizes it is unable to evaluate structure and conformational changes polymer Porod number and polymer stiffening In this work the structure and complexation of polyzwitterions will be studied in the presence of different ions salts using SANS The results of these experiments could provide insights into the structure of the polymer aggregates due to self-assembly of polyzwitterions Our hypothesis is that ions in solution can associate with the zwitterionic groups on the polymer thereby altering the structure of the polymer Currently we are synthesizing three types of zwitterionic polymers We have macroscopic experimental evidence that indicates that the hydration and solubility of these polymers can be improved by the addition of ions but by using SANS we will be able to evaluate the hydration structure and dynamics of these polyzwitterions Preliminary Work Currently we are studying three types of zwitterionic polymers synthesized in our lab in addition to hydrogels prepared by chemical crosslinking of these polymers These polymers are poly-sulfobetaine PSB  poly-carboxy betaine PCB  and poly-phosphobetaine PMPC  and have been studied for their interaction with biologics We have carried out 1H NMR and diffusion NMR experiments to characterize these polymers Fig 1 illustrates some of the experimental characterizations and Fig 2 shows some preliminary SANS measurements measured at the NIST Center for Neutron Researchs NGB-10m SANS instrument for the polymer studied here Fig1 Left schematic of the poly-zwitterion Middle SEM of PSB zwitterionic hydrogel crosslinked polymer beads Right hydrogels loaded with fluorescently labelled albumin Fig2 Scattering intensity curves of buffered PSB solution in D2O A model fit indicates that the PSB studied here has a radius of gyration of 14 nm and porod exponent of -18 which indicates that PSBMA is very well-solubilized in the buffer solution and very flexible Page 2 of 2 Data Analysis and Scientific Outcomes Scattering will be analyzed using the SasView program along with appropriate models for dissolved polymers The results of this study will help the PhD student Amir Erfani involved in this project to complete his researchthesis on the interactions of zwitterionic moieties with proteins Results will be published in top peer-reviewed journals such as Langmuir Biomacromolecules and ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering The results of this study will provide fundamental insights into the mechanism by which zwitterionic moieties are dissolved in aqueous solutions and form aggregates due to inter-chain association This better understanding can later translate to designing functional protein-polymer complexes for protein delivery and anti-biofouling surfaces Experimental Plan Well-defined narrowly poly-dispersed polymers will be synthesized in our lab and will be studied at concentrations up to 50 mgml The structures and interactions our experiments intend to probe are perfectly within the range of those probed by the SANS instrument 1-100 nm As summarized in Table I zwitterionic polymers are added to salt solutions as co-solutes By varying the polymer polymer concentration salt valance and salt concentration we expect to observe significant changes in the polymer behavior A total of 72 samples will be characterized and we expect each measurement to take 1 hour We request 3 days of beamtime on a 30 m SANS instrument to complete the experiment as described Table I Effect of ions on
