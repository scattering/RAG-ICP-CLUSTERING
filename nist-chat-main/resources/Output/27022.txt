Sciences Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China 200240 2Center for Neutron Research National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg MD USA 20899 1 Background and Context Deoxyribonucleic acid DNA is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses The investigation on DNA shows that the hydration water is crucial for DNAs dynamics functions and structures1 We found that the mean square atomic displacement MSD of water molecules on the surface of DNA with different nucleotide sequence is different within 100 ns which indicates that the dynamics of hydration water are influenced by the sequence of nucleotides Although we have simulated the MSD of two kinds of DNA with 03 hydration level g waterg DNA by Molecular Dynamics MD simulation its quite difficult to give a strong and direct evidence of the distinction between two kinds of water dynamics at different temperatures and hydration levels More importantly for MD simulations the constructed system of DNA with hydration water will be vacuumized if the hydration at low level We believe that the water molecules play an important part in DNA stability especially in function state Fortunately by performing quasi-elastic neutron scattering the dynamic structure factor Sq  is obtained to reveals the distribution of dynamic modes of hydration water on DNAs surface and how the nucleotide sequence affects the dynamics of hydration water Besides the hydration water may also have various effects on dynamical transition of DNA with different nucleotide sequence which can be measured by elastic scan Moreover to decouple the dynamical transition of DNA and its surface water we plan to measure dry DNA DNA with H2O and DNA with D2O Water in the natural world is often found under constrained and restricted environments Properties of water under such constrained conditions can be quite different from those of bulk neat water However the water retains some of its unique properties even under restricted conditions Study of these unique properties of water molecules especially in the hydration level of proteins4 and DNA6 has been widely studied The hydration water not only provides the stability of the biomolecules structure but also plays an important role in the biological activity The intercalation of antitumor drugs such as daunomycin into DNA involves active participation of water molecules in the grooves8 Therefore understanding the dynamics of hydration water on DNAs surface is significant in the relationship between water and DNA Moreover investigating the dynamics of DNA with different nucleotide sequences and their surface water can relate the dynamics of water and the structures of DNA ie this investigation can reveal how the structures of DNA affect the dynamics of hydration water 2 2 Preliminary results and experimental plan As shown in Figure 1 we have synthesized two kinds of DNA with different nucleotide sequence and name DNA CGCGAATTCGCG and CGCGTTAACGCG as DNA-AATT and DNA-TTAA respectively Figure 2 presents the MD-derived MSD for hydration water on DNA-AATT and DNA-TTAA in the time window from 100 ps to 100 ns Although only four nucleotides are changed the sequence the values of MSD of DNA-TTAA are larger than that of DNA-AATT It indicates that the water molecules on DNA-TTAAs surface are more dynamical than that on DNA-AATTs surface However the MD simulation cannot give a strong evidence that the dynamics of hydration water are indeed affected by the sequence of nucleotides More importantly how many layers of water can be affected by the sequences of DNAs nucleotides are still unknown Fortunately by performing quasi-elastic neutron scattering on DNA with different hydration levels this question can be solved It is widely accepted that the dynamical transition of DNA is coupled with hydration water However we are unable to separate the contribution of water molecules during transition The combination of elastic neutron scattering and DNA with D2O sample may offer a great opportunity to separate the dynamics contribution from DNA and its surface water Then we could recognize the influence of water molecules on DNA with different nucleotide sequence Here we would like to measure the elastic and quasi-elastic spectra of dry DNA and DNA with different hydration levels For elastic scan the measurement temperature is ranged from 10 K to 300 K and the heating rate is set as 1 Kmin For quasi-elastic scan the q is ranged from 01-1875 -1 and temperature is set as 280 K Moreover for elastic scan the samples include dry DNA and DNA at the hydration level of 03 gram H2O and D2O1 gram DNA As for quasi-elastic scan the samples include DNA at the hydration level of 03 and 08 gram H2O1 gram DNA 3 Beamtime requested For elastic scan measurement 12 hourcondition x 6 samples  3 hours time for measuring background and changing a sample etc  75 hours are required For quasi-elastic scan measurement 6 hoursampleThydration level x 2 samples x 1 temperatures x 2 hydration level  6 hours time for changing T  3 hours time for measuring background and changing a sample etc  33 hours Consequently we are requesting 105 hours 5 days beam time for the proposed experiments including the sample
