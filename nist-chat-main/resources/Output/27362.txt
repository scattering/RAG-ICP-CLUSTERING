Magnetic Excitations of a Time-Reversal and Inversion Symmetry Breaking Weyl Semi-Metal Motivation and goal of the experiment The discovery of quantum materials with new and useful properties is an important frontier of research in condensed matter physics The concept of topology has recently flourished that field via theoretical predictions of materials with exotic surface state properties that are protected by specific symmetry of the bulk crystal  Various topological non-trivial states have been predicted such as a Weyl semimetal where Weyl fermions emerge in a material due to a linear energy-momentum dispersion within its electronic bulk structure  Weyl fermions can be generated by inversion symmetry breaking or by time-reversal symmetry breaking An inversion symmetry breaking Weyl semimetal is realized in a few materials such as TaAs  However a robust experimental realization of a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl semimetal remains scarce Recently ab-initio calculations predicted that materials of composition ReAlGe where Re is a rare earth ion are unique templates for studying Weyl physics  In addition to breaking inversion symmetry these materials are special due to the presence of magnetic Re ions that also allows the possibility of breaking time-reversal symmetry Following this theoretical study linearly dispersive electronic bands attributed to Weyl fermions were observed by ARPES in the non-magnetic LaAlGe  These works motivate experimental efforts in characterizing the magnetism and electronic band structure of magnetic materials with identical space group than LaAlGe Within that perspective we found that NdAlSi is promising because it shares the same crystal structure as LaAlGe but also has ferromagnetic order at low temperature Hence this system breaks time-reversal symmetry in addition to inversion symmetry Our initial neutron diffraction investigations on NdAlSi have shown this material has a ferrimagnetic ground state which is parametrized by three different magnetic ordering vectors that all onset at different temperatures Particularly interesting is the presence of an incommensurate order with an anomalously long spatial modulation  156  at intermediate temperatures Understanding the origin of this incommensurate phase requires knowledge of the relevant spin interactions in this system The spin interactions can be quantified in an inelastic neutron scattering through an accurate fitting of the spin wave excitations We thus seek to perform inelastic neutron scattering on NdAlSi and learn about the important magnetic interactions driving the incommensurability in NdAlSi Allowed due to its non-centrosymmetric structure Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions may be responsible for this incommensurability  Long-range RKKY interactions could also explain this phenomenon  This latter interaction involves coupling with the conductive electrons which in NdAlSi are Weyl fermions Characterization of the samples Using flux growth techniques in collaboration with the group of Fazel Tafti in Boston College we have grown single crystals of NdAlSi with typical mass of 50 to 80 mg All crystals were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction magnetization resistivity and heat capacity measurements The structural refinement against the x-ray diffraction pattern of NdAlSi is shown in Fig1 B The x-ray pattern of NdAlSi shows phase pure that is well described by a 109 tetragonal space group This space group breaks inversion symmetry due to the ordering of the Al and Si lattices However the same quality fit can be obtained using the tetragonal space group 141 where the AlSi lattices are disordered and in this case the structure does not break inversion symmetry Second-harmonic generation measurements have determined that NdAlSi breaks inversion symmetry so we inferred these materials crystallize into the 109 space group Magnetization data of NdAlSi is shown in Fig1 C and reveals ferromagnetic order near 35 K Heat capacity measurement is plotted in Fig1 D and while there is a peak in the heat capacity around 35 K the phase transition occurs slightly above near 8 K We have investigated the zero-field phase diagram of NdAlSi using the cold neutron triple-axis SPINS at NIST A summary of our neutron diffraction results is shown in Fig1 E where the temperature dependence of the different observed magnetic ordering vectors is plotted Long-range antiferromagnetic order was detected below 8 K with ordering vector k  23230 This magnetic ordering induces a gradual increase of an incommensurate order with k  00 where   0027 Near 35 K the incommensurate phase vanishes and a long-range ferromagnetic order with k  000 appears We wish to measure the spin excitations of NdAlSi within all those different magnetic phases to gain knowledge of the required spin Hamiltonian needed to describe the magnetism of this unique Weyl semi-metal candidate Plan of the experiment We have developed the protocols to grow and co-align 15-20 samples total mass of about 1-15 gr such that we can assemble the required mass needed in order to conduct an inelastic neutron scattering experiment on NdAlSi All the crystals will be co-aligned with the c axis perpendicular to the scattering plane This will allows the collection of inelastic neutron scattering spectra within the HK0 plane which covers range in momentum space that includes all three different ordering vectors The samples mosaic will be mounted in an orange cryostat to reach a base temperature of about 15 K which is below the lowest magnetic transition observed in NdAlSi The actual measurements will consist of 180 rotation scans with Ef37 meV for incident energies from the elastic line to 5-8 meV We shall employ the fully focusing configuration and given the large moment associated with neodymium we expect that such complete measurements of spin waves within each temperature phase can be achieved within  32 days Thus a total of 6 days will be needed to map out the full spin wave excitations of NdAlSi This procedure will include measurements within the paramagnetic state T  8 K the pure 23230 phase at 8 K  T  6 K the 23230  00 phase at 6 K  T  35 K and finally the 23230  000 phase at T  35 K An empty can measurement will also be needed to quantify the background  Moore Joel E The birth of topological insulators
