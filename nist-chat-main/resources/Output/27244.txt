Structure reversibility of solvent segregation driven gel SeedGel with tunable gelation temperatures investigated by vSANS and USANS Spinodal decomposition of a binary solvent can result in tortuous and interconnected liquid structures which possess high surface areas However those continuous liquid channels are neither thermodynamically nor kinetically stable without additional mechanism to capture the structure The domain coarsening eventually evolves into bulk phase separation In 2007 bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel bijel served as the first experimental evidence for arresting this structure1 In the work particle surface was treated to be neutrally wetted to both liquids and thus ensure their jamming at the liquid-liquid interface Since then bicontinuous structure has found applications in various research fields including catalysis energy storage as well as biomedical applications2-4 However after one decade of research limitations of bijel still remain The strict often nontrivial requirement for neutrally wettability of particle surface greatly hinders its synthesis Moreover the fast quenching rate 17Cmin not only prevents large scale production it also weakens the ability to manipulate structure with temperature Due to its formation mechanism it is rather difficult to adjust the domain size and control the structure once bijel is formed Recently we have demonstrated that particles that favor one component of a binary solvent are sufficient to arrest the bicontinous structure It is named as solvent segregation driven gel SeedGel 5 Our previous work not only unveils the formation mechanism it also shows SeedGel as a robust preparation method that allow a large room for structure tunability No additional surface treatment on the particle is necessary and quasi-static ramping rate of 1Chr is fast enough to generate SeedGel USANS and SANS play critical roles in providing quantitative information on the thermo-responsive structure Figure 1a shows the scattering profiles resulting from SeedGel prepared from water and 26-lutidine mixture at 30C The compliment optical microscopy and cryo-TEM techniques agree well with scattering results regarding the domain size and particle-particle distance Interestingly the structure formation process is thermally reversible Figure 1b The q-4 decay between 310-4 -1 and 310-3 -1 indicate a smooth surface of the domain interface within SeedGel By fitting the USANS data to Teubner-Strey model the domain size is determined to be about 3 m Scattering results from both q-ranges indicate a gelation temperature of 26C As a thermo-responsive-reversible material the ability to customize the gelation temperature as well as domain size are of the utmost importance to accommodate the needs from different applications In this proposed experiment we have identified solvent pair and ramping rate as major pathways to achieve structure tunability We will also address the question of temperature reversibility in different systems As the percolation of the SeedGel is driven by solvent segregation tuning the miscibility of binary mixture could directly control structure and transition point It has been reported that the phase separation temperature of bulk binary solvent could be shifted from 13C to 34C by using different isomers of lutidine 6 The addition of a third component 3-methylpyridine into the system could further raise the critical point to above 60 C By controlling the amount of the third solvent the gelation temperature could be changed at will 6 Recently we obtained promising results on varying gelation temperature by using 25-lutidine and 24-lutidine Figure 2 shows the characterization of their gelation point with USANS The gelation temperature is reduced from 26C to 8C Figure 2a and 18C Figure 2b respectively Those results demonstrated the possibility to shift the gel point by tuning the miscibility of solvents in the molecular level In order to obtain a library of a wide range of gelation temperatures the effect on transition temperature from 3-methylpyridine addition to water-lutidine mixture also needs to be explored It is possible that the introduction of multi-component solvent may affect the attractive capillary force and change the overall structure With temperature dependent vSANS and USANS experiments this change if any would be uncovered Gel is not a thermodynamically stable state thus the kinetics of the process could possibly alter the structure The change of ramping rate has been reported to change the structure and property of bijel 7 It would be both interesting and important to understand how the ramping rate would affect the final structure of SeedGel As for the thermo-reversibility of the structure temperature cycles between high and low temperatures will be performed for multiple repetitions and the scattering profiles will be compared for the aforementioned solvent pairs to check reversibility in all length scales In summary we are planning to investigate the effect of solvent pairs on the gelation temperature and reversibility on the multi-length structures of SeedGel It is also important to systematically understand how the ramping rate would affect the formation of SeedGel To cover the whole q-range both USANS and vSANS will be performed The vSANS is needed to study the kinetic effect of the structural evolution during the temperature change as it can cover a wide Q range without moving detectors The scattering intensity at low-q range of our data is strong enough to use the high resolution detector so that there will be a good overlap between USANS and vSANS data The samples will be prepared in the same way as in our previous proposals Silica nanoparticles in a mixture of water and lutidine will be used The binary solvent include water and lutidine isomers such as 24-lutidine 25-lutidine and 26-lutidine For each solvent condition a series of temperatures will be performed to check the reversibility and determine the gelation temperature In addition different ramping rates will be achieved by increasing the temperature and record scattering profile of the sample from 4C to 30C at every one degree every five degrees and every ten degrees In total we have  100 conditions with each sample  30 min SANS time and at least 3 hrs USANS time required Taking the temperature change and beam alignment into consideration we are requesting 3 days of vSANS time and 8 days of USANS time to complete the whole experiment This work will shine light on controlling the gelation temperature and domain size of SeedGel It will also pave a way to design stimuli-responsive materials with customized structures and properties Figure 1 a Stitched scattering profile of SANS
