 Statements of Research Scientific Importance Spin liquid SL highly correlated and topological magnetic phases that host fractional excitations have attracted great attention since Andersons seminal work in 1970s  Despite there are now several spin liquid candidates such as the YbMgGaO4 on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice  -RuCl3 on the bond frustrated honeycomb lattice  the search for new spin liquid materials is still a key goal in correlated materials research As increasing magnetic frustration stabilizes spin liquids one possible way to find new or more stable spin liquids is to couple together two different frustrated lattices Indeed recent inelastic neutron scattering and SR investigations on the stuffed honeycomb antiferromagnet TbInO3 in which the triangular layers of Tb3 ions are distorted with two inequivalent Tb3 sites see Fig 1a have manifested two-dimensional spin liquid behavior at low temperature 4 No magnetic long-range order transition in TbInO3 was found down to 01 K At the triangular-lattice Brillouin zone boundary the broad gapless magnetic excitations lying at low energies and another broad excitation branch at higher energies up to 42 meV have been observed via inelastic neutron scattering INS Instead of the anisotropic g factor and the low-lying crystal field excitations of Tb3 in TbInO3 the Gd3 ion L  0 J  S  72 in GdInO3 is expected as pure spin magnetism and isotropic g factor One could consider GdInO3 as a classical Heisenberg spin system in the stuffed honeycomb lattice which may display different behavior comparing to TbInO3  It has been proven by a previous theoretical and XRD combined study that GdInO3 has a negative thermal expansion NTE at the 50 K -100 K range  As indicated by the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat the compound undergoes an antiferromagnetic long-range ordering AFM transition 5G5A at 22 K Fig 1b The AFM magnetic structures have been proposed by theoretical calculations and the ground state energies of the different AFM configurations are quite close implying its highly frustrated characteristics  Nonetheless the extrapolated Curie-Weiss temperature 5565J is found to be -50 K giving rise to the large frustration index 5565J 5G5A  28 it is infinite for TbInO3 since it is disordered down to lowest temperature The determination of the magnetic structures related to the two phase-transitions is ongoing As a powerful experimental technique INS measures the dynamical spin structure factor which could directly clarify the spin system states Therefore we propose to perform INS measurement and observe the magnetic excitations of GdInO3 at the temperature below 5G5A The observed the spin wave excitation could be used to refine the exchange interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian and locate the position of the system in the phase diagram Preliminary Work We have successfully grown large isotope single crystals 160GdInO3 the inset of Fig 1b The structures of the crystals have been verified via single crystal X-ray diffraction The susceptibility shows an AFM transition at 22 K  indicated by the specific heat Fig 1b Additional tiny broad peak T2 108 K implying crossover below different spin configurations as observed in Gd2Ti2O7  Inelastic neutron scattering measurement with Ei  8 meV has been performed on the time-of-flight spectrometer SEQUOIA at 16 K and 10 K As shown in Fig 1c we observed the increase of the intensity of peaks 0 -1 2 and 0 1 2 on cooling indicates the formation of a long-range spin ordering probably characterized by a propagation vector k  0 0 0 In the ordered state no significant magnetic INS signal was observed above 3 meV implying that the corresponding spin wave excitations should be below 3 meV as shown in Fig 1d However due to the limitation of the instrument resolution in energy FWHM  016 meV and the lowest temperature reached by a CCR just slightly below the AFM transition at 22 K the clear and sharp spin-wave excitations was not successfully observed Further INS measurements on clod neutron spectrometer are needed to clarify the spin-wave excitations in the AFM ordered state of GdInO3 Figure 1 a Crystal

and 10 K respectively d Inelastic neutron scattering along H 0  direction at 16 K Experiment Plan In order to observe the low-lying magnetic excitations of the two-step ordered antiferromagnet GdInO3 we propose to perform inelastic neutron scattering measurement on the cold neutron multi-axis crystal spectrometer MACS Its proper dynamic range and fine energy resolution FWHM down to 002 meV allow MACS to observe the magnetic excitations below 3 meV In order to reduce the neutron absorption isotope crystal 160GdInO3 around 2 gram will be used and aligned in HHL plane for the proposed measurement The dilution refrigerator is required to cover the three temperature zones T  T1 T2  T  T1 T  T1 from 01 K to 10 K The data sets will be collected at temperature 01 K 15 K 25 K and 10 K to observe the thermal evolution of the magnetic excitations The low temperature data T  01 K will be used to solve the exchange interaction Hamiltonian based on the stuffed honeycomb lattice model Considering 1 day for cooling the temperature to 01 K and 5 days for data collection we request in total 6 days of beam time on MACS to compete the proposed the measurement The work is part of the DOE Early Career Award project Local site magnetic susceptibility for quantum materials by polarized neutron diffraction Safety Considerations We will follow the standard procedures for neutron scattering experiments and the safety protocols of HFIR ORNL References  L Balents Nature 464 08917 2010  S Yao etal Nature 540 559 2016  A Banerjee etal Nat Mater 15 733 2016  L Clark etal Nat Phys 15 262 2019
