Magnetoelectric Effects in Oligomer FerroelectricMetallic Ferromagnetic Heterostructures Magneto-electric coupling both in single phase materials and in differently ordered heterostructures is a rich playground for the investigation of fundamental physics and for possible applications We are interested in investigating ferroelectricferromagnetic heterostructures in which elastic coupling is minimized so that the direct coupling between magnetic and electric order is dominant These conditions are met in polymeroligomer ferroelectric thin films on metallic magnets because of the huge mismatch between the stiffness of the soft polymer Youngs modulus  10 GPa and the metallic ferromagnet with a Youngs Modulus of 200 GPa We have previously observed a strong magnetoelectric coupling  in thin films of a copolymer ferroelectric of 70 vinylidene fluoride with 30 trifluoroethylene PVDF-TrFE overlaid on a Co wedge with out-of-plane anisotropy PMA As the ferroelectric polarization is switched from up to down the magnetic anisotropy of the Co films changes by as much as 50 as shown in figure 1 Magnetoelectric effects in heterostructures are highly sensitive to the interfacial conditions but because the PVDF_TrFE is grown ex-situ in a Langmuir Blodgett trough the interface between the two is poorly defined and almost certainly contaminated with oxides and possibly hydroxides To control the interface we have developed the ability to evaporate short chain ferroelectric oligomers of C2H2F2 in our case n15 in an evaporator connected to a sputtering chamber  The resulting CoVDF interfaces are clean stable for multiple weeks  -and show a complete lack of any magnetoelectric signatures With the insertion of a good dielectric MgO layer magneto-electric signatures in the magnetic hysteresis loops are visible showing a clear difference in the coercive fields for up and down polarization Polarized neutron reflectivity PNR will allow us to probe the depth dependence of the changes in magnetization  with ferroelectric polarization In particular we are interested in the changes in the magnetization of the surface layer of Co due to accumulation of polarization charge at the interface SAMPLE AND EXPERIMENT Figure 1 Change in effective anisotropy as a function of Co thickness with ferroelectric polarization in a PtCoPVDF_TrFE heterostructure Adapted from  8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Co thickness A The sample consist of glassPt20 nm Co25 nmMgO5 nm VDF40-80 nmAl 30 nm with the upper Al electrodes and lower PtCo electrodes at right angles to each other figure 2 The switching of the VDF ferroelectric polarization requires voltages of 20 V and the polarization is remanent for 1 week so we can use a DC power supply to switch the polarization ex-situ 3 Note that we only expect magnetoelectric coupling effects in the regions where the two sets of electrodes overlap The small electrode areas are necessitated by the inability to make cm2 area samples that are impervious to breakdown For the neutron runs we plan to increase the filling factor to close to 50 by designing staggered electrode pads We do not expect neutron interference effects because the electrodes are  1mm in width well above the coherence length Note that we have previously performed successfully PNR measurements at NCNR for a completely different experiment in a sample with Co bars and a filling factor of 50  What signatures do we expect to see in PNR Our experiments indicate that the magnetic anisotropy changes from out-of-plane to in-plane as the ferroelectric polarization is switched from up to down In the conventional geometry for PNR in which the neutrons are polarized parallel to the sample plane we expect to see no difference in the spin up and spin down reflectivity for out-of-plane magnetization due to the boundary condition on B which occurs for ferroelectric polarization pointing up Switching to polarization down the resulting in-plane magnetization will show a difference in spin up and spin down reflectivity At the critical edge this is proportional to the in-plane magnetization Data at higher k may be able to probe the depth dependence of this magnetization change an exciting prospect that is almost impossible to perform with other methods Although sample volume might be a problem background effects should be minimal since the CoPt regions between the Al electrodes will maintain their out-of-plane anisotropy Because we are interested in the remanent magnetization only the minimum field required to maintain the neutron polarization will be necessary during measurements but we will need to use a magnetic field of 3kG to make sure the magnetization is in a single domain state when we start We plan our first set of experiments at saturation values of the ferroelectric polarization both up and down If we observe a significant difference in the neutron spin asymmetry for differing ferroelectric polarizations we will perform subsequent measurements at lower polarization to reveal a quantitative polarization dependence of the magnetization direction Figure 2 Left Layer structure of the ferroelectricferromagnetic heterostructure with electrodes for poling and dielectric layer Right Schematic of crossed electrodes where the darker blue represents the magnetic layer equivalent to a tuning of the electric field at the interface For each measurement we request 12 hours per scanning condition to measure out to a Q value of 012 -1 which is 1 day per value of ferroelectric polarization In order to measure three polarizations states we request three days for this part of the experiment A harder yet potentially rewarding experiment may be possible in a less conventional geometry  in which neutron polarization is perpendicular to the sample plane In this geometry the out-of-plane magnetization will result in differences in the spin-up and spin down reflectivity ie R and R-- In plane magnetization will result in spin flip Hence measurements of all 4 cross sections RR--R- R- will tease out the differences in the magnetization for the two different ferroelectric polarizations In this scenario the background effects from the inactive CoPt area will not contribute to the spin -flip reflectivity which will only be sensitive to the in-plane magnetization Once again we are interested in the remanent magnetization The choice of reflectivity geometry ie conventional vs not will be determined by instrumental background For this experiment in order to measure the additional spin flip channels we request one day of time for each of the two ferroelectric polarizations up and down Therefore we ask for five days of time total to complete both experiments
