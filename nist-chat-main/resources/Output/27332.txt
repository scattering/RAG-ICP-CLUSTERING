Title uSANS Measurements of Deformation Induced Martensite in Steel Many AHSS steels and stainless steels make use of the TRIP effect  The TRIP effect or transformation induced plasticity is a solid-state martensitic phase transformation which results in increased work hardening and tensile strength while delaying fracture These factors then result in additional deformation and energy absorption properties key needs for automotive lightweighting In many steels this phase transformation is a two-step process with a hexagonal close packed e-martensite preceding a body centered cubic or body centered tetragonal a-martensite    However investigation into this transformation is often limited to transmission electron microscopy TEM studies where the sample volume is very small with minimal statistics on the size distribution of the martensite phases We propose to perform uSANS measurements on 8 samples of a 201 stainless steel all expressed as wt  162 Cr 69 Mn 40 Ni 05 Si 03 Cu 02 Mo balance Fe deformed to 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 and 42 engineering strain levels via uniaxial tension uSANS measurements would be performed on these samples with and without a magnetic field applied Portions of these samples were previously measured at NCNR BT8 for phase fraction and crystallographic texture as shown in Figure 1 We will use other portions of the same samples for the proposed tests Figure 1 Phase fractions in the 201 Stainless steel From  uSANS measurements would complement these measurements by providing estimates of the size and shape of the martensites Our measurements at BT8 agree with literature data  that indicate that the e-martensite is the first martensite phase to appear after deformation but at intermediate levels of deformation the phase fraction of e-martensite decreases The uSANS measurements can then be used to help assess the mechanism for the disappearance of the e-martensite phase Some of the hypotheses we will test include  Does the e-martensite phase have a limit in size  Does the e-martensite phase reduce in size as a function of deformation  Is the e-martensite phase consumed by the a-martensite phase To our knowledge SANS techniques have not been attempted in studying the martensitic transformation in steels SANS techniques have been successfully used to investigate precipitation and irradiation damage behavior in steels    Exploratory tests at NCNR uSANS beam time request 25434 indicate there is a strong scattering signal from the different phases in these materials Separating the e-martensite and a-martensite would be difficult with other scattering techniques as the elemental composition is not expected to vary between the phases nor is there a significant difference in unit cell volume However SANS techniques are well suited for these measurements as the e-martensite phase is paramagnetic and the a-martensite is ferromagnetic The initial phase austenite is also paramagnetic but with much larger scattering sizes on the order of the grain size uSANS is requested for this proposal as the initial sizes of the e-martensite and a-martensite phases may start as a few multiples of the size scale of the lattice  1 nm but then rapidly grow to features near the micron scale If successful these measurements will show how the sizes of the martensite phases change as a function of deformation and demonstrate a new application area for SANS techniques  V F Zackey E R Parker D Fahr and R Busch The Enhancement of Ductility in High-Strength Steels ASM Trans Q vol 60 pp 252-259 1967  J Dash and H M Otte The martensite transformation in stainless steel Acta Metall vol 11 pp 1169-1178 Oct 1963  C Gauss I R Souza Filho M J R Sandim P A Suzuki A J Ramirez and H R Z Sandim In situ synchrotron X-ray evaluation of strain-induced martensite in AISI 201 austenitic stainless steel during tensile testing Mater Sci Eng A vol 651 pp 507-516 Jan 2016  Y F Shen X X Li X Sun Y D Wang and L Zuo Twinning and martensite in a 304 austenitic stainless steel Mater Sci Eng A vol 552 pp 514-522 Aug 2012  W Poling Effects of Texture and Austenite Transformation on Mechanical Anisotropy during Uniaxial Tensile Deformation of TRIP-Assisted Sheet Steels presented at the MST 2017 Technical Meeting Pittsburgh PA USA 09-Oct-2017  G Albertini F Carsughi R Coppola F Rustichelli W A H M Vlak and C Van Dijk Microstructural investigation of 12 Cr martensitic steel for NET by means of small angle neutron scattering J Nucl Mater vol 179-181 pp 706-708 Mar 1991  R Coppola C D Dewhurst R Lindau R P May A Mslang and M Valli Polarised SANS study of microstructural evolution under neutron irradiation in a martensitic steel for fusion reactors Phys B Condens Matter vol 345 no 1-4 pp 225-230 Mar 2004  J Van den Bosch et al SANS and TEM of ferritic-martensitic steel T91 irradiated in FFTF up to 184dpa at 413C J Nucl Mater vol 440 no 1-3 pp 91-97 Sep 2013
