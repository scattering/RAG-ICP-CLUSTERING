 1 Solvation in Ionic Liquids with PMMA-Grafted Nanoparticles Statement of Research In this project we explore the ion transport mechanism in ionic liquids with addition of polymer-grafted nanoparticles Our grafted particle system is designed to investigate how polymer coupling and ionic liquid IL mobility will impact effective ion transport in particle assemblies The aim of this proposal is to measure the ionic liquid dynamics in assemblies of polymethyl methacrylate PMMA-grafted iron oxide Fe3O4 nanoparticles when they are mixed with solvents of varying dipole moments We will incorporate PMMA-grafted nanoparticles to imidazolesolvent mixtures and examine how particles of different structures influence the carrier ion dynamics Data from previous beamtime is discussed in prelimary results and now we propose to measure the fast dynamics of cations in ILsolvent mixtures in DCS Scientific Importance Segmental mobility structure and flexibility of polymers and ion aggregation are known to influence the mobility and conductivity of ions in polyelectrolyte systems Non-ionic diblock copolymer morphologies in IL and ionic mobility within hydrophilic phases have been studied in previous studies12 For example 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumbistrifluoromethylsulfonylimide EMIM-TFSI incorporated polystyrene-b-methyl methacrylate diblock copolymer showed that interface and domain orientation affects the ion transport2 In our system IL can associate with grafted PMMA chains through ion-dipole interactions with the addition of right choice of solvent such as acetone and methanol These interactions influence the solvation of IL hence the formation of ion clusters3 Dynamics of HMIM Measured in QENS We synthesized deuterated-PMMA grafted Fe3O4 nanoparticles at two grafting densities for experiments in September 2019 and measured the incoherent scattering from the HMIM cation of HMIM-TFSI in QENS In previous QENS study on d-PMMAEMIM-TFSI system two relaxations measured for the EMIM were attributed to the diffusion of free ions in EMIM-TFSI and to the ions that are associated with PMMA4 and activation energy for the diffusion process of PMMA segments were shown to decrease with increasing IL content4 The slower diffusion process is assigned to the higher Tg of IL when it interacts with PMMA and the faster diffusion is due to the ionic diffusion in bulk IL There is strong dynamic coupling between PMMA and IL such that bound ions move with PMMA We hypothesize that HMIM-TFSI which dynamically couples with grafted PMMA chains a single relaxation of IL will be measured that is slower than the characteristic relaxation for bulk IL Wetting ie miscibility of HMIM-TFSI with rigid grafted chains will depend on the graft density of particles  These findings on cation mobility of IL will allow us to understand the graft density and particle aggregation effects on the ionic conductivity of grafted particle based complex electrolyte systems Preliminary Scattering Results We measured the QENS inelastic data of pure HMIM-TFSI IL and pure zwitterionic liquid ZIL 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazole-2-ylidene borane BMIM-BH3 in our previous beamtime at BASIS BL2-ORNL We tested the PMMA-grafted particles in both IL and ZIL to understand the effect of ion association and dissociation due to ion-dipole coupling between anion and PMMA This was the first QENS experiment where the local translational motion and long-range unrestricted effective relaxations were compared for the protic and aprotic zwitterionic ionic liquid5 Data was analyzed with two-Lorentzian model fits and the slow and fast process relaxations were fit to a jump-diffusion model to obtain the characteristic residence time between jumps and effective diffusivities for slow and fast processes Figure 1 2 Steric repulsion of grafted chains stabilizes the particles in ionic liquids through miscibility of HMIM-TFSI and PMMA chains which depends on the grafting density of nanoparticles Local dynamics of the HMIM cations within well-dispersed and aggregated grafted particles was measured in QENS We found that long-range dynamics of the HMIM was enhanced within the dispersed particles and the local constrained dynamics was higher within the close-packed particle structures Additionally the local residence time between jumps were higher in close-packed particles than in dispersed ones We attributed this dynamic behavior of HMIM cations to the confinement effect of particles and also to the possible structuring of HMIM-TFSI within the close-packed particles The counterions do not self-dissociate with this new zwitterionic liquid ZIL hence ionic motions do not couple with the local segmental motions of PMMA The QENS signal results from the simple relaxation processes where ZIL freely diffuse without any interaction with polymers This feature indicated ion transport decoupled from the polymer mobility in polyelectrolytes which is not possible with the current self-associating protic ILs ZIL dynamics was not influenced with particle structures suggesting that zwitter ions did not interact with the PMMA and the confinement of the zwitterionic molecule was less likely to occur due to its homogeneous structure Solvents with larger dipole moment decrease the free energy of solvation and further enhance the ion mobility of ionic liquid6 In recent beamtime we conducted quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments with high-flux backscattering spectrometer HFBS in NCNR Ionic liquid HMIM-TFSI mixed with either deuterated acetonitrile or deuterated methanol 11 wt were prepared to dissolve PMMA-grafted iron oxide nanoparticles with two grafting densities Due to the limited dynamic range in HFBS we only observed one diffusion process for all samples Dynamic was accelerated when HMIM-TFSI mixed with solvents Figure 2a and higher diffusivity was achieved in HMIM-TFSIacetonitrile mixture than in methanol which agrees with the fact that acetonitrile possesses higher dipole moment than methanol to further increase the ionic liquid mobility In order to correlate conductivity with ionic liquid dynamic the solution conductivities were measured in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy We observe higher conductivity for higher grafting density in three solutions Higher density of grafted PMMA has stronger dipolar interaction with TFSI- anion therefore number of free hydrogen-bearing cation increases leading to higher diffusivity and conductivity Figure 1 Lorentzian broadenings of pure HMIM-TFSI and grafted nanoparticles in HMIM-TFSI for fast top and slow bottom processes and jump diffusion model fittings as represented by the lines Effective diffusivities for the localized confined motion fast and long-range unrestricted slow motion TEM data show well-dispersed left and close-packed PMMA-grafted particles right in HMIM-TFSI Scale bar is 50 nm 3 We plan to use the disk chopper spectrometer at NCNR Two dynamic processes were concluded in BASIS while only one can be observed in HFBS due to the limited dynamic range We want to measure and compare the faster dynamic when
