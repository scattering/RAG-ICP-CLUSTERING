Introduction Research in magnetism experiences an increasing interest in topological materials which are robust against external perturbations thanks to the topological protection afforded by the fact that the topological number is invariant under continuous deformations While Skyrmions Hopfions etc are in the focus of most research groups magnetic vortex and antivortex are fascinating due to their stability in nano-scaled elements and their potential in sensor and biomedical application The overall goal of this research is to gain a deep understanding of the nature of topologically protected magnetic states such as vortex and antivortex states and its pre-vortex phase transition states in large-area magnetic nanoparticle arrays Our novel approach is based on the ability to reliably fabricate such ferromagnetic nanoparticle arrays and to characterize their magnetization properties by experiment and simulation Magnetic nanoparticles operating in the vortex configuration are of interest in magnetic field sensors and as magnetic nanoprobes for immunoassay diagnostics In both applications vortex states are found to be more advantageous compared to single-multi-domain magnetization states Typically spin-valve-type sensors switch via multi-domain C- or S-shaped magnetization states and therefore often exhibit an open non-linear hysteresis curve Improvements in the functionality of these sensors can be achieved by extending the linearity of the curve and reducing the hysteretic effects see Fig 1  In this study we consider a different approach by using elliptically-shaped elements exhibiting a vortex magnetization state like that previously studied by our collaborators from Danube University Krems in circular nanodisks 2 The vortex is one of the fundamental magnetization ground states occurring in disk-shaped thin film elements and is characterized by minimization of the demagnetizing energy at the expense of exchange energy The state is described as free of hysteresis and planar stray-fields and it is discussed as a potential oscillator in spin-torque systems memory bits and magnetic field sensors Detailed characterization of the depth-dependent magnetization the intra-disk magnetic structure and the coupling among the elements in the nanodisk array can be obtained using GISANS and reflectometry but only an off-specular probe such as GISANS can measure the magnetic structures whose net in-plane magnetization is zero Sample and Desired Outcome Sputter-deposited layer stacks with a CoFeB free layer with thicknesses varying between 30 and 80 nm have been processed to elliptically shaped disks of about 200x400 nm2 in size using nanoimprint lithography and lift-off techniques An external field applied along the shorter ellipse axis causes an orthogonal vortex core shift either left or right from the current flow direction depending on the vortex rotation sense giving rise to a change in the magnetoresistive signal A clear vortex signature is found in the major loop hysteresis with nucleation annihilation fields of 20-30 mT up to 80-100 mT depending on the free layer thickness and disk diameter Fig 2 These findings have been confirmed in the framework of the semi-analytical rigid-vortex-model  and micromagnetic simulations with OOMMF  In the present study we will concentrate on the identification of the magnetic vortex state via GISANS in an CoFeB elliptical nanodisk array with dimensions and shapes shown in the schematic drawing of the master stamp for nanoimprint lithography NIL in Fig 3 The structured sample has a size of 1 x 1 cm2 Fig 4 The best field conditions for the vortex state will be determined in advance using magnetoresistive hysteresis loop measurements and by VSM We previously performed polarized neutron reflectivity measurements on MAGIK on a comparable array of elliptical CoFeB elements Aim of the experiment was to verify that vortices can directly be detected by PNR As can be seen in Fig 5 for a measurement at a very low magnetic field of 15 mT in which a vortex state should be present clearly spin-flip scattering - and -  can be detected The appearance of spin-flip scattering is expected as a sign for a vortex state as the coherence range along the y-direction is smaller than the width of the vortices For fitting the data several sample regions must be defined and then added incoherently in the fitting routine as demonstrated previously  Figure 6 shows a schematic drawing of the vortex array including an average spin orientation with the core being assumed to be centered While the magnetic moments of the center parts blue range in Fig 6a cancel out within the neutron coherence range a net moment within each coherence range covering the top and or bottom parts of the ellipses appears green ranges in Fig 6b As these moments are along the horizontal x-axis and perpendicular to the applied field axes along the vertical y-axis this causes spin-flip scattering in low magnetic fields as expected Analysis of these data are in progress with a focus on obtaining the depth dependence of the vortex Unfortunately the off-specular scattering was weak and we were unable to extract any significant information about the in-plane structure of the magnetization within each ellipse Proposed Experiments The Q-range available on vSANS should allow us to access several diffraction peaks associated with the in-plane structure To obtain information about the nature of the in-plane vortex structure measurements at the vSANS instrument will be performed in GISANS geometry on an elliptical nanodisk stripe array using the Titan electromagnet applied fields of 0001 T to 01 T We propose measurements of the patterned sample at three different fields along the hysteresis loop below the vortex state in the vortex state and in saturation with increasing field after saturation in negative field and at the vortex state when coming from saturation at positive field Each condition will require approximately two days of beamtime for a total of six days All measurements will be made with full polarization analysis where the spin-flip SF scattering is necessary to uniquely identify the non-collinear moments associated with vortices Moreover the spin-flip scattering in GISANS geometry has been shown capable of identifying any net chirality across the vortices The expected cylindrical shell SF scattering will persist to a much larger Q that the particle-to-particle Bragg peaks with the first Bragg peak at 00016 -1 VSANS is an ideal location for this measurements due to high count rate and one-shot measurement with two detectors the high polarization of the polarizing optics almost perfect supper mirror and RF flipper at 8   no measurable depolarization regions within the 3He spin analyzer and the ability to access the lowest available Q-range VSANS with full polarization in comparison to NG7 SANS where a minimum of two guides are required Specifically at 8  with the vertical upstream collimation a middle detector distance of 17 m and 0 to 1 guide we should be able to measure and resolve Qs as low as 00012 -1 References  T Wurft W Raberg K Prgl A Satz G Reiss H Brckl Appl Phys Lett 115 132407 2019  H Weitensfelder et al PhysRev Applied 10 054056 2018  J Zimmer et al US Patent App 14141660 2015  K Theis-Brhl et al ACS Appl Mater Interfaces 2018 10 5 5050  K Y Guslienko et al Phys Rev B 65 2001  D A Gilbert et al Nature Communications 6 8462 2015
