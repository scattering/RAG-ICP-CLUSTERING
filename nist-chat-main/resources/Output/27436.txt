Page 1 of 2 Investigate the magnetic chirality in new multiferroic NiCo2TeO6 Scientific Importance Multiferroics that simultaneously exhibit ferroelectric and magnetic orders have attracted much attention due to their intriguing physics and potential applications1  Central to their interest has been the nature of the competing magnetic interactions and their coupling to the ferroelectric degree of freedom termed as the magnetoelectric ME coupling1  Recently we successfully synthesized a new multiferroic single crystal NiCo2TeO6 NCTO The magnetic moment vs temperature see Fig 1A exhibits an AFM transition at 50 K and the magnetic moment vs magnetic field shows a transition near 4 T below 50 K see Fig 1B Furthermore a non-zero electric polarization Pc emerges below the AFM transition temperature 50 K see Fig 1C and the Pc exhibits very strong magnetic field dependence see Fig 1D suggesting the strong ME coupling effect in NCTO Our neutron diffraction of NCTO powder samples reveals that the NCTO may have an incommensurate k  0 1 02027 chiral magnetic structure with spins aligned in the ab plane see Fig 2 at 4 K Understanding the strong ME coupling in NCTO requires the investigation of its magnetic chirality However the confirmation of chiral magnetic structure requires the experiments using polarized neutron scattering method Hence we propose to perform polarized neutron scattering experiments at BT7 Triple axis spectrometer Preliminary Work Figure 1 A Magnetic moment vs temperature under various magnetic field for a NCTO single crystal B Magnetic moments vs magnetic field at various temperature C Electric polarization along c direction Pc vs temperature under various magnetic field D Pc vs magnetic field at various temperature Magnetic fields were applied parallel to the ab plane during all measurements Inset of C shows one photo of our NCTO single crystals scale bar 1 mm We have studied the magnetic moments and electric polarizations for our NCTO single crystals Fig 1A illustrates the magnetic moments as a function of temperature an AFM transition was seen around 50 K Fig 1B shows the magnetic moments vs magnetic field at various temperature A magnetic-field induced transition was seen around 4 T below the AFM ordering temperature As shown in Fig 1C a non-zero electric polarization Pc emerges below the AFM transition temperature 50 K The Pc exhibits very strong magnetic field dependence as shown in Fig 1D suggesting the colossal ME coupling effect in NCTO Page 2 of 2 Figure 2 A Neutron powder diffraction and refinement patters for a NCTO powder sample at 4 K at zero magnetic field B The refined magnetic structure shown in a unit cell of NCTO C the projection of the magnetic structure on the ab plane D the magnetic structure shown in 5 unit cells along c direction We also performed neutron powder diffraction for NCTO The results reveal that the NCTO may have an incommensurate k  0 1 02027 helical magnetic structure with spins aligned in the ab plane see Fig 2 To determine the magnetic chirality we need to perform polarized neutron scattering The results would help in a better understanding of the colossal ME coupling effect in NCTO Choice of Instrument We need high-resolution polarized neutron scattering data to clearly determine magnetic signatures of our single crystals BT7 is a suitable instrument for our purpose Experiment Plan We propose to study the magnetic chirality of NCTO by performing polarized neutron scattering experiments as a function of temperature High quality single crystals typical size 3 mm  3 mm  2 mm  50 mg have been synthesized We plan to measure 7 temperature points for each sample with T  200 K 60 K 50 K 40 K 20 K 10 K and 15 K crossing the AFM transition We request a total of 3 days to look at these scans for the good statistical accuracy including the time for sample loading and cooling Response to Previous Panel This is a new submission Safety Considerations Samples are stable and all measurements are safe References  W Eerenstein N D Mathur and J F Scott Nature 442 7592006  S -W Cheong and M Mostovoy Nat Mater 6 132007
