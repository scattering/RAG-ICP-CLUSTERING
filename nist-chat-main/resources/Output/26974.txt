Metal-Organic Framework Ligand Dynamics and Interactions with Ionic Liquid Scientific background Supercapacitors which electrosorb ions onto electrode interfaces with high specific surface areas under an applied electric field offer high energy and power densities The dynamics of co-ions and counterions in confined pores critically influence the capacitance chargedischarge dynamics and electrochemical stabilities of these energy storage devices While porous carbons had accounted for most porous electrode architectures in the past their limited specific surface areas place a finite maximum on the attainable performance of resulting supercapacitors Furthermore electrode chemistries beyond carbon may facilitate rapid surface charge transfer redox reactions and add pseudocapacitive contributions to total charge accumulation While these capabilities may drastically boost the energy storage capabilities of such devices they also unlock many new electrolyte dynamics and interactions at the ionelectrolyte interfaces Fundamental insight into these processes is an essential component of efforts to control and optimize these novel porous supercapacitor systems Metal-organic frameworks MOFs which are a class of crystalline highly porous materials that consist of coordination bonds between transition-metal cations and multidentate organic linkers show promise as a novel electrode material system that can provide breakthrough energy storage capabilities1 These particles contain internal well-ordered porosities and offer high surface areas in excess of 1500 m2g Numerous MOF chemistries exist and incorporate different metal cluster centers and organic ligand chains Subsequently MOFS can be tailored for different electrolytes in order to maximize charge storage densities ion exchange dynamics and surface redox processes Three main MOFs pose particular promise for this electrochemical energy storage application The first is a cluster of Zr6O4OH4 that uses the organic ligand of 22-bipyridine-55-dicarboxylate bpydc Figure 1a hereafter referred to as Zr-BPYDC The second structure is a cluster of Ni surrounded by a 23671011-hexaiminotriphenylene ligand Figure 1b hereafter referred to as Ni-HATP The third structure is a cluster of CoH2O2H2O that uses an organic structure composed of hexamethylenetetramine Hmt and 2356-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid H2tfbdc Figure 1c hereafter referred to as Co-LMOF The distinct ligand structures of each MOF all exhibit nanoscale dynamics including rotation and vibrational modes which have yet to be observed and analyzed Furthermore the metal clusters and organic ligands of each MOF offer unique interfaces with distinct surface chemistries and electron conductivities Consequently electrosorbed electrolytes are likely to exhibit distinctly different ion dynamics Fundamental insight into the dynamics at the electrolyte-electrode interface will facilitate rapid ion exchange under dynamic conditions and determine electrolyte properties that yield maximum ion packing into dense double layers for electric charge accumulation Furthermore an in-depth probe of the dynamics of the ligands of MOF structures will facilitate electrodeelectrolyte designs that allow rapid and reversible redox reactions and optimize the energy and power densities of resulting pseudocapacitors Figure 1 Schematics of a Zr-BPYDC b Ni-HATP and c Co-LMOF 500 nmACBPrevious quasi-elastic neutron scattering QENS experiments probed the dynamics of room-temperature ionic liquids confined in porous carbon electrodes with different surface chemistries Figure 2 The analysis showed that surface functional groups influenced the mobility and diffusion properties of the confined molecules2 MOFs offer more robust electrode chemistries that will significantly amplify these effects Furthermore the porosity of MOFs is more readily tailored to be in a uniform mesopore regime in turn a larger fraction of confined ions will obtain sufficient space for translational and rotational motion and maximize the quasi-elastic signal Finally MOF synthesis pathways allow for deuteration of the structure which will in turn decouple dynamics from the electrolyte and the electrode and yield critical insights into relaxation and vibrational modes of the organic ligands Objectives This proposed research aims to probe the dynamics of MOF electrodes with ionic liquid confined inside of pores Quasi-elastic scattering will determine the influence of each MOFs structure and chemistry on ion mobility and diffusion This analysis will also derive key molecular dynamic properties for the ligands in the MOFs themselves These fundamental insights will correlate with our ongoing NMR characterization DFT calculations and electrochemistry experiments to deliver breakthrough discoveries about this energy storage system Proposed experiment We propose to conduct QENS measurements on seven different systems System 1 is the Zr-BPYDC MOF system 2 is the Ni-HATP MOF system 3 is the Co-LMOF MOF Systems 4-6 are corresponding MOFs with pores 100 filled with the EmIm-TFSI room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte System 7 will be the neat EmIm-TFSI To differentiate between the dynamics of the electrode and electrolyte the organic ligands of the MOFs will be deuterated Each system will be loaded into aluminum cans We will perform the fixed window scan FWS of each sample as a diagnostic tool to resolve the onset of the dynamics as a function of temperature QENS spectra will be collected at 300 K room temperature We will also measure the resolution from each sample at 4 K along with vanadium standard for data normalization QENS measurements will be calculated for 062 -1  Q  168 -1 These results will be coupled with corresponding NMR and electrochemistry measurements and DFT calculations We plan to conduct the same experiments on the Disc Chopper Spectrometer DCS to analyze the fast dynamics of these systems Beam time request We will have 7 samples in total along the resolution measurement Each measurement will require 6 hours We request 6 days of beam time on the HFBS to accommodate all measurements Data treatment The data will be analyzed using segmented dynamics andor a two-component model utilized previously for ionic liquids3 We will rely on a Gaussian approximation to quantify elastic intensity by a Debye-Waller factor DWF to derive mean-square displacement Summary The proposed work will investigate the dynamics of ionic liquid electrolyte confined inside of different MOF electrode structures This information will provide essential fundamental insights into the structure of the MOFs and interactions at the electrodeelectrolyte interface of these energy storage systems The
