Protein based pharmaceuticals have gained significant attention in recent years The protein drug substance is typically frozen often for months to years before it is manufactured as a solution or freeze-dried drug product These drug substances are not sufficiently stable in the solution state at room temperature to meet the shelf-life requirements Thus freezing and freeze-drying are two processes encountered during the use and manufacture of these proteins For these products to retain their therapeutic activity it is necessary to maintain the protein in its native structure during the entire freezing and thawing process Stresses encountered during the processes of freezing and thawing - such as cold denaturation change in pH and increase in ionic strength are known to cause protein denaturation1 Additionally there is a large body of evidence suggesting loss in protein activity due to its adsorption at the ice-water and ice-air interfaces which might partially lead to protein unfolding 2 Biopharmaceutical formulations are multicomponent systems and contain several additives referred to as excipients These include sugars sugar-alcohols buffers and surfactants each with an intended role functionality in the formulation Excipients eg trehalose play a major role in stabilizing protein formulations In order to exert their function these compounds have to be amorphous and resist crystallization phase separation It is well known that during freezing selective crystallization of a buffer component can lead to pH shifts Many studies have indirectly shown that pH change can be detrimental to protein stability We had reported using synchrotron radiation trehalose phase separation crystallization in frozen solutions3 These results were surprising because it was widely believed that trehalose remained amorphous during the freeze-drying process Crystallization of trehalose appeared to be responsible for its inability to prevent monoclonal antibody aggregation A combination of excipients to protect a drug substance throughout its shelf-life is a central theme to develop robust biopharmaceutical formulations In spite of advancements both in analytical techniques and in molecular modelling there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the stresses experienced by the protein in the frozen state Understanding protein aggregation with respect to adsorption at the ice interfaces or due to solute crystallization is necessary and of critical interest to the pharmaceutical community To develop a robust formulation it is important to identify and quantify the major phase transitions with respect to individual solutes Baseline experiments characterizing the protein and excipient phase behavior - i partial or complete crystallization ii glass transition iii protein aggregation DLS or SEC and iv solute and ice melting will be systematically evaluated These studies during both freezing and thawing will be conducted using low-temperature DSC and XRD Thus the characterization of the protein and excipients using a battery of complementary techniques will enable a comprehensive characterization of the entire formulation Although it is well established that a cryoprotectant must be amorphous to stabilize proteins in the frozen state the exact nature of the protective mechanism has been a topic of debate In our first set of experiments Proposal 26096 we investigated the effect of buffer crystallization during freeze-thawing on a model protein lactate dehydrogenase LDH MW 140 KDa which exists as a tetramer in the native state in sodium phosphate buffer in the absence and presence of trehalose The contrast variation technique allowed unambiguous determination of the aggregation state of the protein in the frozen as well as solution state The crystal structure of LDH from the protein databank was used as a reference to obtain the SANS pattern4 LDH aggregated irreversibly after a single freeze-thaw cycle Fig 1A The scattering from ice in the absence of protein resulted mainly from the contrast between the ice and air interfaces eg due to cracks in the ice Thus the scattering is completely eliminated if the ice consisting of 92 H2O and 8 D2O ie the scattering match point for air A change in the native tetrameric structure of the protein was observed starting at  -10C SANS in perfect agreement with the temperature of buffer salt crystallization based on XRD Fig 1B The selective crystallization of disodium hydrogen phosphate during cooling caused a pH shift of 19 units from 70 to 51 Fig 1C in the freeze concentrate Trehalose in spite of remaining amorphous during the freeze-thaw cycle was unable to provide cryoprotection to LDH Thus the pH shift appeared to be responsible for the loss in protein activity Figure 1 Protein-excipient characterization during freeze-thaw based on A SANS patterns of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer  LDH 1 mgmL  2 wv trehalose in 8 D2O buffer where the scattering from the ice-air interface is matched out B Low temperature XRD for 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer during freezing -10 to -40C C Low temperature pH measurements for 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer  2 wv trehalose LDH aggregation is a disturbing and important result since the concentration of phosphate buffer 10 mM is in the range used in commercial formulations It is particularly surprising since it is known to be stable in the pH range of 5 to 7 Moreover trehalose should have served as an effective cryoprotectant Yet our results suggest protein adsorption at the ice-air or ice-freeze concentrate interface5 Our current proposal has two main objectives i Confirm the role of pH shift in protein aggregation This will be accomplished by studying the aggregation behavior in presence of a noncrystallizing buffer histidine If no aggregation is observed in the histidine buffered system then the change in protein structure can be categorically attributed to the pH shift due to buffer crystallization However if the protein continues to be unstable to freezethaw stress the stress induced by protein adsorption at the ice-freeze concentrate interface is the likely mechanism of destabilization ii Determine the influence of surfactant on the protein stability Since surfactants are known to be effective at very low concentrations 001-005 ww polysorbate 80 will be used in this range67 We propose to study the effect of freezingthawing in lactate dehydrogenase LDH from rabbit muscle The excipients will be sugar trehalose buffer histidine and the surfactant The proposed sample compositions are 1 LDH 2 mgmL 2 LDH  trehalose 2 ww 3 LDH  polysorbate 80 001 ww all the 3 samples in histidine buffer and 4 LDH  polysorbate 80  trehalose in sodium phosphate buffer In all four cases the solutions will be buffered with histidine pH 6 The samples will be made in both 8 D2O where the scattering from the ice-air interface is matched out and 95-100 D2O where scattering from the ice-air interface is significant but where the incoherent background is low and features related to the packing of the protein in the freeze-concentrate if present can be observed at higher q values XRD pH DSC and light scattering measurements will be performed prior to SANS measurements The closed cycle refrigerator that will be used for the sample measurements can hold two samples in standard SANS demountable cells with Ti windows Therefore two samples will be measured simultaneously Temperature-dependent SANS measurements will be performed on the samples in 8 and 100 D2O buffers Scans will start at room temperature and then the temperature will slowly be lowered to -40 C in  10C increments at 05Cmin A typical temperature scan for example would be 20 10 5  0 -5 -10 -20 and -40C The sample would then be heated back to room temperature following a similar protocol Scans at each temperature will take 05 hours per sample with additional time needed to reach each temperature at the prescribed cooling rate Based on our previous measurements at the NGB30m SANS instrument the total counting time is 23 hours for the complete cooling-heating cycle for the two samples This includes time for setup and measurement of the empty cells as well as sample changes We are therefore requesting 4 days of beam time on the NGB30m SANS to measure the eight samples described above The reduced data from samples in the liquid state would be analyzed using standard Guinier analysis and molecular modeling As the protein becomes more concentrated during freezing the structure factor will be fit using a hard-sphere screened Coulomb or other appropriate potential The low-q scattering observed in the frozen state will be analyzed using standard power-law analysis
