Page 1 of 2 Statement of Research Scientific Importance The two-dimentional Shastry-Sutherland SSL model consisting of an orthogonal dimer network of spin S12 represents one of the very few topologies where the ground state of a geometrical frustrated lattice could be exactly solved The competition between the intra-dimer J and inter-dimer J exchange interactions lead to the following ground states Fig 1 a gapped spin singlet state for JJ  069 an antiferromagnetically AF ordered state for JJ  085 and a conjectured plaquette state for intermediate JJ1- As an experimental realization of the SSL model the SrCu2BO32 SCBO provides the ideal test ground for the understanding of the quantum magnetism The ratio of the exchange parameters of the compound lie right below the critical value of JJ  069 enabling the transition from the gapped spin singlet state to the plaquette state and subsequently the AF order by experimentally attainable tuning parameters such as application of pressure While the gapped spin dimer state and the AF order at both ends of the phase diagram are well known the nature of the conjectured plaquette state remains elusive Here we propose to study SCBO at its plaquette state with neutron diffraction experiment in magnetic fields as a continuation of our preliminary experiments Important clues could be gained to unlock the nature of this intermediate plaquette phase Preliminary Work It is clear from our previous published work that the hydrostatic pressure is an effective tool to tune the relative exchange interaction strength JJ and drive the system across the different ground states 1- As shown in Fig 1 two subsequent quantum phase transition is expected and indeed was observed in our high-pressure scattering experiments Upon applying pressure the energy gap between the singlet ground state and the triplet excitation is suppressed and continuously disappears at P  2 GPa signaling a second order quantum phase transition  At an even higher pressure P  45 GPa a second quantum phase transition occurs as the plaquette state gives way to an AF ordered state1 A discontinuous decrease in the lattice constant across this transition suggests a first-order structural transition possibly as a result of the spin-lattice coupling It is noted that nature of these transitions has been argued to be exactly the opposite in a recent inelastic neutron scattering study ie first-order transition from the spin singlet state to the plaquette state and second-order transition from the plaquette state to the AF ordered state A crucial question here is the nature of the plaquette state and its magnetization profile which is exactly what we plan to address with our proposed experiment Additionally our recent high-field magnetization measurements have revealed emergence of magnetization anomalies in the plaquette state suggesting an emergent magnetic superstructure at fields as low as 7 T We have also been trying to gain deeper understanding of the plaquette state through collaboration with Prof Mila and Prof Corboz Promising preliminary results for this project have been obtained at In prior experiments signatures of magnetism of an unknown nature have been observed Fig 2 As seen in Fig 2 a an intensity peak appears at 22 The large increase of intensity near 33 is a result of the copper scattering ring coming from the copper-beryllium pressure cell The observed 22 peak in Fig 2a appears to be a magnetic peak a clear magnetic field dependence of which however could not be identified in the prior experiment Fig 2 b shows a partially consistent picture additional magnetic spectral weight at 22 which seems to have a magnetic field dependence This result to a certain extent is indeed surprising as neither the spin-dimer singlet state nor the four-spin plaquette state is expected to be magnetic To probe the nature of this magnetic peak we will need to conduct neutron diffraction experiment with 1 much better statistics and 2 a much large Q-space Choice of Instrument The excellent signal-to-noise ratio and large Q-coverage make BT7 an ideal instrument for the magnetic diffraction studies that are urgently needed to confirm the peculiar magnetic structure in our sample The sample environment low temperature high magnetic fields and high pressure also meets the requirement for our study Page 2 of 2 Experiment Plan We propose to carry out a neutron diffraction experiment on SCBO at high pressure plaquette state to further investigate the nature of the intermediate plaquette state in particular the magnetic structure that we observed in our preliminary experiments Magnetic fields up to  7 T will be needed to resolve the inconsistency of our preliminary low-statistics data as well as to probe potential evidence of the triplet bound state suggested both in our calculation and in a recent inelastic neutron experiment at ambient pressure  These results along with the on-going calculations will improve our understanding of the nature of the plaquette state thus emergent novel state in quantum magnetism in general Our high-quality single crystal SCBO sample prepared with 999 11B isotope is already loaded in a modified Cu-Be pressure cell with a pressure  25 GPa where the system is expected to be in a plaquette state The use of the same sample in the same pressure cell will help us to compare with our preliminary results A base temperature of less than 03 K and magnetic fields up to  7 T will be needed Experiments will be performed at base temperature as function of magnetic field We will cover high Q range such along H0 and 0K direction We estimate that such a complete investigation will require 8 days of beam time Safety Considerations Samples are non-toxic non-corrosive and non-radioactive Gloves should be worn as a precaution References  Haravifard et al PNAS 109 2286 2012  Haravifard et al PNAS 111 14372 2014  Haravifard et al Nat Comun 7 11956 2016
