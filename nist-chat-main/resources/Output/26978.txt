Partially deuterated cellulose derivatives for contrast matching experiments Cellulose based polymers are widely used in industrial applications as flow modifiers in food products cosmetics or oil-drilling fluids or as complexing agents for drug delivery1 Compared to common synthetic polymers which are usually derived from fossil fuels cellulose derivatives are synthesised from renewable or waste resources such as wood recycled paper or food waste The economic importance of cellulose-based polymers is forecasted to rapidly increase in the next decades with bio-polymer production expected to triple from 2011 to 20202 Of the various available starting products from the earths biomass cellulose is the most promising candidate to replace synthetic polymers3 For applications requiring solubility in water cellulose ethers are the most important class of cellulose derivatives Despite their industrial importance and projected growth structural studies of cellulose derivatives in solution remain challenging Cellulose derivatives partially aggregate in water and other protic solvents and these aggregates dominate the low-q scattering signal Beyond the overlap concentration polymers interpenetrate and even in the absence of aggregation studying single chain conformations is an intricate problem For synthetic polymers this hurdle can be overcome with relative ease by use of D-labelling Under certain conditions known as zero-average contrast ZAC single chain conformations can be measured for concentrated systems D-labelling has led to major milestones in polymer science such as the confirmation of the reptation mechanism or the Gaussian conformation of chains in melts Unfortunately cellulose cannot be easily produced in deuterated form and as result no deuterated cellulose derivative is commercially available Cellulose derivatives are produced by replacing hydrogen in the -OH groups of the cellulose monomer see Fig 1 by the required substituent The number of substituents per glucose ring is known as the degree of substitution DS and can take a maximum value of 3 The synthesis of cellulose derivatives is complicated by the fact that cellulose is insoluble in most solvents Reactions must be carried out under strong alkaline conditions or in ionic liquids Once a derivative is obtained subsequent modification is comparatively easier since the precursor is soluble in some common solvents A particularly simple modification is acetylation achieved by reacting a given cellulose derivative with acetic anhydride As an example carboxymethyl cellulose NaCMC is obtained by reacting cellulose with chloroacetic acid shown in Fig 2a Acetylation is carried out by reacting the acid form HCMC with a mixture of acetic anhydride and acetic acid The procedure in Fig 2a-b is representative of the synthesis and acetylation of most cellulose ethers Acetylated versions of cellulose derivatives show enhanced solubility in organic solvents but only minor conformational changesA Using deuterated reagents in the first step of Fig 2 can be used to obtain deuterated cellulose derivatives but D-cellulose is not available commercially and its synthesis expensive and time-consuming Other reagents are either unavailable in deuterated form andor are prohibitively expensive An alternative route is to consider cellulose derivatives with mixed substitution for example the reaction product of Fig 2b which contains both acetyl and carboxymethyl substituents In this approach only the HD content of the acetyl groups is varied Acetylation of cellulose can be carried out with deuterated reagents at relatively low cost 150gram of polymer We show below that the variation of HD content introduced via acetyl groups is sufficient to perform contrast matching experiments Table 1 compiles the coherent scattering lengths and partial molar volumes of NaCMC and its H- and D-acetylated derivatives Using a mixture of H and D polymers with number fractions FH and 1- FH in a solvent with X fraction of deuterated molecules the zero-average contrast condition is achieved for FHbHm-1-FHbmD  0 1 with bm  bp - bsvpvs where bp and bs are the SLDs of the polymer and solvent and vp and vs are their partial molar volumes The scattering intensity of a polymer solution is Iq  rbm2Sq 2 where r is the number density of monomers and Sq is the structure factor which contains both intrachain and interchain contributions for full contrast measurements and only intrachain contributions for the ZAC condition The bm2 values listed in Table 2 demonstrate that full contrast and ZAC experiments are feasible for the acetylated versions of NaCMC Other derivatives MC HEC yield similar values For reference polystyrene in toluene under ZAC conditions with FH  05 gives bm2 1300 The procedure outlined in Fig 2a-b is representative of the synthesis and acetylation of most cellulose ethers Acetylated versions of cellulose derivatives show enhanced solubility in organic solvents but only minor conformational changes Using deuterated reagents in the first step of Fig 2 could in principle be a possible route to obtaining deuterated cellulose derivatives but two problems arise 1 deuterated cellulose is not available commercially its synthesis is possible by bacteria grown in deuterated media but this approach is costly and time-consuming 2 most common substituents are either una ailable in deuterated form andor are prohibitively expensive An alternative route is to consider cellulose deri atives with mixed ubstitution an example of which was given n the react on product of Fig 2b which contains both acetyl and carboxymethyl substituen s In this approach only the HD content of the acetyl groups is varied Ac tylation of cellulos can b carried out with deuterated reagents at relatively low cost 100-200gram of final polymer We show below that the variation of HD content ntroduced via acetyl groups is sufficient to perform contrast matching experiments Table 1 compiles the coherent scattering lengths and partia molar volumes of a comm rcial NaCMC grade and its acetylated derivatives using both H nd D substitution Using a mixture of H and D polym rs with number fractions FH and 1- FH in a ixture of HD solvent the zero-average contrast condition under which the scattering signal of a solution is proportional to the single chain form factor is achieved for FHbHm-1-FHbmD  0 1 with bm  bp - bsvpvs where bp and bs are the scattering length densities of the polymer and solvent and vp and vs are their partial molar volumes The scattering intensity of a polymer solution is Iq  rbm2Sq 2 where r is the number density of monomers Sq is the structure factor which contains both intrachain and interchain contributions for full contrast measurements and only intrachain contributions under the ZAC condition The contrast factors listed in Table 2 demonstrate that full contrast and ZAC experiments are feasible for the acetylated versions of NaCMC Other derivatives MC HEC or HMPC yield similar values For reference the contrast factor for polystyrene in toluene under ZAC conditions with FH  05 is bm2 1300 An obvious shortcoming of the route outlined is that it does not allow the direct study of common cellulose ethers in solution but we expect their acetylated versions to retain many of their original properties1 including large intrinsic rigidity backbone amphiphilicity and marginal swelling due to excluded volume 1 b v NaCMC 563 142 H-AcNaCMC 587 178 D-AcNaCMC 142 178 NaCMC H-AcNaCMC D-AcNaCMC bm2 full 9100 17000 25000 bm2 ZAC -
