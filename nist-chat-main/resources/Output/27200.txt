Understanding the magnetism in photo-spin voltaic PtMnYIG films Background The photovoltaic effect is a well-understood phenomenon most notably in semiconductors where photons are able to excite electrons into the conduction band When this occurs at a PN junction holes and electrons separate and an internal electric field develops Recent materials have recently been observed to generate spin polarized photocurrents also called the photo-spin voltaic effect  This is particularly attractive for spintronic applications which aim to utilize the electron spin either in lieu of or in addition to the electron charge The ability to produce spin polarized currents is vital to spintronic applications but current methods are relatively impractical for technological adoption as they require microwave stimulation spin pumping or temperature gradients across thin films spin Seebeck effect The ability to use light as a method of inducing a spin current could provide a path towards more practical spintron devices with reduced power consumption The photo-spin voltaic effect was first identified in non-magnetic metalmagnetic insulator bilayers with most studies focusing on PtY3Fe5O12 yittrium iron garnet or YIG  While the electron excitation mechanism is similar to the photovoltaic effect in semiconductors for PtYIG the electron excitation is different for different electron spins leading to a spin voltage at the PtYIG interface and a corresponding spin current across the Pt layer Later studies on PtYIG which include one of the proposals authors identified another novel phenomenon photo-magnetoresistance which was observed as an anisotropic magnetoresistance that varies as a function of light intensity  This leads to a model where a magnetic order parameter exists outside the YIG layer and decays into the Pt with light changing the magnetic profile across the interface The ability to increase the magnetic moment within this interfacial zone is a potential avenue to develop optically tunable magnetic sensors Aim We propose to use polarized neutron reflectometry PNR to determine the magnetic depth profile of PtMnYIG bilayers where PtMn is an antiferromagnetic metal and YIG a magnetic insulator Like the similar PtYIG systems PtMnYIG also demonstrates a photo-spin current under illumination from visible light We have recently performed a study on this effect as a function of PtMn layer thickness  Plots of open-circuit voltage measured in-plane across the sample under visible light are shown in Fig 1 Fig 1 a shows the effect of a magnetic field also applied in-plane perpendicular to the transport measurement direction The voltage remains relatively constant with the applied field magnitude and the voltage polarity flips when the field direction is reserved Both behaviors are expected for the photo-spin voltaic effect  There is also a correlation between observed voltage and PtMn thickness with the voltage increasing as the layer thickness decreases Light penetration into the bilayer also increases with decreasing PtMn thickness which likely plays a role in explaining this Fig 1 Open-circuit voltage across a PtMnYIG bilayer a as a function of applied magnetic field and b as a function of PtMn thickness  Previous results on PtYIG indicate the formation of interfacial ferromagnetic moments which give rise to the difference in excitation energy for different electron spins  This was further in Ref 2 which used magnetotransport studies to model a magnetic proximity effect between the Pt and YIG PtMnYIG differs from these photo-spin voltaic bilayers as most other reported systems using a non-magnetic metallic layer on top of YIG rather than an antiferromagnet As such it is a promising system for antiferromagnetic spintronics Here we aim to understand the magnetic properties of the system particularly at the PtMnYIG interface in order to determine the role of interfacial coupling how the interfacial magnetism and to further clarify the role interfacial magnetism may play in the photo-spin voltaic properties observed We also will look at the magnetic depth profile as a function of PtMn layer thickness to understand what role that variable plays in determining the magnitude of the photo-spin voltaic effect Proposed Experiment The main area of interest for this study is to obtain magnetic depth profiles for PtMnYIG bilayer as a function of temperature As the PtMn layer is quite thin 2 nm compare to the 5 m thick YIG layer we may be limited in how much information we can obtain about the magnetic profile across that layer specifically however we are also interested in determining the effect of the layer coupling on the thicker YIG particularly how far the coupling goes into the YIG layer Interfacial exchange especially when modified by RKKY coupling can determine magnetic properties over a relatively large distance 10s of nm If this effect moderated the YIG magnetism on a large scale this would be more accessible with PNR studies We first plan to obtain magnetic depth profiles in saturation above and below the PtMn blocking temperature for both field-cooled and zero-field-cooled conditions for two samples with different PtMn layer thicknesses 27 nm and 16 nm corresponding to the thickest and thinnest PtMn layers in preliminary measurements We will first measure the samples at room temperature at 1 kOe Then we will lower the temperature both under zero applied field and under a 100 Oe cooling field before taking another saturation measurement at 10 K Since the measurements will be in the saturation condition we expect that we will not see a spin flip signal and measuring just the R-- and R spin channels will be sufficient at each condition The samples are 1 cm x 1 cm in area We anticipate needing 12 hours per scanning condition plus time to load align and coolwarm the samples Therefore we estimate 2 days per sample and request 4 days of beam time Preliminary Results The PtMn layer is polycrystalline with an fcc structure and an average grain sized of 48 nm X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to perform an elemental depth profile not shown which is in agreement with cross-sectional TEM and can be used to determine appropriate nuclear scattering length densities for PNR analysis Photo-spin voltaic measurements were performed as described above and shown in Fig 1 PtMnYIG bilayers clearly demonstrate a spin-polarized photocurrent the magnitude of which is increases with decreasing PtMn thickness Fig 2 TEM images

thicknesses 16 - 27 nm A 5 m thick YIG single crystal layer was prepared by liquid phase epitaxy on 111 Gadolinium Gallium Garnet wafers  The PtMn was subsequently deposited on top of the YIG using dual ion beam sputter deposition Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the bilayers and single films of PtMn and are shown in Fig 2 The in-plane magnetic properties of the PtMnYIG bilayers were measured from 10 K to 300 K using SQUID magnetometry The resulting measurements demonstrated in-plane hysteresis with zero coercivity indicating a ferromagnetic state of the YIG layer with a coercive field of 3 mT as is shown in Fig 3 a for a 27 nm PtMn bilayer The magnetic susceptibility was measured below 300 K The magnetic susceptibility response as a function of temperature was recorded during zero-field ZFC and field cooled FC magnetizations of the PtMnYIG bilayers measured in 100 Oe for a XX nm thick PtMN layer is shown in Fig 3 b The PtMnYIG bilayer has a low blocking temperature of around  205 K for 27 nm PtMn which is below the blocking temperature of fcc ordered PtMn phase 653 K  The PtMnYIG bilayer has an elevated blocking temperature of 220 K for 30 s due to the enhance ordering in the FCC PtMn phase Below the blocking temperature as the samples were cooled the anisotropies of the interfacial AF spins were strong enough to get over the thermal fluctuations Fig 3 Magnetic hysteresis loops a and susceptibility as a function of temperature b for 27 nm PtMnYIG References 1 D Ellsworth L Lu J Lan H Chang P Lo Z Wang J Hu B Johnson Y Bian J Xiao
