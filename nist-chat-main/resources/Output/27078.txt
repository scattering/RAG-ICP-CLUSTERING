Neutron scattering in field on a single crystal Eu-based topological magnetic semimetal candidate Takashi Kurumaji Joseph G Checkelsky Department of Physics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jeffrey Lynn NIST Center for Neutron Research Gaithersburg Introduction Realization of magnetic topological states in stoichiometric compounds has the potential to enable an approach to the intrinsic properties of the system and provide a chance to design candidates for higher temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect axion electrodynamics and exotic charge transport phenomena  EuAg4Sb2 is a magnetic topological semimetal candidate The crystal structure Fig 1a hosts triangular lattices of Eu in the ab plane stacking alternatively with Ag double honeycomb lattices decorated by Sb atoms  The Eu subsystem has been reported to order antiferromagnetically below TN1  11 K with successive transition at TN2  72 K  Using single crystals we found that the anomalies in Hall resistivity are associated with the spin-flop like transitions for the magnetic field along the out-of-plane direction suggesting possible topological phase transition of the electronic state induced by the magnetic structural change For understanding the coupling between magnetism and possible topological transport properties it is crucially important to determine the magnetic structures under the magnetic field Previous results We recently performed single crystal neutron diffraction on EuAg4Sb2 at the beamline BT-7 in NCNR The mass of the crystal is 48 mg which was found to be large enough to detect the magnetic Bragg scattering even without using the isotope of Eu We successfully observed satellite peaks around lattice Bragg spots in zero field as shown in Fig 1b-c We observed that the position of the satellite peaks shifted at the magnetic phase transition at TN2 and that the intensity disappeared at around TN1 Fig 1d These behaviors perfectly matched with the magnetic phase diagram determined by the magnetization measurements Fig 1e We also performed the measurement under a magnetic field along the b and c axis For Hb we successfully observed the signature of the metamagnetic transitions by the intensity changedisappearance In contrast we could not observe any satellite peaks around the 300 Bragg peak for the Hc configuration regardless of the application of the magnetic field This is consistent with simulation in which the magnetic Bragg peak intensity is two orders of magnitude weaker than the nuclear diffraction peak It is therefore difficult to monitor the magnetic structural transition under Hc in this configuration Proposed experiment Although the previous experiment revealed the in-plane magnetic modulation in zero field the direct evidence for the spin structure in the M state for Hc Fig 1e is still lacking According to the magnetization measurement the M state should also have the in-plane modulation because no discernible magnetization anomaly has been observed signaling the phase transition from ICM-1 to M phase To confirm this we propose to perform the neutron diffraction study with different crystal orientations at BT-7 As shown in Fig 2a-b the 101 Bragg peak can be set in the scattering plane xy plane in Fig 2b with the rotation of the c axis of the crystal by only nine degrees relative to the z axis As we confirmed that the magnetic satellite peaks are visible around 101 we can monitor the field induced magnetic phase transition without changing the magnetism so much from exact Hc configuration As the first part we will measure the field-dependence of the satellite peaks around 101 at the lowest temperature  5 K and several temperatures below and above the transition temperature at TN1 We will subsequently move to the second part in which we measure the temperature dependence with fixed field to observe the phase transition from the M state to the paramagnetic state We estimate each part takes two days including crystal alignments which must be done accurately for magnetic experiments Note that we found Fig 1a Crystal structure of EuAg4Sb2 b-c Color plot of neutron diffraction intensity around 101 measured in H0L plane at zero field d Temperature dependence of the integrated intensity for the satellite peaks e The H-T phase diagram for Hc determined by the magnetization measurements that the beam flux of PHADES was too weak to do it for our small single crystal In total we request four days of beam time Reference  R Li et al Nat Phys 6 284 2010  S S Stoyko et al J Solid State Chem 192 325 2012  B Gerke et al Solid State Sci 20 65 2013 Fig 2a Schematic scattering plane HKH in the reciprocal space Closed circles are nuclear Bragg spots Red and blue circles are magnetic satellite spots Blue curves are positions for background scattering from polycrystalline aluminum b Relationship between crystal orientation and magnetic field Closed spheres are Eu atoms in a unit cell Laboratory coordination system xyz axes is introduced
