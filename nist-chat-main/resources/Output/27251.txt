Probing the magnetic properties of few layer SrRuO3 in superlattices Xiaofang Zhai1 Jingxian Zhang1 Alexander Grutter2 1Hefei National Lab for Physical Sciences at the Microscale University of Science and Technology of China Hefei Anhui 230026 China 2NIST Center for Neutron Research NIST Gaithersburg MD 20899 We propose to study the two dimensional magnetic property of few layer SrRuO3 in superlattices with nonmagnetic SrTiO3 SrRuO3 is a unique example of 4d based itinerant ferromagnetism FM with a transition temperature Tc of approximately 160K 1 Due to the large crystal field splitting Ru4 in SrRuO3 exhibits a low spin state with four electrons occupying the t2g state t2g4  2 As an extremely poor metal SrRuO3 near a transition between itinerant and localized FM of SrRuO3 allowing the magnetism of SrRuO3 to be readily manipulated using external stimulus such as epitaxial strain layer thickness etc 3-6 Recently few layer or even one monolayer ferromagnetic materials have drawn a great deal of attention due to the realization of two-dimensional magnetism at the monolayer limit SrTiO3 a  3905  is a nonmagnetic insulating substrate with an excellent lattice match to SrRuO3 a  393  so that high quality superlattice structures of SrRuO3 and SrTiO3 can be fabricated In these superlattices the exchange coupling of the ferromagnetic layers through the non-magnetic layers may be tuned through thickness variation while ferromagneticnonmagnetic interactions and interfacial coupling between Ru and Ti magnetic ions may be are expected Here we propose to study ferromagnetism in few-layer and monolayer SrRuO3 in SrRuO3nSrTiO3m superlattices When the number of SrTiO3 unit cells m is increased the planar two dimensional nature of the n unit cells in each SrRuO3 layers is systematically enhanced These superlattices therefore represent an ideal model system through which to study systematic evolution of the magnetism from three dimensional to two dimensional We have performed preliminary studies on SrRuO3nSrTiO3m superlattices grown on 001 SrTiO3 substrates The thickness of the SrRuO3 layer n varies from 1 to 2 while the thickness of the SrTiO3 layer m varies from 1 to 5 Structural characterization using X-ray diffraction reveals good superlattice periodicity In the left panel of Fig 1a and 1b we find that the 22 superlattice is conducting while the 13 superlattice is insulating The SQUID data Fig 1  ab Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for the 13 and 22 superlattices cd The SQUID magnetic characterizations of the 13 and 22 superlattices on the right panel of Fig 1a and 1b shows that both the 13 and 22 superlattices are ferromagnetic although the 13 superlattice is about two orders of magnitude more insulating than the 22 superlattice at the low temperatures These observations reveal a remarkable phase transition in the magnetism and electronic structure between superlattices with one and two monolayers of SrRuO3 In particular the reduction in conductivity demands a fundamentally different mechanism for magnetic exchange mechanism and also suggests that the conductivity is intricately correlated to the magnetic coupling between SrRuO3 layers possibly through spin-polarized electrons leaking into the SrTiO3 Therefore we propose to study the layer resolved magnetism in the few layer SrRuO3nSrTiO3m superlattices using polarized neutron reflectivity PNR in order to fully understand the underlying mechanism at the lowest limit of two dimensional magnetism These measurements will specifically answer the question of whether the observed phase transition is related to the emergence of an induced moment on the SrTiO3 layers through a combination of electron transfer and the magnetic proximity effect Such an induced moment would create a 3-dimensional magnetic superstructure potentially explaining the sharp thickness-dependence We have performed preliminary PNR test of a 13 superlattice and resolved the layer dependent magnetism which have revealed surprising sensitivity to the magnetic depth profile despite the extremely superlattice repeat length Fig 2a shows the fitted reflectivity data of R and R-- measured at 6 K under a large magnetic field of 3 T Fig 2b shows first order Bragg reflection where the spin splitting has been resolved even at a Q-location of 397 nm-1 The spin asymmetry near the critical edge is shown in c and may be readily resolved Modeling reveals that the combination of sign and magnitude of the spin-asymmetry at these two location alone provides a high-degree of Fig 2 PNR and theoretical fit of a SrRuO31SrTiO33 superlattice a near the critical edge and b at the first order Bragg reflection c spin asymmetry near the critical edge showing clear spin-dependent splitting d nuclear and magnetic depth profile used to generate the fits shown sensitivity to the relative distribution of magnetization on the SrRuO3 and SrTiO3 layers so that the FM may be localized to the SrRuO3 layers in the 13 case as shown in Fig 2d Thus the resolution of resolve the layer dependent magnetism in the following samples that we propose to study using PNR is a clearly achievable goal Measurement and Samples We propose to study the following 4 samples using the PNR instrument at the NIST Center for Neutron Research All samples are grown on 001 SrTiO3 1 SrRuO32 SrTiO32SrTiO3 substrate 1010 mm2 2 SrRuO32 SrTiO33SrTiO3 substrate 1010 mm2 3 SrRuO31 SrTiO34SrTiO3 substrate 1010 mm2 4 SrRuO31 SrTiO35SrTiO3 substrate 1010 mm2 All samples will be field-cooled to 6 K in the new 3 T superconducting magnet available at PBR allowing for complete saturation of the SrRuO3 moments All samples have been grown on 1010 mm2 substrates The surface roughness were less than 04 nm Based on the preliminary measurements on the 13 superlattice achieving good counting statistics across the entire desired Q-range will require approximately 2 days of counting time per sample and we consequently request 8 days of beamtime References  G Koster L Klein W Siemons G Rijnders JS Dodge C-B Eom DHA Blank MR Beasley Rev Mod Phys 84 2012 253-298  JB
