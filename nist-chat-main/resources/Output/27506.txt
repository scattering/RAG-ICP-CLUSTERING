Diffraction Study on Nickelate Nd4Ni3O10 and Nd4Ni3O8 Tong Chen  Pengcheng Dai Rice University The discovery of the superconductivity in cuprates has motivated the study of compounds with similar structure aiming to find new superconductors and understand the microscopic origin of the unconventional superconductivity  Although isostructural compounds say Sr2RuO4 and Sr2IrO4 do not exhibit zero-resistivity superconductivity they do provide extra information for people to further understand the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity 2  In general superconductivity in cuprates is believed to arise from spin fluctuations where spin fluctuations play a critical role in mediating the electrons to form Cooper pairs just as phonons being a glue to mediate the electrons in BCS superconductors  Therefore to elucidate the mechanism of the unconventional superconductivity study on the spin fluctuations and magnetic order in the superconductors of similar structures is extremely important  Following the approach to study on isostructural compounds of cuprates theoretical study predicted superconductivity in nickelates The stable nickelates have a formal valence of Ni2 and a electron configuration such as NiO and La2NiO4 while they can also form with Ni3 as LaNiO3  which is proposed to host an artificially layered nickelate heterostructure with a singly occupied band To host electron configuration the unusual valence Ni is required as LaNiO2 from the low-temperature reduction of LaNiO3  In this structure nickel has square two-dimensional NiO2 plane mimicking the configuration of undoped cuprates Subsequently large preferential orbital occupancy near the Fermi level has been observed in the related tri-layer reduced nickelate La4Ni3O8 Ni133   Recently superconductivity is reported in soft-chemistry topotactic reduced NdNiO2 and Nd08Sr02-NiO2 single-crystal thin films  indicating possible series of superconductors based on reduced layered nickelate structure We manage to synthesize poly-crystals of the tri-NiO2-layered compound Nd4Ni3O10 and the related reduced Nd4Ni3O8 For R4Ni3O10 R  La Pr Nd in the family theres no long-range magnetic order but a mysterious metal-to-metal transition around 160 K as well as in Nd4Ni3O8 Therefore it is of great importance to do more detailed diffraction measurements and to study the spin fluctuations in the system which will shed light on the basic mechanism of the superconductivity in the nickelates b a Fig 1  a Schematic of Nd08Sr02NiO3left and Nd08Sr02NiO2right thin films on the substrate b Resistivity as a function of temperature for the reduced NdNiO2 and Nd08Sr02NiO2 We propose to do neutron diffraction to study the metal-to-metal transition around 160 K and the potential magnetic order in the poly-crystalline samples of Nd4Ni3O10 and reduced Nd4Ni3O8 3 grams  3 grams on the high-resolution powder diffractometer BT-1 at NCNR MD We request 2 days on two samples for the proposed measurements Reference  Bednorz J George and K Alex Mller Possible highT c superconductivity in the Ba La Cu O system Zeitschrift fr Physik B Condensed Matter 642 1986 189-193  Maeno Y et al Superconductivity in a layered perovskite without copper Nature 3726506 1994 532  Kim Yeong Kwan et al Observation of a d-wave gap in electron-doped Sr 2 IrO 4 Nature Physics 121 2016 37  Scalapino Douglas J A common thread The pairing interaction for unconventional superconductors Reviews of Modern Physics 844 2012 1383  Dai Pengcheng Antiferromagnetic order and spin dynamics in iron-based superconductors Reviews of Modern Physics 873 2015 855  Chaloupka Ji and Giniyat Khaliullin Orbital order and possible superconductivity in LaNiO 3LaMO 3 superlattices Physical Review Letters 1001 2008 016404  Crespin Michel Pierre Levitz and Lucien Gatineau Reduced forms of LaNiO 3 perovskite Part 1Evidence for new phases La 2 Ni 2 O 5 and LaNiO 2 Journal of the Chemical Society Faraday Transactions 2 Molecular and Chemical Physics 798 1983 1181-1194  Zhang Junjie et al Large orbital polarization in a metallic square-planar nickelate Nature Physics 139 2017 864  Li Danfeng et al Superconductivity in an infinite-layer nickelate Nature 5727771 2019 624-627 Fig 1  a Resistivity as a function of temperature for the homemade Nd4Ni3O10 poly-crystals b Susceptibility as a function of temperature for the sample We can see a clear transition at around 163 K a b
