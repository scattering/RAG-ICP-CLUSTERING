Scientific background Geometrically frustrated magnets with competing nearest-neighbor interactions can possess high degeneracies around the ground state which can lead to exotic phenomena and magnetic states The competing interactions prevents magnetic long-range ordering and disordered states such as spin liquids can be realized While perturbative interactions often lift the degeneracy and induce a variety of ordered states with non-collinear or non-coplanar arrangements of spins Characterizing the novel states with non-trivial static and dynamical correlations is one of the main issues in researches on frustrated systems A magnet comprising tetrahedral clusters consisting of spins is one of the frustrated magnets The tetrahedron naturally possesses an internal degree of freedom and thus non-trivial degeneracy in the ground state Pharmacosiderite PC is an example It crystalizes in a cubic lattice with a  798  Four FeO6 octahedra coupled by edge sharing form a tetramer of Fe3 ions with s  52 The tetramers are located at the corner of the cubic unit cell Fig 1a It is noted that PC does not show any structural transition down to 16 K An upturn in magnetic susceptibility and a peak in heat capacity indicate that antiferromagnetic order occurs at TN  6 K Fig 1b The weak ferromagnetic moment is likely due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya DM interaction A broad peak in susceptibility is well described by a coupled tetramer model with antiferromagnetic J  106 K intra-tetramer and J  29 K inter-tetramer Furthermore the broad peaks are observed in Mssbauer spectrum at 28 K  TN which suggest that Fe spins significantly fluctuate even in the ordered state Fig 1c As described below the unique feature of PC gradually becomes clear geometrical frustration reduces magnetic dimensionality in PC with the 3D cubic structure Previous neutron scattering results and aim of the proposed experiment To investigate magnetic structure of PC powder neutron diffraction measurements were performed on ECHIDNA at ANSTO Figure 2a shows a magnetic diffraction pattern at 16 K Magnetic Bragg peaks appeared at the same Q positions as nuclear peaks indicating a q 0 magnetic order Our Rietveld analysis suggests that the 5 structure is most plausible It should be noted here that the magnitude of refined magnetic moment at 16 K is 21 B a AsO4 FeO6 H2OH3O b c Fig 1 a Crystal structure and Fe sublattice b temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity and c Mssbauer spectra of pharmacosiderite H3OFe4AsO43OH4
