Neutron backscattering spectroscopy on a polymer of intrinsic microporosity for green membrane processes and electronic applications R Zorn P Szymoniak A Schnhals Since the advent of polymers with intrinsic microporosity with the synthesis of PIM-1  see Figure 1a about 15 years ago this new class of polymers initiated a substantial amount of research effort because of its many potential applications Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity PIMs as microporous materials having interconnected pores of characteristic sizes less than 2 nm and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas mostly larger than 700 m2 g-1 PIMs are composed of discrete macromolecular chains with a rigid and contorted backbone leading to inefficient packing in the solid state Their unique structural features and properties make them suitable as materials for devices such as organic light emitting diodes OLEDs and sensors and to produce membranes for gas separations pervaporation and nanofiltration Further applications in water treatment gas storage and electrochemical devices have also been suggested From the above list it can be concluded that PIMs can help to protect our environment and lead to more green applications that can be a great benefit for the society Apart from the possible applications of these innovative polymers they are interesting model systems for fundamental investigations because of their high free volume and stiff chain structure Recently the glass transition which is not detectable by conventional DSC of a series of PIMs was investigated using advanced fast scanning calorimetry  For the majority of applications an understanding of the molecular mobility is required This concerns in particular the fluctuation of the methyl groups because the connection between the pores can be opened or closed by the CH3 groups An interconnected micropore system is essential for instance for nanoseparation processes and electronic application because the conduction mechanism is a microporosity supported charge transport  OOOOCNCN Fig 1a Chemical structure of PIM-1 Fig 1b Chemical structure of PIM-EA-TB and PIM-EA-TBH2 In general less is known about the molecular mobility including vibrations in these complex systems The microporosity of PIMs is due to their rigid ladder-like chain architecture preventing segmental rotations Some dielectric data for PIM-1 have been published recently  For applications a fundamental understanding of the molecular mobility is required This concerns for instance the gas transport properties in green separation membranes where the NNH3CCH3PIM-EA-TBNNHHPIM-EA-TBH2selectivity for the different gases is poorly understood or also for the conductivity for electronic applications In recent neutron time of flight MLZ 13562 and back scattering experiments MLZ 15759 have been carried out to investigate the molecular dynamics of PIM-1 The TOF measurement also included the low frequency vibrations  In the quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments one relaxation process is observed see Fig3 From the q dependence of the detected incoherent elastic structure factor EISF is concluded that this relaxation process corresponds to the methyl group rotation although it is quite different from the CH3 rotation of conventional polymers different temperature range the fraction of mobile CH3 depends on temperature An independent proof of this interpretation does not exist and is required from both the applicational see above as well as the scientific point of view Recently a new type of PIM was synthesized  called PIM-EA-TB TB - Trgers base EA - ethanolenthracene see Fig 1b Compared to PIM-1 PIM-EA-TB has even more advanced properties Also pronounced differences in the microporous structure have been found for both polymers As opposed to PIM-1 during the synthesis of PIM-EA-TB there is a control about the methyl groups So PIM-EA-TB can be synthesized with methyl groups PIM-EA-TB and in an identical form where the CH3 groups are replaced by hydrogens PIM-EA-TBH2 see Fig 2 By quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments on both samples and their detailed comparison a clear-cut decision can be made whether the relaxation process observed for PIM-1 corresponds actually to the methyl group rotation It is known that the replacement of the CH3 groups by H leads to negligible property changes but definitively PIM-EA-TBH2 cannot show any methyl group rotation Moreover till now nothing is known about the molecular mobility of PIM-EA-TB also due to a lack of a noticeable dipole which is another argument to carry out neutron scattering experiments Therefore it is suggested to carry out quasi-elastic neutron scattering on PIM-EA-TB also on a backscattering instrument in the temperature range between 100 K and 400 K at 6 different temperatures This temperature range is deduced from the neutron scattering experiments on PIM-1 The obtained structure factor SqE will be Fourier transformed and divided by the Fourier transformation of the resolution and compared to the data obtained by neutron TOF measurements see proposal 27014 In that way the absolute values of the intermediated time dependent scattering function Sqt are obtained see an example for PIM-1 in Fig 2 The q dependence of the dynamic structure factor Sqt will be analyzed in detail and compared to theoretical models This procedure will allow differentiating between jump-like processes and diffusional motions see an example for PIM-1 in Fig 3 Thereby we can conclude on the molecular mechanism of the process Besides the q-dependence the time or frequency dependence will be considered From that the activation energy of the process will be deduced and discussed All obtained data will be compared to results of PIM-1 In total we will have three samples to investigate the two polymers as well as the empty can Therefore we ask for 3 samples x 6 temperatures x 8 hours  6 days on CHRNS-HFBS including coolingheating time and the 10 K runs which will serve as resolution We want to work at a resolution of ca 1 eV PIM-EA-TB and PIM-EA-TBH2 are obtained via cooperation with N McKeown -101234050607080910EIFSFit functionBST250 KSqtlogt psq147 -1TOF 000408116200204060810black -
