Characterization of a periodic FeSi-film We propose to characterize the reflection behavior of a sample consisting of a periodic stack of layers n50 of 50Ang Fe magnetic and 50Ang Si with polarized neutrons at various external magnetic fields The sample was created by sputtering on a 4 Silicon wafer and should create an intensity peak at q2pid00628 inv Ang see Figure 1 It was subsequently cut currently several pieces about 10mm x 50mm or smaller are available Figure 1 Simulation of the reflection curves from a periodic magnetized FeSi-film The four curves represent the reflectivity for Spin UpDown for 25 and 50 repetitions of the FeSi- films Previous work  indicates that stacks of such films could be used in RF-neutron spin flippers and the characterization in DC-fields can be used to estimate the behavior of the films in magnetic AC-field with frequencies up to several 100kHz In particular the so called MIEZE Neutron Spin Echo setup could be simplified using only two such flippers without the need for further components like polarizer or analyzer Another possible application for such flippers is to examine periodic sample modulations by generating intensity pulses controlling and shifting the phase between these two signals  Beamtime requested Since the region of interest is limited to the low-q region one day of beamtime should allow to determine the polarized reflectivity profiles at 6 different B-field values  KZhernenkov et al AC-polarized neutron reflectometry Application to domain dynamics in thin Fe film Journal of Physics Conference Series 2111012016 2010  M Bleuel Phase Locked Modulated PLM Small Angle Neutron Scattering SANS NIMA A 927 p 184-186 2019
