Synthesis manipulation and characterization of nanomaterial pseudocrystals D ILA and Z Luo Department of Chemistry Physics and Materials Science Fayetteville State University Fayetteville NC 28301 The goal of this research is to better understand the similarities between photon channeling and ion-channeling as proposed by Kukhtaev et al the propagation of photon and ion beams in coherent channeling described by the analogy drawn between the Maxwell equation and the Schrdinger equations and the limitations of such assumption To achieve these goals we have successfully produced regimented structures shown by their Mie absorption spectra and by 3D-microscopy To produce these effects we used Infrasil-301 a highly pure silica as the substrate and implanted ions such as gold and silver at 1450 MeV and 0785 MeV Ag respectfully in order to reach the same depth The implantation was originally conducted at high doses sequentially spot-by-spot using a 2 mm aperture and at 05 mm steps so that a 1 cm2 area was uniformly implanted The total implantation fluences of Au Ag and subsequentlyAu  Ag were varied from 15 x 1016 cm2 to 14 x 1017 cm2 and the implanted area was studied before and after annealing using optical absorption photospectrometry OAP and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry RBS We found that a secondary implantation by Ag ions after Au implantation  nanoparticle formation facilitatee substrate healing upon a secondary annealing step returning the index of refraction to the value near to that of a pristine substrate and the Au nanoparticle absorption to that predicted by the Mie theory Changing the processing order of annealing annealing after both Au and Ag implantations were completed rather than between the Au and Ag implantations eliminated Ag nanocluster formation returned the substrate index of refraction to its pristine value and caused Au nanocluster formation to initiate at lower annealing temperatures We took advantage of the Mie theory and the work by Kreibig U and Vollmer M Optical Properties of Metal Clusters Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidleberg 1995 where regimentation of nanoclusters affects the shape of the OAP spectra as shown in the following figure We successfully reproduced the effects by making ultra-thin layers of such structures as shown in the following two figures As indicated above the increased number of interacting structuresnano-structures the wider the OAP curve becomes To improve the confinement of nano-structures of Au we took advantage of post-implantation annealing and bombardment by MeV Ag followed by annealing This figure is the Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy of Au and Ag-implanted coupons under investigation showing the normalized yield versus channel number The heavier elements near the surface start at higher channel numbers and the shape of each peak corresponds to the distribution of the implanted species and their concentrations The optical image of a similar coupon shows the only Au-implanted area in red only Ag-implanted area in yellow and the overlap is in the center Using 3D microscopy of the same coupon shows in the image on the right the impact of the variable index in the Au  Ag-implanted area which corresponds to the change in the index of refraction of the host due to the existence of nano-clusters of implanted AuAg The next figure shows the 3D optical microscopy of the same region using a polarized filter showing that the MeV Au  Ag-implanted coupon allows polarization in X  Y directions which corresponds to the direction of the implantation steps Meanwhile the spacing between the observed lines corresponds to the 12 x 14 point-by-point implantation steps for this specific coupon At this point we are interested in understanding the change in the index of refraction of the implanted area which includes the surface of the coupon where ions move through and the region where these metallic elements are forming nanoclusters and the crystallinity of these clusters Meanwhile any additional information that will help us to understand the reason behind the polarizability of such compound structures will be useful such as formation of quadrupoles and the constituents of such quadrupoles Each coupon is made up of Infrasil silica originally implanted with Au and Ag at similar depths in order to form quantum dots QD of Ag andor Au Each of the two-ion implantation depths is about 200 to 300 nm where each QD may be between 2 to 20 nm in size covering the volume of a cylinder with diameter between 100 to 500 micrometers For each of these samples we usually have 12 to 14 cylinders with lengths of 50 to 100 nm Obtaining images of these cylinders will be useful but more useful information will be the evidence of 1D 2D or 3D regimentation of QDs even if the data is in k-space I will need help to interpret the data We are interested in characterizing the nature of the ordering 1D 2D 3D among the QDs within each cylinder Imaging would be appropriate for looking at these cylinders which will provide us a big-picture idea of the distribution within the cylinder Simultaneous x-ray imaging on BT2 will be most helpful since Ag and Au exhibit strong x-ray scattering Several techniques such as neutron scattering and x-ray diffraction and the expert scientific opinions at NIST will be extremely valuable for this investigation This research is supported by NSF-PREM and in partnership with the Combat Capabilities Development Command US Army Research Lab at APG MD Useful references Specifically
