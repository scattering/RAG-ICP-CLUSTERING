Magnetic structure estimation of the Shastry Sutherland lattice compound Pr2Pd2Sn Scientific Importance The class of R2T2X intermetallics R  rare earth T  transition metal X  main group have geometrically frustrated R-lattice which forms layers arranged as the Shastry-Sutherland lattice  Yb2Pt2Pb is an interesting member from this class of magnets where the Yb moments are observed to dimerize on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice SSL 2  It has been reported that Yb2Pt2Sn is a metallic SSL close to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point and a heavy fermion Hence this class of magnetic compounds are example systems where the interplay of frustration and quantum criticality can be tested In addition due to the basic triangular motif in the frustrated structure stabilization of different nearest-neighbour J values lead to complex low temperature magnetic structure The R2T2X compounds are derived from the Mo2FeB2-type structure which is a ternary ordered variant of the U3Si2-type space group 127 P4mbm schematic shown in Fig 1  The structure consists of two layers where the first one contains R and T while the second one contains only R and forms the SSL The sites in the two atomic layers nevertheless have the same point symmetry - a fact that has a bearing on the magnetism of these compounds In the SSL the nearest-neighbour exchange interactions J1 favour the formation of dimers while the second-nearest neighbours J2 link the dimers and favour an antiferromagnetically ordered state However indications of complex magnetic structures and development of ferromagnetism have been reported in other 221 class of compounds for example Ce2Pd2Sn In the case of Ce2Pd2xSn1x two transitions at TN  47 K and TC  30 K are observed A modulated character of the intermediate phase with the local moments pointing in the c direction and an incommensurate propagation vector changes its value from 42 K to 28 K where it suddenly becomes ferromagnetic 5 R2T2X compounds have received much attention in the case of R  Ce and also in several U-based compositions  however Pr-based R2T2X are less-investigated In the present proposal we want to use neutron diffraction to study new R2T2X compound Pr2Pd2Sn Preliminary macroscopic characterization data indicates a complex low temperature magnetic structure with field-induced changes Neutron diffraction data will be used to elucidate the microscopic magnetic structure of the Pr moments on the SSL Preliminary Work Polycrystalline samples of Pr2Pd2Sn are prepared by arc-melting method The as-melt samples are annealed for homogenization and powder X-ray diffraction patterns are recorded to check the phase formation and purity Figure 2 a Rietveld refined X-ray diffraction pattern of Pr2Pd2Sn in Mo2FeB2-type structure P4mbm space group b Shows the specific heat at different applied magnetic fields indicating a gradual suppression of the peak at TN  25 K with increasing value of magnetic fields up to 5 T inset c The magnetic susceptibility confirms the phase transition at 25 K and is suppressed by external magnetic fields Through the Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction data we confirm that Pr2Pd2Sn adopts the Mo2FeB2-type crystal structure with the space group P4mbm where the rare earth atom form the SSL as depicted in Figure 1 The results of the Rietveld analysis are presented in Figure 2 a where agreement between the data and fit appears good No additional Figure 1 A schematic of the Shastry Sutherland lattice formed by Pr atoms in Pr2Pd2Sn is indicated by the green spheres peaks are found in the X ray diffraction pattern confirming the purity of the synthesized sample to within the resolution of laboratory X rays The refined lattice parameters are a  b  7728  and c  3873  and are comparable to the values reported in some of the other R2T2X compounds  Clear indication of a phase transition in the form of a peak is found at TN  25 K in the specific heat curve of Pr2Pd2Sn This is presented in Figure 2 b The inset of the figure shows the variation of the low temperature specific heat under the application of external magnetic fields up to 5 T It can be seen that the peak at 25 K is broadened by the application of 2 T but again assumes a peak when the magnetic field is increased to 3 T or 5 T The peak also shifts to low temperaturtes This preliminary result indicates a field-induced change in the magnetic phase transition at 25 K Our recent neutron scattering experiments and specific heat study on Er2Pd2Sn showed signatures of modulated magnetic structures at low temperatures unpublished A complete magnetic characterization of the samples is achieved through magnetometry The -1T of Pr2Pd2Sn follows a linear temperature dependence for T  50 K obeying Curie-Weiss CW law Based on the CW fit values of eff for Pr2Pd2Sn is 37 BPr3 and the corresponding p is 139 K The negative p value reveals the antiferromagnetic AFM interaction dominant in the compound Limited research on Pr2Pd2Sn exists in the literature which makes it a strong case to be probed further using neutrons to determine the magnetic structure to allow a comparison with the other members of the R2T2X class of Shastry-Sutherland lattice compounds Experiment BT1 is our chosen instrument and offers the required resolution and sample environment to achieve our goals of determining the magnetic structures For the proposed diffraction experiment we intend to use powder sample of Pr2Pd2Sn We have 36 grams of powder characterized by x-rays magnetic and thermodynamic measurements available We will use a small diameter sample can to reduce the moderate neutron absorption of the materials We are interested in collecting data at 200 K 50 K and subsequently with the main focus in the region 10 - 18 K at every 2 K to follow the onset of magnetic order at 25 K and to map a 2-step magnetic structure change across the transition if present Considering 6-8 h for each measurement and 2-3 h for cooling down we request 2 days of measurement time for this experiment We note this measurement will require a He4 cryostat to reach base temperature of 18 K The powder diffraction data will be analyzed using Rietveld method and the magnetic structures will be treated using representation analysis coded in SARAh The present set of experiments use standard experimental set-ups available at BT1 The samples are stable at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure and do not demand special care or treatment before or during the experiments Conclusions In conclusion neutron powder diffraction on Pr2Pd2Sn will resolve the magnetic structure of this less-investigated Shastry Sutherland lattice intermetallic which has an interesting evolution of phase transition under applied magnetic field The estimation of magnetic structure using the data from the present experiment might motivate future magnetic field-dependent studies using neutrons It would also support our proposal to National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for high field magnetization measurements References  Shastry B S and Sutherland B Physica B 108B 1069 1981  Kim M S Aronson M C Phys Rev Lett 110 017201 2013  Kim M S Aronson M C J Phys Condens Matter 23 164204 2011  Havela L et al Chem Met Alloys 6 170 2013  Sereni J G et al Phys Rev B 80 024428 2009  Laffargue D et al Solid State Commun 100 575 1996
