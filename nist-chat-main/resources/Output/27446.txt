 Page 1 of 3 Statement of Research Scientific Importance Low-dimensional quantum magnets are the materials in which the magnetic spin-spin interactions are restricted to less than three dimensions This dimensionality plays an important role in determining its magnetic ground state and excitations Along with the low-dimensionality the presence of geometrical frustration in the triangular-lattice magnets TLMs with AFs provides an exotic quantum spin states like quantum spin liquid QSL which are the contemporary interest in the condensed matter physics Among the variety of spin liquid materials the most promising candidates are recognized as the triangular and the honeycomb planar magnets with spin-orbit couplings Down to very low temperature the absence of any magnetic ordering and persisting of magnetic fluctuation are the key features of the QSL materials The recent discovery of the triangular lattice magnet YbMgGaO4 YMGO which has been proposed as the first QSL candidate having the strong spin-orbit coupling invoked further resurgence in searching the new QSL materials However due to presence of GaMg disorders some experiments and theoretical calculations raised the issue of having disordered spin state andor QSL stability 1 The recent theoretical study on NaYbO2 and NaYbS2 systems further added more importance of layered triangular-lattice materials suggested to host the spin-liquid ground states  Figure 1 The crystal structure of AYbSe2 Na K and the pictures of obtained from the X-ray difrraction Here we focused on AYbSe2 A  Li Na K and Rb having similar R-3m space group as YMGO The Yb3 ions exhibit a flat and perfect triangular lattice and the center of the YbSe6 octahedra as shown in figure 1 and recently identified as TLM and putative QSL candidate on NaYbSe2  In contrary to the YMGO this dilafossites structure AYbSe2 has single Yb3 site with ABAB stacking of the triangular layers along the crystallographic c-axis Although there are many studies done on the delafossites ABX2  A- nonmagnetic monovalent metal ion B -Yb Ce or rare-earth ion and X - O S or Se structure but the studies on AYbSe2 A  Na and K are rather scarce 3- Very recently the low temperature magnetic and heat capacity studies on NaYbSe2 reveal the absence of any long-range ordering down to 50 mK temperature  Interestingly it has been found that although the distance between nearest neighbor Yb3 in NaYbSe2 is larger but the Curie-Weiss temperature and the moment are comparable with the NaYbO2 and NaYbS2 samples In fact the low temperature magnetic susceptibility of NaYbSe2 is found higher in magnitude than the other two samples O and S  Keeping in mind the similar structure AYbSe2 A  Li Na K and Rb is a good candidate of triangular-lattice magnets behaving as two-dimensional layer magnets Lattice constants and nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor out of plane distances are tabulated in Table 1 Nearest neighbor distance in-plane increase with Li to Rb And more significantly we expect the out of plane coupling is suppressed from Li to Rb due to more spacing between the triangular planes So far to the best of our knowledge there is no previous report on neutron scattering results on these materials Page 2 of 3 a  b  c  Nearest neighbor distance  Next nearest neighbor distance -

50 K The large negative value indicates the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions AFs between Yb3 ions The isothermal magnetization up to 7 T of magnetic field at different temperatures from 03 K to 16 K are shown in Figure 3b For the higher temperatures the magnetization increases linearly with applied field whereas the low temperature magnetization data does not show linear behavior RbYbSe2 shows larger saturated moment than KYbSe2 Figure 2 a The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility  of KYbSe2 and RbYbSe2 sample with Curie-Weiss fit red line are shown Inset shows the inverse of magnetic susceptibility 1  b Isothermal magnetization data are shown at different temperatures for of KYbSe2 and RbYbSe2 Page 3 of 3 Choice of Instrument We need an instrument with sufficient resolution with an incident neutron energy of about 10 meV to study the magnetic excitations at low temperatures Considering the excitation spectrum reported on NaYbO2 DCS spectrometer will be ideal for our study We will also study the crystal electric field excitations of this new system KYbSe2 and RbYbSe2 We will need to measure at low temperatures below 300 mK Therefore will require He-3 system or a dilution fridge Experiment Plan In order to help understand this new rare-earth based triangular lattice antiferromagnet and study the exotic physical phenomena in these systems we propose to perform inelastic neutron scattering study on KYbSe2 and RbYbSe2 systems using a powder samples We will investigate the effect of replacing larger atom Rb with K effectively increasing the spacing between the triangular layers by measuring both systems High quality powder samples of KYbSe2 and RbYbSe2 are available We will use incident energy of about 327 meV in the low resolution mode at DCS for low energy measurements We will also use Ei  25 meV to study the crystal electric field levels of this system We will spend most of the experiment time at base temperature and will need dilution refrigerator or He-3 system to study the system at low temperatures We will also measure at one high temperature as the background In order to carry out this experiment with sufficient statistics and time for background measurement and sample change we estimate we will need 7 days of beam time Safety Considerations Samples are non-toxic non-corrosive and non-radioactive Gloves should be worn as a precaution References  Nature Physics volume13 pages117-122 2017  Scientific Reports 5 16419 2015  arXiv190901224 2019  Chin Phys Lett Vol 35 No 11 117501 2018  Physical Review B 98 220409R 2018  J Phys Condens Matter 31 205601 2019
