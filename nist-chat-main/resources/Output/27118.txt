Dynamics of Water in Confined Aqueous Salt Solutions Scientific Importance Abundancy of water in the Earth is such that it is present everywhere either in the form of bulk confined in various media or in its solution form Physical properties of water are dramatically different on those states and becomes very important in determining the fundamental processes associated with it such as energy storage in electrical double layer capacitors as well as in transporting ions in biological membranes Transport of ions and electrochemical activity in energy storage devices are closely related with the nature of the confined hydrated ions1 It is important to explore the structure and dynamics of water associated with ions in bulk and in confinement in molecular level in order to understand the fundamentals of not only the ion transport and energy storage mechanism of electrical double layer capacitors but advancing the knowledge of bio-geo processes2 Therefore the study of structure and dynamics of water always remains as one of the interesting topics in multiple research areas Even though the dynamics of water in bulk and in various confinements have been studied since long using experimental theoretical and simulations approaches34 there is still a lot of interests on looking at dynamics of water at different experimental conditions because of its unique behaviors that are not transferable from one conditions to another Here we are aiming to explore the dynamics of water in confined aqueous salt solutions NaCl and KCl using quasielastic neutron scattering QENS Since the presence of ion is expected to disturb the hydrogen bonding network of bulk water impacting its structure and dynamics significantly confining the salts solution in nanoporous materials further perturb the water molecules impacting its physical properties Preliminary Work Despite having same number of valance electrons alkali metals in aqueous solutions behaves differently For example sodium forms a tight hydration shell around it compared to potassium which promotes to break the hydrogen bond network of water5 These differences are attributed to the different surface charge densities and relative sizes of those ions QENS has been employed to investigate the dynamics of water at various salt concentrations6 It is found that the average translational mobility of water is significantly slowed down by structure making Kosmotrope Na  ion compared to the structure breaking chaotrope K ion as presented in figure 1 Furthermore vibration dynamics of water confined in 2D material under the presences of those ions Na and K have shown totally opposite trend of ordering of the water molecules compared to bulk aqueous solution7 This observation was further conformed from the radial distribution function calculated from simulation which is shown in figure 2 This opposite trend of ordering of the water molecules has been attributed to the morphology and the surface chemistry of the confining matrix Even though QENS study of other salts solutions such as LiCl and CaCl2 confined in nanoporous silica has shown further slowing down of the water dynamics due to the confinement effect8 dynamics study of water in aqueous solution of NaCl and KCl in confinement has never been attempted Here we purpose to study the dynamic of water in aqueous solutions of NaCl and KCl confined in nanoporous carbon MCM-41 of 2 nm diameter We expect to have the water molecules having the same ordering as observed in confined 2D layer materials Choice of Instrument This proposal aims at understanding the fundamentals of the water dynamics in aqueous solution of Na and K ions confined in porous material using QENS QENS has successfully been employed to study the dynamics of water in bulk and confined aqueous solution using backscattering spectrometer67 Furthermore we have successfully employed HFBS in past to reveal water dynamics in confinement in presences of metal ions9 We expect different behaviors of Na and K ions compared to Li and Ca ions as observed in ref 8 with water in confinement The dynamics will be within the accessible energy window of the HFBS spectrometer The finding of this research will enable us to further enhance our current understanding of confinement effect on the dynamics of water in different systems Experiment Plan We would like to perform QENS experiments on the High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer HFBS to study the dynamics of water in confined aqueous salt solution Since water is rich in hydrogen therefore QENS spectra are dominated by scattering from water We plan to study the dynamics of water in bulk salt solutions NaCl and KCl solutions for comparison and aqueous salt solutions NaCl and KCL confined in porous carbon Elastic intensity scan from both bulk and confined salt solutions will be performed to illustrate the aqueous salt solution confinement QENS spectra will be collected at 300 K only from the confined aqueous salt solutions Dynamic range of HFBS will not be enough for bulk aqueous salt solutions which will be measure at BASIS separately Furthermore other temperature of interest will be chosen based on the elastic intensity scan The resolution function 20K from each sample along with vanadium standard for data normalization will also be measured We will have 4 solutions bulk and confined To run them both in bulk elastic scan only and confinement both elastic scan and dynamic measurements we request 5 days of beam time to complete this set of experiment at HFBS spectrometer Safety Considerations Samples will be loaded into flat aluminum cans In wire will be used to seal the cans Can filling will be done prior to beam time therefore does not need any additional safety precautions during the experiment References 1 Kalluri RK Biener MM Suss ME Merrill MD Stadermann M Santiago JG Baumann TF Biener J Striolo A Phys Chem Chem Phys 2013 5 2309-2320 2 Qiang Li Jie Song Flemming Besenbacher and
