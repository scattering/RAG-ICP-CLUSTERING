Effect of calcium on bilayer compressibility David P Hoogerheide Elizabeth G Kelley Sergey Bezrukov The mechanical properties of biological membranes influence processes ranging from protein binding and insertion to transport vesicle formation The lipid bilayers that form the underlying matrix of these membranes behave as thin elastic sheets described by a compressibility and bending modulus While the biophysics community has well-established methods to measure the structure with sub-nm resolution measuring these moduli of lipid bilayers presents additional challenges The value of the bending modulus depends on the measurement method Nagle Jablin et al 2015 and several of these methods rely on adding solvents sugars or salts to osmotically stress the membranes Dimova 2014 Having complementary measurements on well-characterized model systems is highly desirable As such the aim of this proposal is to establish the complementarity of bench-top bilayer overtone analysis BOA and neutron spin echo NSE spectroscopy As a first step we will use these techniques to investigate the effects of calcium on model phospholipid bilayers a topic of both fundamental interest and highly relevant for the development of molecular dynamic force fields In a collaboration between the NIST Center for Neutron Research and the Section on Molecular Transport at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development we are developing an electrical probe of the compressibility of a freestanding lipid membrane The technique which we call bilayer overtone analysis BOA involves an ac electrical excitation across the lipid membrane and phase-sensitive detection of the second and third harmonics of the resulting ac current both of which are proportional to the membrane compressibility A schematic of the measurement is shown in Figure 1 The second harmonic amplitude of the ac current is also proportional to the trans-membrane potential and vanishes if the electric potential across the bilayer is symmetric ie the transmembrane potential is zero Thus measurement of the second and third harmonic amplitudes of the ac current allows real-time tracking of the membrane compressibility and transmembrane potential over the course of an experiment where the membrane is subject to varying conditions such as protein binding or buffer exchange Hoogerheide Noskov et al 2017 BOA is not a new technique it has been described experimentally and theoretically in the literature for some decades Sokolov and Kuzmin 1980 particularly as a method for tracking the transmembrane potential with time However it has not attained widespread use because the conventional method of forming bilayers was a painting technique in which the lipid was dissolved in an organic oil and brushed over an orifice This procedure introduces large amounts of oil into the membrane creating 5V2  655S0 55605  5I5Q5P5I5N5P2 sin455S0 5a Figure 1 Schematic of bilayer overtone analysis A freestanding lipid bilayer electrically isolates reservoirs that are coupled to external electronic excitation and detection circuits using AgAgCl electrodes The expression for the second harmonic current 5V2 is given for ac excitation frequency 5S0 dc voltage offset 5I5Q5P and ac excitation amplitude 5I5N5P where the bilayer capacitance depends on voltage via the expression 565I  5601  55I2 The parameter 5 is proportional to the bilayer compressibility lens-shaped structures that increase the compressibility of the bilayer 2 orders of magnitude or more over the value expected for dry ie oil-free bilayers Alvarez and Latorre 1978 By contrast the bilayers we form for BOA measurements are nearly dry As a result the measured volume compressibility  3  108 Pa1 is comparable to the canonical value estimated from the measured area compressibility KA and the bilayer thickness  2  108 Pa1 These small values of the compressibility require phase-sensitive measurement of the second harmonic of the ac current at the pA level requiring state of the art lock-in current amplifier technology Leveraging these improvements to the sample preparation and instrumentation we have recently performed BOA measurements exploring the effect of calcium on the properties of anionic bilayers This is a problem of significant contemporary interest particularly because the molecular dynamics force fields for divalent ions require additional refinement Pan Cheng et al 2014 Melcrov Pokorna et al 2016 As shown in Figure 2 the bilayer compressibility decreases by about 25 when the calcium concentration on one side of a DOPS bilayer is increased to 500 mM This effect is not seen for DOPC bilayers which bind calcium ions more weakly We propose exploring the synergy between the benchtop BOA measurements of membrane compressibility and neutron spin echo NSE measurements of bilayer bending fluctuations using the NCNR CHRNS NSE instrument NSE measurements will provide a measure of the effective bending modulus eff Nagao Kelley et al 2017 The bilayer compressibility and bending rigidity are directly related through the well-established relationship effKA  h2 where h is the bilayer thickness and  is a constant Assuming the addition of calcium does not change the coupling between bilayer leaflets or the dissipation within the bilayer then the 25 decrease in compressibility ie increase in KA measured with BOA should correspond to a 25 increase in the bending modulus eff Any differences between the scaling of KA and eff with calcium concentration will highlight other contributions to the membrane mechanical properties and provide additional insights into the membrane dynamics on the nanoscale The proposed experiments will combine our expertise in BOA and measuring bilayer fluctuations with the NCNR CHRNS NSE to develop new analysis methods while also addressing a fundamentally interesting question in membrane biophysics Figure 2 Bilayer overtone analysis measurements of the effect of calcium on bilayer compressibility Top The second harmonic current depends linearly on dc voltage The slope is proportional to the membrane compressibility while the dc offset is equal to the transmembrane potential Bottom The slope as a fraction of its value without calcium iethe fractional compressibility as a function of calcium concentration for zwitterionic DOPC bilayers and anionic DOPS bilayers Proposed experiments We plan to measure vesicles composed of pure DOPS as well as pure DOPC with increasing calcium concentration As shown in Figure 2 BOA analysis shows a 25 decrease in compressibility for pure DOPS and no significant change in the pure DOPC Lipid vesicles will be prepared in 1 M KCl buffered with 5 mM tris at pH 70 containing 3 different concentrations of CaCl2 including 0 mM 50 mM and 500 mM to match the BOA experiments For the experiments containing calcium a complementary set of measurements in which two equivalents of KCl are added to control for the effect of chlorine ions for a total of 5 conditions for each lipid species Lipid solutions will be prepared at a concentration of 5 mgmL lipid in D2O buffer to minimize the electrostatic interactions between vesicles Samples will be loaded in 4 mm cells to compensate for the low sample concentration NSE experiments will be performed using 11  and 8  neutrons to access a q-range of 003 -1  q 01 -1 and Fourier times up to 100 ns All measurements will be performed at room temperature Based on previous measurements we estimate each sample will take  20 h Therefore we are requesting 12 days of beamtime on the NGA-NSE spectrometer to measure 10 samples solvent background and instrument resolution References Alvarez O and R Latorre 1978 Voltage-dependent capacitance in
