topological quantum materials Haldane materials with topologically-protected quantum states discovered by 2016 Physics Nobel Laureate F D Haldane2-3 have been front-runners in the field of topological qubits due to their ability to resist changes4-6 The stability of Haldane materials comes from the Haldane energy gap2-7 which exists between the ground and excited state of the metal atom The energy gap is what leads to the ability to resist changes from external perturbations that can dephase electron spin from its superposition Haldane stated in the Haldane conjecture that an antiferromagnetic chain of eg an integer-spin NiII compound would have a gap in the energy between the ground state and the excited state2-7 The chain needs to exhibit an antiferromagnetic property in order to have the Haldane energy gap Through the AKLT Affleck Kennedy Lieb Tasaki model the spin  electrons in each NiII ion can become entangled through the chain and creates an edge state of unentangled spin  electrons at both end of the finite chain7 These unentangled electrons at both ends of the chain can be used to store information for quantum computation The edge state is doubly degenerate so its property is protected by time-reversal symmetry and other symmetries such as spin-reversal symmetry8 Several chemical systems exhibiting Haldane properties such as NiC2H8N22NO2ClO4 NENP39-10 have been studied extensively High-field electron paramagnetic resonance HF-EPR11 and far-IR12 spectroscopies have been used directly measure the Haldane energy gaps Inelastic neutron scattering INS is a unique technique to directly measure the energy gaps as well as to confirm the magnetic nature of the transitions4713 which decrease intensity with increasing Q Q  vector of momentum transfer during the INS process14 The Haldane gap of MOF 1 is believed to be 115 cm-1 based on susceptibility measurements1 MOF 1 if confirmed by the proposed INS studies to be a Haldane material is particularly attractive as its structure Fig 1 is different from those of other reported Haldane materials such as NENP10 or CsNiCl38 which are essentially 3D Fig 1 Left Structure of NiII MOF Ni-ox-enn 11 Right The Nienox 2-D net in 1 viewed almost along the b-axis 2 materials containing the 1D Haldane chains MOF 1 is however a layered 2D material containing the 1D supposedly Haldane chains inside each plane MOF 11 could potentially be exfoliated into nanosheets as having been done for other layered 2D MOFs15 If successful such 2D layers would allow detailed probing of each 1D Haldane chain which to our knowledge has not been reported We propose to use DCS to probe deuterated Ni-ox-en-d8n 1-d8 or Ni-ox-en-d4n 1-d4 The N atoms in -en-d4 are deuterated by INS confirming that it is indeed a Haldane material Deuterated ethylenediamine-d8 is prepared by the method in Ref 16 or obtained commercially17 Ethylenediamine-d4 is also synthesized by a procedure in Ref 16 through changing the H atoms in H-N bonds of ethylenediamine with D2O 2 Preliminary Reported Work Magnetic susceptibility measurements have been reported for NiII MOF 11 Fig 2 shows a broad maximum at 50 K with magnetic susceptibility max  991 x 10-3 cm3 mol-1 before decreasing1 The inverse susceptibility plot reveals linear behavior above 170 K and modeling data with the Curie-Weiss equation gives C  13082 cm3 mol-1 K and   -8395 K Using an equation which accounts for the presence of the Haldane energy gap to fit the data the authors obtained g  21942 and J  2731 cm-1 The value of the Haldane gap was calculated to be Eg  115 cm-11 Our group has successfully prepared MOF 1 to study whether it is a Haldane material We have studied recently magnetic properties of several metal compounds including single-molecule magnets SMMs by INS at DCS and CNCS and VISION at Spallation Neutron Source ORNL18-21 We have also probed the effect of magnetic field on methyl rotation in an SMM by QENS at BASIS22 A review on neutron instruments for coordination chemistry research led by Dr Xue was recently published14 3 Choice of Instrument We plan to use DCS and a 10 T magnet to perform this experiment DCS is the proper choice of the INS instrument due to the following 1 Suitable energy range of the excitation 5 meV 40 cm-1 2 High neutron flux and a large detector 3 10 T magnet in the sample environment 4 Experiment Plan The measurements will be performed with an incident energy Ei  5 meV at 17 K with applied fields of 0 3 6 and 10 T Two grams of polycrystalline sample of 1-d8 or 1-d4 will be rolled in an aluminum foil cigar before being packed in an Al sample can and sealed under helium as an exchange gas The measurement time is about 10 hours per field Altogether we kindly ask for 3 days of beam time at DCS to gather sufficient statistics The INS data collected at 0 T and inside magnetic fields will allow us to monitor the field and Q dependence of peaks Fig 2 Thermal dependence of M red and the MT blue products for 11 with best-fit lines from the Haldane gap equation 3 5 Data Analysis and Scientific Outcomes Data from CNCS will be used to confirm the Haldane property in 1 so to advance the research into probing the 2D nanosheets of the exfoliated NiII MOF and their potential uses as topological qubits 6 Safety Considerations The compounds are not listed in the MSDS Material Safety
