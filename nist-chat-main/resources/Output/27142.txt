Dynamics of Ionic Liquids Confined in Porous Carbon Fibers Scientific Importance Carbon fibers are superior materials for flexible and wearable electronics12 as well as for aerospace applications3 because of their mechanical strength flexibility low density electrical conductivity chemical stability high temperature tolerance and small thermal expansion coefficient3-5 Carbon fibers mostly have been adopted as electrically conductive supports for high-capacitance pseudocapacitive materials in supercapacitors6-9 In the last decade carbon fibers have been the focal point of growing efforts to turn them into active components instead of just supports11011 The direct use of carbon fibers as self-supporting electrodes removes the need for time-consuming processes to load other materials such as pseudocapacitive materials conductive additives and binders1213 that introduce additional interfacial resistance and are detrimental to ultrafast chargedischarge However there are problems Most carbon fibers are solid carbon filaments produced pyrolytically from pitch14 polyacrylonitrile PAN15 Figs 1A D and E and biorenewable polymers eg cellulose16 lignin17 and others181 Their poor surface areas 10 m2 g1 render them incapable of storing a large amount of electrochemical energy2021A variety of porous carbon fibers PCFs have been prepared by electrospinning PAN blended with sacrificial homopolymers2223 SiO2 nanoparticles2425 and additives11 Although these methods produce PCFs their control over the pore size and uniformity is unsatisfactory because of the macrophase separation of the polymer blends Fig 1 B F and G and the difficulty in distributing the additives uniformly in the PAN matrix Furthermore the removal of inorganic particles involves the use of highly toxic and corrosive chemicals and often it is challenging to fully remove them2425 Alternatively the use of PAN-containing block copolymers as precursors is a promising way to create hierarchical porous structures in carbon fibers26-29 In contrast to polymer blends block copolymers microphase-separate to form highly uniform mesoporous structures29 with pore sizes in the range of 2 to 50 nm34 Furthermore block copolymers can create interconnected meso- and micropores Mesopores serve as ion-buffering reservoirs and ion-transport pathways that reduce the ion diffusion distances from the bulk electrolyte to the micropores resulting in an enhanced rate capability621 Our lab has developed a method for synthesizing hierarchical PCFs with highly controlled structures using block copolymer self-assembly Fig 1 C H and I Our method adopts a metal-free reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer RAFT polymerization of polyacrylonitrile-block-methyl methacrylate PAN-b-PMMA followed by electrospinning oxidation and pyrolysis The as-prepared PCFs have hierarchically interconnected meso- and micropores with a high surface area of 503 m2 g1 and a rich nitrogen content of 128 The PCFs achieve a high surface areanormalized capacitance of 66 F cm2 substantially higher Fig 1 Fabrication of carbon fibers Conventional A B and new C methods for synthesizing carbon fibers from various

and analyze the ion diffusion especially of ionic liquids through these porous carbon fibers Preliminary Work Fast and effective ion transport is crucial for electrochemical processes and reactions We want to ask the following main scientific question How fast can the ions diffuse or transport inside the block copolymer-based porous carbon fibers In our preliminary electrochemical tests data not shown using aqueous KOH electrolyte PCFs exhibited ultra-fast ion diffusion kinetics evident by their ultra-small diffusion resistances  The  values of our PCF-based electrodes were smaller than other MnO2-based materials We have ongoing electrochemical work on organic ionic liquids including BMIBF4 which will be compared with QENS studies Recently we managed to collect elastic scan Figure 2 data from one set of carbon fiber loaded with BMIBF4 using high flux backscattering spectrometer HFBS The data suggest that the ionic liquid is totally confined an absence of sharp intensity drop inside the porous carbon fiber and has detectable dynamics at room temperature This measurement not only justifies the feasibility of the experiment but also warrants more beamtime on HFBS to complete a set of measurements for a publication Choice of Instrument Dynamics of electrolyte molecules in the porous carbon fibers in charged and discharged states will be studied using Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering QENS Recent study30 Fig 2 used QENS to resolve the mobility of solvent molecules in neutral untreated charged and discharged states in confinement Furthermore QENS has successfully been used to study the mobility of water31 and ionic liquids32 in confinement Since QENS relies on the high incoherent neutron scattering cross-section of hydrogen and the to-be investigated ionic liquid molecules contain hydrogen we propose to investigate the microscopic dynamics of ionic liquids confined in the porous carbon fibers The mobility of those organic molecules will be within the dynamical range covered by HFBS spectrometer Experiment Plan and Data Analysis Synthesis and characterization using SEMTEM Physisorption XPS XRD EIS and Raman of the PCFs formed from block copolymers namely polymethyl methacrylate-block-polyacrylonitrile will be carried out by the users at their home institution PCFs will be synthesized at three very high temperatures 800 oC 1000 oC 1200 oC to remove all hydrogen Ionic liquid BMIBF4 will be loaded into PCFs at home institution Charging and discharging of the ionic liquids loaded PCFs in a glovebox will be carried out on site just before the experiment Charged sample will be loaded into Teflon coated annual can Spectra from pure ionic liquids and ionic liquids confined in PCFs pristine charged and discharged will be collected at 300 K A sample specific resolution at 10 K will also be measured Elastic scan of each sample on heating at 2 Kmin will be carried out to demonstrate evidence of confinement We will have 7 samples pristine ionic liquid and pristineloaded PCFs for each temperature in total Therefore we request 5 days of beamtime in HFBS spectrometer Data will be analyzed in collaboration with the instrument team Safety
