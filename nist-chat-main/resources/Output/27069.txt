1 Dynamics of Structure Building under Electric Fields in Colloidal Complex Fluids studied by Phase-locked Modulated SANS Background The dynamics within concentrated colloidal dispersions are intimately linked to the structure This has been recognised in a number of practical applications where for example electric fields are used to change rheological response Electrorheology although known and studied in some detail for a long time  has become an important specialist field of study For example shear thickening behaviour can be modified using alternating electric fields  The present proposal is to take forward an understanding of how variable electric fields alter the structure in simple model dispersions and to determine the dynamic response of the colloidal structure This study will exploit instrumental technique developments that extend the TISANE method using phase locked modulated small-angle neutron scattering PLM-SANS  with an applied electric field An old study showed that sterically stabilized polymethylmethacrylate particles in organic solvents such as alkanes  could be slightly charged when appropriate metal alkanoates were added and would align in an alternating electric field forming strings Example data is shown in Figure 1 Similar results of electrophoretic mobility were observed for silica dispersions in oils The present proposal is to make a study of the dynamic response of the structure within a model dispersion rather than simply the time-averaged organization as observed in the early work 2 Figure 1 Contour plots of equilibrium average scattered intensity for a 10 dispersion of PMMA particles in dodecane containing 0025 wt calcium octanoate at various applied field strengths 50 Hz  The nearest neighbor peak shows at momentum transfer just below 0003 -1 Samples and experimental set-up The sample will consist of PMMA latex prepared with a grafted layer of poly 12-hydroxystearic acid grafted to the surface with a glycidyl linker as described in previous studies These have been kindly provided by A B Schofield of the University of Edinburgh UK The particles are about 200 nm diameter and the electrophoretic mobility with the added calcium octanoate is 110-9 m2 V-1 s-1 So that the dispersion medium is fluid at room temperature but not too volatile the experiments will be made with particles dispersed in n-decane which is available as a deuterated material and so maximises contrast Figure 2 Schematic diagram of experimental arrangement with electrodes connected to external power supply The experimental geometry is shown schematically in figure 2 and we will use a 1 mm neutron path length cuvette with an electric field transverse across the beam Approximate calculations show that depending on hydrodynamic effects motion would be observed in the kHz regime with applied fields of order 1 to 2 kV cm-1 The sample will be prepared by centrifugation and redispersion in the required volume of dispersion medium at a particle volume fraction of about 02 20 This has previously shown large orientation effects and the structure with no applied field is expected to resemble that of a hard-sphere liquid with a strong correlation peak in the average structure factor that would distort first into an elliptical rather than circular pattern and eventually form discrete peaks as the field strength increases The intention is to follow changes at several points in the phase cycle so as to determine the dynamics of the expected string formation and disruption Observation of a wider momentum transfer range simultaneously should allow role of interactions that do not just relate to first neighbors to be investigated For this reason we request VSANS although some useful measurements could also be started with a 30-m SANS instrument Measuring time Neutron beam Electrodes through stoppers Sample in fused quartz cell E 3 Initial measurements will record the two-dimensional scattering pattern around the particle correlation peak without time resolution at 15 combinations of frequency and field strength With set-up time this will take 1 day These will allow optimized choice of conditions for measurements with phase modulation at 5 frequencies and 4 different phase settings with pulses in the range 10 to 1250 Hz These will need about two hours for each acquisition and so require 2 days We therefore request a total of 3 days on the VSANS instrument Data analysis Data analysis will be made using the standard models for interacting spherical particles that are available in the SASview software package after reduction using the regular NCNR software  References  A PGast C FZukoski Electrorheological fluids as colloidal suspensions Adv Colloid Interf Sci 30 1989
