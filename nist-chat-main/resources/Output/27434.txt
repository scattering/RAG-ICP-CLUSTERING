 Page 1 of 2 Investigate the magnetic chirality of a new chiral magnet Co13TaS2 Scientific Importance The chiral magnets that allow the asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya D-M interactions have become a subject of active experimental and theoretical investigations in recent years because of their unusual magnetic behavior1- For example a topological ground state called the magnetic soliton lattice has been observed in a chiral magnet Cr13NbS2 Cr13NbS2 crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric hexagonal space group P6322 with Cr atoms intercalated between 2H-stacked NbS2 layers Most recently we successfully synthesized high quality single crystals of Co13TaS2 which could be a new candidate for chiral magnets Similar to Cr13NbS2 magnetic Co atoms in Co13TaS2 are intercalated in the van der Waals gap between the 2H-stacked TaS2 layers forming a chiral space group of P6322 as shown in Fig 1a Bulk single crystal Co13TaS2 has been little studied The only previous report is in the 1980s and it is reported to have collinear antiferromagnetic ordering below TN  35K But our Co13TaS2 single crystal shows more complicated magnetic properties As shown in Fig 1b our single crystal exhibits two magnetic transitions near 35 K and 15 K with magnetic field applied along c-axis respectively Below 15 K a splitting is observed in the Zero field cooledfield cooled ZFCFC magnetic susceptibility with magnetic field applied along c-axis However the magnetic susceptibility measured in magnetic field along ab-plane only exhibits one transition near 15 K without the splitting between ZFC and FC as shown in Fig 1c Furthermore an anomalous Hall effect is observed below 15 K with magnetic field applied along c-axis and the anomalous Hall effect disappears above 15 K In summary our magnetic susceptibility data and anomalous Hall effect suggest that the magnetic structure of Co13TaS2 might be not a simple collinear antiferromagnetic structure Non-collinear magnetic structures are expected in Co13TaS2 due to the asymmetric D-M interactions Furthermore the magnetic structure may inherit from the chiral lattice structure to show the magnetic chirality Understanding the nature of the novel magnetic transitions in Co13TaS2 will require detailed investigation of its magnetic structure and chirality Hence we propose to study the magnetic structure and chirality of single crystal Co13TaS2 using polarized neutron scattering method at BT7 triple-axis spectrometer BT7 is capable of polarized neutron beam operation and it is an ideal tool for our purpose Preliminary Work Figure 1 a Lattice structure of Co13NbS2 b magnetic susceptibility of a Co13NbS2 single crystal with Hc the inset shows one photo of our single crystal c magnetic susceptibility of a Co13TaS2 single crystal in magnetic field along ab plane d anomalous Hall effect of a Co13TaS2 single crystal in magnetic field applied along the c-axis We have studied the magnetic susceptibility of our Co13TaS2 single crystal Figure 1b shows the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature at a magnetic field of 01 T Two magnetic transitions are observed at 35 K and 15 K respectively With the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the c axis at a magnetic field H  01 T only one magnetic transition is observed at about 15 K Furthermore an anomalous Hall effect is observed below 15 K with magnetic field applied along c-axis and the anomalous Hall effect disappears above 15 K as shown in Fig 1d Further confirmation of the magnetic structure and chirality in Co13TaS2 calls for a detailed study of its magnetic structure using polarized neutron scattering method Page 2 of 2 Experiment Plan High quality single crystals of Co13TaS2 have been synthesized We propose to study the magnetic structure of Co13TaS2 single crystal by performing polarized neutron scattering measurements as a function of temperature at BT7 A cryostat is needed to reach the temperature window from 15 to 50 K We would like to measure 4 temperature points with T  15 10 25 and 50 K crossing the two magnetic transitions The single crystals are thin plates with a small mass thus we request a total of 4 days to look at these scans for good statistical accuracy Response to Previous Panel This is a new submission Safety Considerations Samples are stable and all measurements are safe References  E A Karhu U K Roler A N Bogdanov S Kahwaji B J Kirby H Fritzsche M D Robertson C F Majkrzak and T L Monchesky Phys Rev B 85 094429 2012  S X Huang and C L Chien Phys Rev Lett 108 267201 2012  Y Togawa T Koyama K Takayanagi S Mori Y Kousaka J Akimitsu S Nishihara K Inoue A S Ovchinnikov and J Kishine Phys Rev Lett 108 107202 2012  S S P Parkin and R H Friend Philos Mag 41 65-93 1980
