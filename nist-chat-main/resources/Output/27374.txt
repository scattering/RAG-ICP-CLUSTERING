Effect of Network Structure on the Polymer Dynamics of Desalination Membranes Peter A Beaucage Christopher M Stafford and Christopher Soles Background Highly crosslinked polyamide thin film composite membranes are the state-of-the-art active material in membranes for desalination and water filtration Despite their broad application at utility scale fundamental questions remain about the molecular mechanisms that allow these membranes to separate ions from water during filtration Membrane transport is typically parameterized by using one of two different models each with different implications on the relationship between the polymer membrane and transport The first describes transport in polymers as a solution-diffusion process where the permeant first solubilizes into the membrane and then diffuses due to the concentration gradient across the membrane In this model the dynamic and molecular interactions between the penetrant and membranes regulate transport The second is a hydrodynamic model which describes the transport of a permeant as a pressure-driven process though a physical porous network with a characteristic pore size This model follows a convective mechanism meaning that the number density dimensionality and connectivity of the pores determine the rate of transport There has been considerable debate as to which model is more appropriate for the polyamides used desalination membranes Several factors have contributed our lack of understanding the molecular mechanisms of transport in these polyamide membranes The biggest factor has probably been our inability to synthesize well-controlled membranes that enable us to quantify the salient transport properties of the permeant inside the membrane - the solubility diffusivity and thereby permeabilityof the membrane material Performance is quantified in terms of permeant flux an intensive parameter that depends on the thickness of the membrane Polyamide membranes are typically made by interfacial polymerization that results in membranes with a nominal thickness of 100 nm but with an RMS roughness that approaches 50 to 100 nm The extreme variability in length of the transport pathway makes it exceedingly difficult to do careful structure-processing-property relationships to relate subtle variations in monomer chemistry to material properties We recently developed a molecular layer-by-layer mLbL process to synthesize molecularly smooth polyamide layers in a manner that eliminates the uncertainty and variability in membrane thickness This has for the first time enabled quantitative structure-processing-properties relationships related to membrane performance We are also now able to produce smooth mLbL membranes in quantities sufficient to perform QENS measurements of the water transport inside the membrane We are now publishing in press our first study comparing the diffusion of water inside a polyamide to water in several other types of membranes Figure 1 plots the diffusion coefficient of water as a function of temperature for a polyamide desalination membrane DM an ion containing alkaline exchange membrane AEM an ion containing Nafion membrane Nafion and a rigid mesoporous silicate mp-Si and free water from QENS and NMR As one might suspect the diffusion of water in the rigid mp-Si membrane a classic example of a convective Figure 1 Diffusion coefficient of water in membranes as quantified by QENS  NMR pore flow membrane is similar to bulk water It is also expected that the water diffusion through the two ion containing membranes which readily solvate water is slower than bulk water and consistent with a solution diffusion mechanism The strong interactions between the water molecules in the membranes and their resident ions retard diffusivity Surprisingly water in the polyamide membrane diffuses like free water suggesting that these desalination membranes operate under pore-flow conditions not solution diffusion This result has been accepted for publication in Macromolecules Prior to these measurements the prevailing notion in the desalination community was that polyamide membranes operated via a solution diffusion mechanism The have been correlations between the carboxylic acid content of the membrane and performance suggesting that the presence of the polar functional groups which interact strongly with water were important for separations To explore this concept we worked with our colleagues at DuPont Water to create a series of polyamide membranes where the carboxylic acid content was systematically varied QENS measurements done last year revealed that diffusivity of water did slow down as the concentration of carboxylic acid groups increased These results will be published shortly However the interpretation was not as straightforward and as clean as we expected As illustrated in Figure 2 polyamides membranes are synthesized by reacting a triacid chloride with some sort of a diamine Our collaborators at DuPont increased the carboxylic acid content by replacing one of the acid chloride functional groups on the monomer with a carboxylic acid moiety In addition to increasing the carboxylic acid content these variations simultaneously decreased the cross-link density of the network This leads to nanoscale heterogeneities of low cross-link density and regions with less resistance to swelling The overall swelling of the membrane upon hydration increases as the carboxylic acid content increases but the swelling becomes more localized and heterogeneous What we are finding is that it becomes difficult to separate the effects of pore-flow and solution diffusion in the membrane Increasing the functional group content does increase the propensity of water to interact with the membrane slowing down diffusion but it also increases the solubility of water in the membrane and increases the size of the water rich domains which is akin to the pore size Preliminary SANS measurements of these hydrated membranes indicate that these domains are on the order of 1 to 5 nm in diameter With this series of membranes it was impossible to cleanly separate the effects of porosity and solution-diffusion for the membrane Proposed Work To tackle this challenge we have developed a new family of block copolymer-based model materials that independently allow for tuning of the network structure pore size and chemistry Briefly the materials incorporate four distinct chemical functionalities into three different blocks a hydrophobic polystyrene A block provides control over the mesophase and Figure 2  Polyamide chemistry showing how incorporating carboxylic acid functionality on the acid leads to locally reduced crosslink density mechanical support A sacrificial polylactic acid or polymethyl methacrylate D block generates pores The midblock which becomes the pore lining is a random copolymer of two different functionalities B-r-C Figure 3 These polymers are synthesized using RAFT in collaboration with Stuart Rowans group These polymers allow both the thickness and hydrophilicity of the pore wall to be tuned using simple chemical substitutions Figure 3 creating a matrix of operating conditions which should bracket the transition between pore flow and solution diffusion mechanisms The work proposed in this study builds on our previous work on RO membrane materials We propose to measure the QENS spectra on DCS to investigate the water dynamics within the hydrated polymer films The polymer membranes are made of hydrogenated material therefore they will be measured while hydrated with both D2O and H2O to differentiate between any motions associated with the polymer and the water molecules via subtraction We expect that at the temperature range of interest we may observe polymer chain motions as well as any restricted water diffusion The translational diffusion of water in the commercial PA membranes was observed in the spectral range covered by DCS For this measurement we will focus on one polymer length scale with four different pore wall functionalities total 4 materials that will be hydrated under two different conditions H2O and D2O The samples will be fully hydrated by equilibrating at 100  RH for 24 hours Each sample will be quenched to cryogenic temperatures then measured on the HFBS spectrometer using a fixed window scan from 5 K to 330 K The resulting mean-square displacement plots will allow us to quantify the fractions of freezing and non-freezing bound water With a heating rate of 1 Kmin each fixed window scan will take 8 h totaling 64 h 53 days of data collection We request 6 full days of HFBS time The full inelastic scattering spectra of the hydrated samples will then be measured at 320 K 300 K and 280 K on the DCS spectrometer We expect that these QENS spectra will be collected for 6 hours based on previous measurements of similar materials totaling 144 h 6 days We request 168 hours 7 days of DCS time to allow for the collection of the vanadium and empty can resolution files This study will complement NMR diffusometry and bulk permeability measurements toward building a cohesive understanding of the molecular rules governing membrane separation processes An estimate of the chemical rules underlying the crossover between pore flow and solution diffusion water transport will allow for further conclusions to be drawn as to the influence of network structure and chemistry on how water is transported through RO membranes ultimately expanding rational design strategies toward their synthesis Figure 3 Block copolymer-derived model membrane architecture processing steps and tunability of final membrane structure via block copolymer design ppq varies the pore wall
