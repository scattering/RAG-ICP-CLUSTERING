Magnetic polaron structure imaged by grazing incidence small-angle neutron scatteringSince their theoretical prediction in 1946  polarons have become a proposed mechanism for many phenomena observed in condensed matter Examples include high-TC superconductivity  to the colossal magnetoresistance in the manganites  From a theoretical point of view what makes magnetic polarons interesting is that they represent electronically inhomogeneous ground states in homogeneous materials such as quantum nematics  Magnetic polarons can form in the paramagnetic state of ferromagnets or the ordered state of antiferromagnets as long as the magnetically correlated volume is smaller that the carrier density For example the starting point for high temperature superconductivity is a lightly doped antiferromagnet As for example pointed out by F Grusdt et al  When a mobile hole is moving in an antiferromagnet it distorts the surrounding Nel order and forms a magnetic polaron Another example for the physics of magnetic polarons are the doped diluted magnetic semiconductors where they are believed to be paramount for the formation of ferromagnetism balancing the normally antiferromagnetic exchange While widely discussed and theorized the existence of polarons has yet to be confirmed directly by experiment The general structure of magnetic polarons is thought to consist of charge carriers dressed with magnetic moments or with lattice distortions The structure of the magnetic polaron has proven difficult to measure in previously studied compounds However the difficulty for polaron detection and measurement has been reduced by the development of materials that are both antiferromagnetic AFM and semiconducting Here we propose to use grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering GISANS to determine the presence and structure of polarons within an antiferromagnetic sample of EuTe We aim to use magnetic fields and light induction to excite polarons and increase their number densityWithin EuTe an itinerant photo-excited electron will couple to the localized large f-electron Eu lattice-spins resulting in regions of aligned Eu moments that collectively have a lower free energy Due to the S72 spin state of the Eu moments found at all lattice sites  the total moment for the magnetic polaron is speculated to be large - on the order of 500 B 27 In 2017 we attempted first SANS measurements on EuTe and trialed the in-situ light induction technique 1 While the use of a LED to excite electrons looked promising our previous experiment in transmission failed due to the thickness of our EuTe crystals 200 m and the low 1e length 90 m of EuTe due to strong absorption by Eu Clearly studying film samples in a grazing incidence geometry would be advantageous This proposal aims to clarify the structure of magnetic polarons and adding to it long standing but unconfirmed theory  that suggests multiple stable polaron structures are possible at finite temperatures but do not directly resolve their structure Figs 1  3 Here we propose using GISANS to probe the existence  structure of magnetic polarons within a thick film sample of EuTe prepared by molecular beam epitaxy MBE on a barium fluoride substrate The samples will be identical to those used by Henriques et al 1 and are provided by the sample grower E Abramof from the Henriques collaboration The low-T AFM state of EuTe will permit easy detection of polarons since they are effectively superparamagnetic SPM regions against an AFM matrix Fig 1 We will use a magnetic fields and a LED one that still works at low temperatures to excite polarons within a sample Once excited into the conduction band the photoexcited electron may be modelled with a Bohr envelope wave function with the local lattice spins being polarised along the electron spin direction at the polaron centre and the lattice spins canting back towards an AFM structure as they approach the edges 1 Given the expected large moment of the polarons only a small applied field 0 H  50 mT will be sufficient to align the polarons along a direction suitable for neutron measurement We plan to orientate our sample so the field is in the plane of the film as in Fig 2 bearing in mind the AFM order we expect this will give a similar response as with field perpendicular like that shown in Fig 1By orientating our samples as shown in Fig 3 with increasing applied magnetic field we expect to see an increase in the scattering in qy as the superparamagnetic SPM moments align with the applied field We plan to use the 9T Horizontal field SCM then with the sample plane horizontal we can rotate the field in the sample plane from being along x to being along y With the field along y GISANS from polarons should decrease with increasing applied field thus confirming the SPM nature of the polarons Having the sample plane horizontal also enables us to translate the SANS detector to attain high qy valuesIn our planned experiment we will i First survey our EuTe film looking for the best film in terms of a surface roughness apparent from broadening in the qy direction at high temperature 150K and b and the visibility of the polaron signal evaluated by examining the GISANS at low temperature 10K at 0 T and at 05 Tii Select the best film to measure the field dependence 9 fields from -05 T to 05 T at two temperatures 5 K  TN and 15K  TN This will establish the expected SPM behaviour iii The cryomagnetic field 05 T will be rotated about the sample plane to directly verify the SPM nature via the field direction dependence of the Halpern- Johnson vectoriv A LED of wavelength 520560 nm will be used to maximise the efficiency of photon induction by keeping the photon energy near to the band gap of 22 eV and minimise heating from unwanted wavelength photons as performed in previous experiment 1 Assuming a minimum polaron radius of 14  a total moment of 545 B and a polaron lifetime of 15 s - we calculate that we need 100 mW cm-2 to see the effect of inter-polaron correlations We expect to see a linear dependence of GISANS from polarons at low LED intensities then interpolaron correlations become significant at higher LED intensities we expect structural peaks in the GISANS potentially even leading into condensation of a polaron lattice While the anticipated polaron moment is large the volume of the polarons is also large meaning the average moment per Eu ion  03 B We therefore anticipate that each GISANS measurement will take  2 hours The required high flux and large dynamic range required to probe these small structures necessitates the VSANS instrument We kindly request 31 days on VSANS from a calculated measurement time of 3 x 3  9 x 2  5 x 2 conditions where we assume x 2 hrscondition  68 hrs plus time for setup cooling 3 samples Any remaining time will be used to explore the temperature dependence andor to look in detail at a second film to establish generality We would need a wavelength configuration of 45  and a q-range from 00003 to 01 -1 For the data analysis will use SasView an open source program developed by NSF to correct for the background high temperatures and extract the q-dependence which we will then compare to theoretical predictions Our measurements will clarify the structure of polarons as proposed by several theories Fig 3 and therefore help elucidate their role across diverse condensed matter systems The study of magnetic polarons are the centre of the thesis of Gabrielle Beaudin the graduate student who is at the centre of this project If met with success this experiment would make her thesis even stronger as she has previously successfully carried out a SANS experiment searching for magnetic polarons in EuB6 a ferromagnetic insulator which has a insulator to metal transition associated with magnetic polarons References1 Pekar Zh Eksp Teor Fiz 16 335 1946 7 Mauger  Mills PRL 53 1594 19842 Alexandrov  Mott Rep Prog Phys 57 1197 1994 8 ILL experimental report exp_5-42-458_171_d33 20173 Jooss et al PNAS 104 13597 2007 9 Mauger  Mills PRB 31 8024 19854 Henriques et al PRB 90 165202 2014 10 Henriques et al PRB 93 201201 20165 Grusdt et al PRX 8 011046 2018 11 Marayuma et al Nuc Int  MethinPhys Res 819 20176 Durst PRB 65 235205 2002
