 Dynamics and phase of triglycerides in synthetic lipid droplet A fat reducing treatment such as cryolipolysis allege that fat is susceptible to low temperatures Consequently local application of low temperature down to 265K to a body part with unwanted fat can be used to decrease fat via destruction of fat cells  A fat cell figure A contains a lipid droplet LD filled with hydrophobic lipids mainly triglycerides TAGs that are surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids with inserted proteins figure B The physical properties of LDs during cryolipolysis are not disclosed We hypothesize that fat susceptibility to low temperature means an alteration of lipid dynamical properties that causes an irreversible damage to fat cell The dynamics of phospholipids assembled in a vesicle have been successfully probed by QENS  The two-component lipid dynamics depends on lipid phase that changes from fluid to gel  at 296 K figure C Elastic incoherent neutron scattering reveals a change in phospholipid dynamics via a step-like increase of scattering intensity on cooling caused by lipid transition from fluid to gel diffusion of lipid and its chains below and above phase transition are sketched based on detailed analysis of QENS spectra Also triglycerides in a low-density lipoprotein isolated from human blood plasma have been probed by QENS  The triglyceride dynamics has been described by a combination of translational jump-diffusion and rotational components These studies point to QENS being a suitable tool to probe lipid dynamical properties To disclose the microscopic mechanism of cryolipolysis we aim to probe the dynamics of TAGs in a droplet by QENS We plan to apply HD labelling to our samples to enhance the scattering from TAGs and to suppress the phospholipid contribution Thus the droplets core will be made of hydrogenated TAGs and the shell out of deuterated phospholipids A saturated lipid has its chains saturated by hydrogen For this reason it reserves more energy than unsaturated lipid  and consequently requires higher temperature to melt gel-to-fluid transition  Considering that we would like to study two types of LD that are with saturated and unsaturated TAGs in the core Apart from mammals LDs are also accumulated in yeast cells and used in biofuel production  Thus revealing dynamical properties of TAGs in LD will be beneficial in several fields such as fundamental lipid research elucidation of cryolipolysis mechanism and manipulation of yeast LD for increasing its energetic value in biofuel production Instrument The proposed experiment aims to probe the microscopic dynamics of lipids in a droplet For this reason the spectrometer HFBS of high energy resolution 1 eV and narrow energy bandwidth 30 eV allows to access the molecular motion time on a scale from 10 ps to 1 ns The length scale from 3 to 63  accessible at HFBS is suitable to probe diffusion of whole lipid and lipid chains Sample and Measurement We will synthesize LDs having deuterated phospholipid shell and hydrogenated core made of a saturated TAGs and b unsaturated TAGs Both types of LDs will be in a deuterated solution to minimize the background signal EINS will be measured on LDs at temperatures of 280-330K every 05K QENS will be measured on LDs at 280K and 330K EINS on cooling and heating cycles with the rate of 05Kmin and QENS at two temperatures on both samples will take about 40 hours Including measurements of empty sample holder and instrument resolution we ask for 2-3 days at HFBS Safety Considerations The samples will be loaded into annular sample holder at biolab Sealed samples will be transferred to HFBS References 1 M M Avram and R S Harry Lasers in Surgery and Medicine 41 2009 2 V K Sharma et al JPCB 119 2015 3 httpsenwikipediaorgwikiLipid_bilayer_phase_behavior 4 M Golub et al Scientific Reports 7 2017 5 httpsenwikipediaorgwikiUnsaturated_fat 6 J M Berg et al Biochemistry 5th ed 2002 7 M Spagnuolo et al Current Opinion in Biotechnology 57 2019
