 Unveiling the Magnetic Structure of CeAuBi2 A Neutron Diffraction Study Topological non-trivial phases are being extensively studied due to their high potential in enabling new technologies spintronics for instance  The presence of unusual quasiparticles like Dirac or Weyl fermions leads to novel transport properties such as ultrahigh mobilities and large magnetoresistance MR that are created by band crossings near the Fermi level In fact nonsymmorphic crystalline structures are predicted to host band crossings  Materials that crystallize in the P4nmm structure in particular host band crossings at M X A and R  Furthermore adding rare-earth elements in the system introduces several effects as magnetism crystalline electrical field CEF effects and Kondo effect The interplay between these effects and topology is rather unexplored in literature The presence of magnetic ordering for instance breaks additional symmetries that may create new topological phases This behavior is observed in CeSbTe in which the application of magnetic fields creates new band crossings as presented in Figure 1 a  Besides being prone to non-trivial phases the P4nmm crystalline structure may present complex magnetic structures In particular CeAuSb2 presents a striped antiferromagnetic order at temperatures below 67 K that evolves to a multi-q phase at low temperatures and high magnetic fields as presented in Figure 1b  In this regard CeAuBi2 is a promising material to the study of the magnetic structures and non-trivial topological phases It also crystallizes in a P4nmm crystalline structure as presented in Figure 1 c Moreover although its properties were already reported 5 -  a complete study of its magnetic structure is still missing Furthermore previous samples presented Au vacancies in which the high amount of disorder may have shaded interesting features of the compound In fact the high quality presented in our single crystals resulted in an antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN of 19 K the highest reported as can be seen in the magnetic susceptibility  as a function of temperature presented in Figure 2 a and b Also the high quality of our samples unfolded several Figure 1 a Electronic band structure in the antiferromagnetic state of CeSbTe extracted from  b CeAuSb2 temperature-field phase diagram extracted from  Crystalline structure of CeAuBi2 metamagnetic transitions at low temperatures when fields are applied parallel to the c-axis At 2 K five regions in the magnetization M data can be identified as shown in Figure 2c The presence of these transitions evidences a competition between ferro and antiferromagnetic magnetic interactions among the Ce3 ions Moreover it strongly indicates an interesting and complex evolution of the magnetic structure as a function of applied magnetic field potentially like CeAuSb2  Remarkably a linear response of the MR was observed at low temperatures and with fields parallel to the c-axis This behavior may be related to the presence of Dirac fermions as observed in LaAgBi2  In contrast to the magnetization we have only observed three different regions in the MR which could be associated to the smaller sensitivity of resistivity measurements to small changes in the magnetic structure Nevertheless the MR of CeAuBi2 presents an overall behavior very similar to CeAuSb2 Figure 3 b which again favors the scenario in which the magnetic structure of CeAuBi2 is changing as a function of field Finally preliminary neutron diffraction ND data were already taken during a short one-day experiment in the BT-7 instrument at NCNR therefore the sample is already prepared at NCNR Those experiments suggested a propagation vector of 0 0 05 similar to CeSbTe and CeCuBi2 3  In fact Figure 4 a presents the evolution of the integrated area of the magnetic peak 1 1 05 as a function of the temperature In agreement to the susceptibility data a TN of 19 K can be observed Also a critical exponent  of 0471 was extracted from fits of the form 5  5G5A5G5G5A25 However additional ND experiments are required to completely solve the magnetic Figure 3 MR for a CeAuBi2 and b CeSbBi2 the last was extracted from  Figure 2 T for fields parallel b and perpendicular c to the c-axis d MH at 2 K for fields parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis structure of CeAuBi2 experiments at zero field and to map the interesting evolution of the magnetic properties of this compound at high field In fact Figure 4 b presents the integrated area of the 1 1 l magnetic peaks where you can see that it is impossible to unambiguously obtain the spin configuration of the magnetic structure of CeAuBi2 solely with these data points Actually the data cannot be simulated by any model such as the -- -- or the - As such it is important to rule out the existence of other coexisting magnetic wave-vector and try to measure additional magnetic peaks to completely solve the zero magnetic structure and map its evolution as a function of field In this regard we propose the realization of neutron diffraction measurements on CeAuBi2 at the BT-7 with the 15 T magnet and the 1 K stick at NCNR At first we will collect more data at 2 K that will enable us to solve the magnetic structure of CeAuBi2 without the application of magnetic fields After that we will investigate the evolution of the magnetic structure as a function of magnetic field applied parallel to the c-axis To investigate the 5 regions of putative different magnetic structures at 2 K we will perform magnetic neutron diffraction at 5 different fields 5 T 69 T 73 T 78 T and 9 T represented by red bars in Figure 2 c Therefore to fully solve the magnetic structure of the promising compound CeAuBi2 which may host both non-trivial topological phases and complex magnetic structures we request 8 days of beamtime We emphasize that these experiments will enhance our knowledge in two different areas of condensed matter physics topology and strongly correlated electron system which the interplay is still not fully understood  L mejkal J elezn J Sinova and T Jungwirth Phys Rev Lett 118 106402 2017  S-Y Yang et al Advances in Physics X 31 1414631 2018  L M Schoop et al Science Advances 4 2 eaar2317 2018  G G Marcus et al Physical Review Letters 120 097201 2018  C Adriano et al Journal of Applied Physics 117 17C103 2015  C B R Jesus et al Physics Procedia 75 618-624 2015  E M Seibel W Xie Q D Gibson and R J Cava Journal of Solid State Chemistry 30 318-324 2015  K Wang D Graf and C Petrovic Phys Rev B 87 235101 2013  C Adriano et al Phys Rev B 90 235120 2014 Figure 4 a Integrated intensity of the 1 1 05 magnetic peak as a function of temperature b Experimental normalized intensity as a function of the reciprocal lattice l
