ScienceEnvironmental Technology Research Centre Yuan Ze University Taoyuan City 320 Taiwan A Scientific Background The Graphene Quantum Dots GQD Polyethyleneimine PEI and polyoxyethylene PEG core-shell-based platforms formation are highly sensitive to the solvent composition and the presence of hydrophilic or hydrophobic molecules which can either interrupt or enhance the polymer self-assembly in solution  The PEI-PEGGQD nanocomposites are effective carriers for druggene and can improve drug uptake and treatment efficacy  This system can load hydrophobic and hydrophilic anticancer drugs like paclitaxel PTX and doxorubicin DOX or RNA encapsulated transfection reagent Multi stimuli-responsive photoluminescent GQD nanocomposites that responded to temperature salts pH and encapsulated organic guests are desirable This project will study encapsulation of doxorubicin DOX drug into multifunctional nanocarrier and their application for neuroblastoma treatment 3- In this context study of the structural information of the drug delivery system DDS in the solution is a necessary step toward a better understanding of the effects of SION andor drugs on the structure dynamics stability and applications of such system for targeted drug delivery Furthermore scattering experiments at different temperatures reveal the structural information of size shape and segment distribution of colloidal particles which is a necessary step toward a better understanding of the drug loading and release mechanism of the thermo-responsive DDS B Aims of Experiment The shape and overall dimension of dispersed nanoparticles and the PEI-PEGGQD core-shell-based platforms were determined using Cryo-TEM DLS and SAXS Further SANS analyses were used to extract information of the interchangeable structural changes of system constituents The detailed analysis of particles dispersion at different temperatures field strength and frequency using SANS studies will be performed in our approved beamtime Using polymers with a deuterated block will lead to the comprehensive study of structural alteration of each block and the nanocomposites in response to the temperature It also gives rise to reveal the underlying druggene loading and release mechanism of nanocarriers C Detailed Description of Experiment To study the variation in core and corona structure of PEI-PEGGQD core-shell consisting of mesoporous GQD PEI and PEG will be used to prepare the nanocarriers for DOX antibody and siRNA delivery to cancer cells The effect of temperature different concentrations of DOX and siRNA on the structure of the blocks will be investigated Scattering experiments for each sample at a continuous q range of 0005  q  04 -1 will be performed Structural changes will be measured at different temperatures of 25-80 oC Additional detailed experiments are required in order to optimize the polymers and nanoparticles concentrations as well as loaded DOX and siRNA D Results of Preliminary Experiments The PEI-PEGGQD core-shell have been investigated for the GQD only GQD-PEI and PEI-PEGGQD core-shell at different temperatures whereby fitting model power-law model  poly-disperse spheres with Schultz size distribution These results show that PEI is not a temperature sensitive polymer The GQD coated with PEI showed a stable size and the particles were about 21 nm in radius The thickness of the core-shell structure of GQD at 37 C is about 36 nm as shown is Fig 1a Furthermore the results revealed that for 25 C or 55 C GQD solution the mean diameter of GQD is 32 nm polydispersity of size distribution  002 Moreover for 25 C PEI-PEGGQD solution the mean diameter of GQD is 46 nm polydispersity of size distribution  002 With regard to PEIGQD solution at 25 C the mean diameter of GQD is 50 nm polydispersity of size distribution  002 Fig 1b In this regard SANS studies are crucial to extract structural information and changes in the environments temperature In this regard SANS studies are crucial to extract structural information and changes in the environments temperature Moreover the increase in temperature caused water depletion in the outer shell resulting in core size gradually becoming larger E Reason for Instrument Choice A key feature of SANS is that it allows different regions of a structure to be probed independently through selective deuteration of the sample It will help to track the druggene due to SLD variation in polymer blocks In this regard SANS studies are crucial to extract structural information upon addition of drugsgene and nanoparticles as well as changes in the environments temperature For this experiment we will use partially deuterated polymers to study structural changes of individual blocks in order to reveal the underlying mechanism of druggene loading and release F An Estimate of the Number of Hours Required As outlined in part C for the structural characterization of the samples we will use Peltier 10P sample changer that will allow for 3 blocks of temperatures 25 37 and 55 to be run in parallel to reduce beamtime The structural characterization of each sample at different temperatures will take about 4 h which for 19 samples 72 h will be required Fig 1 The SANS spectra of a-b GQD GQD-PEI and PEI-PEGGQD at different temperatures b a Power-law scattering surface fractal contributed by other
