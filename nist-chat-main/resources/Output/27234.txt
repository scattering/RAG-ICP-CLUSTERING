Structure of PAN-based carbon fibers in contrast matched environment using USANS and SANS Polyacrylonitrile PAN based carbon fibers with a content of approximately 92 94 carbon have been studied over the past 40 years to increase the mechanical strength modulus and tensile strength using a variety of chemical or physical approaches The pre-oxidation and carbonization stage of precursor fibers have been known to evolve various structure changes that may affect the performance of carbon fibers Especially our group found that a slow heating rate during carbonization process at temperature 1050 oC improves the mechanical performance significantly  In atomic level the networking between graphite layers by quaternary nitrogen atoms can be a reason for performance improvement But it does not explain the difference of mechanical properties of PAN-based carbon fibers which were heat-treated at different temperatures with the same nitrogen content We observed large amount of gases generated during pre-oxidation process and we suspect the gases may trap in the fibers or cause the micro pores in the fibers which may affect the fibers performance The preliminary SANS result nicely show the structure evolution at a particular temperature region and the decrease of background probably due to generation of gases ie the loss of hydrogen content during carbonization process A structure evolution a formation of pores in the fibers is observed at 260 oC - 280 oC as a form of a cross-maltase shape Figrue 1 b and c and then starts to disappear beyond about 280 oC But it is not clear whether the cross-maltase pattern represents the initial stage of pore evolution and why the pattern disappears above about 300 oC In addition strong streaks Figure 1 a at very low angle is also observed which are also observed in USANS measurement This strong low angle signal has been debating in the fiber community whether their origin is from scattering or refraction phenomena We was also advised from our local contact to measure the fibers in a neutron contrast matched environment in order to remove any effect from the surfaces and measure the scattering only from the inside of fibers In this proposal we would like i to measure SANS and USANS for the fibers prepared at 250 oC to find an initial stage structure of pore formation x1 run ii ii to repeat the previous measurements USANS and SANS in the neutron contrast matched environments for the fibers prepared at RT ie original PAN fiber 180 oC  260 oC  and 320 oC The matching solvent will be the mixtures of deuterated and protonated Toluene with total of 4 concentrations x16 runs iii In addition we will re-run SANS only the sample prepared at 280 oC that was measured at insufficient run time in previous experiment and whose background level deviates significantly from other samples x1 run Also the high anisotropy of the fibers may affect to the USANS measurement with the one-dimensional detectors we will also measure the chopped fibers distributed randomly to find a relationship between the isotropic and the isotropic condition and to find a relationship of the USANS data with sector-averaged and azimuthally-averaged SANS data Especially since determining the amount of pores requires a quantitative measurement of scattering it is required to use the well-calibrated instruments and to measure absolute scattering cross-section of the carbon fibers Therefore the USANS and SANS are the optimum instruments to meet our study A relationship of structure-properties of this study is expected to provide insights in designing high-modulus and high-strength carbon fibers The number of samples is 19 ie 18 samples and 1 empty scan Since the neutron scattering contrast matched samples scatters weakly we need to measure long time for SANS and USANS than normal conditions The instruments time for USANS and SANS will take 4 days and 2 days respectively 5hours for each samples x 19 samples  1 empty  96 hrs 4days for USANS 25 hours for each sample including transmission measurement x 19 samples  1 empty  48 hours 2 days for SANS Sample-to-detector distances SDD for the SANS measurement are to be 1m 4m and 13m High Q limit for the USANS measurement is to be about 3x10-3  -1 References  Min-A Kim et al Scientific Report 2016 22988  Strengthened PAN-based carbon fibers obtained by slow heating rate carbonization Figure 1 SANS Images of the PAN-based fibers prepared at different temperatures as shown in label The fibers were loaded in vertical direction Figure 2 circular averaged total crossection against scattering vector of the sampls  The daya will be compared with sector averaging data later A sudden structure evolution clearly shown at 260 oC - 280 oC and then start to disappear beyond that temperature region The background decreases roughly but the background at 280 oC deviates from others
