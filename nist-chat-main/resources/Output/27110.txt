Title  Chain conformation of polyelectrolyte in complex coacervates Scientific Background and Importance Complex coacervation is a liquid-liquid phase separation when two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are mixed in an aqueous solution where the polymer-rich phase is called complex coacervates Fig 1 Since the complex coacervates are formed by electrostatic interaction they are responsive to various stimuli such as ionic strength temperature light etc Besides their unique properties including a liquid interior low interfacial tension adhesiveness and aqueous environment have opened up the potential for the development of wet adhesives biocompatible delivery vehicles and encapsulation1 More recently the formation of complex coacervates has found to be an important process in the mechanism leading to the generation of membraneless compartments in living systems2 However despite its biological and industrial importance there is still a lack of fundamental experimental studies on the complex coacervates that deter further development in a variety of application fields Previously lots of researches have focused on the phase behavior and rheological properties of complex coacervates as a function of salt concentration by using commercially available polyelectrolytes such as polyNN-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate PDMAEMA polydiallyldimethylammonium PDADMA for polycation and polystyrenesulfonate PSS for polyanion34 However since the commercially available polyelectrolytes inherently have wide range of polydispersity and have limited type of charged groups it is not available to investigate the systematic effect of ion pairs ie strength of ion pairs and molecular weight on the coacervate structure Recently a few studies5-7 have investigated on the conformation of single polyelectrolyte chains in complex coacervates using scattering measurement and observed the effects of the salt concentration on the structure of polyelectrolyte complexes However the effects of 1 ion pairs and 2 nearly monodispersed molecular weight on the coacervate structure have not been investigated Furthermore the structure factor ie inter-molecular interaction was not completely excluded in the scattering measurement which is hard to extract only the form factor ie intra-molecular interaction and thus polymer chain conformation In this proposal single chain conformation of polyelectrolyte in well-defined coacervate system will be investigated as a function of ion pairs and molecular weight We synthesized hydrophilic polyethylene-oxidePEO-based polyelectrolytes by using anionic ring-opening polymerization and post-modification of the well-defined parent polymer Therefore each three type of polyelectrolytes bearing different charged moiety were prepared for various molecular weights Also partially deuterated polyelectrolytes-d5 in preparation will be prepared Small angle neutron scatteringSANS is particularly a unique and powerful experimental tool to study single chain conformation because the form factor can be extracted without structure factor in zero average contrast condition8-10 Scientifically theoretical description for the polyelectrolyte structure in the complex coacervate can be improved with a basis of this measurement which eventually allow to better understand and accelerate the development of coacervate-based materials Furthermore we can re-visit the traditionally important issue in SANS that is the polymer chain conformation in a concentrated solution Preliminary Work In order to investigate the effects of charged moiety of complex coacervates three differently functionalizedeg ammoniumA guanidiniumG for polycation and sulfonateS for polyanion polyelectrolytes were prepared by two-step well-defined parent polymers poly allyl glycidyl etherPAGE PDI11 were synthesized by anionic ring-opening polymerization and followed by post-modification to introduce a charged group Electrostatic strength between oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes is modulated by changing their charged moiety and thus significantly different response of complex coacervates to salt concentration Fig 2 manuscript in prep was observed by thermal analysis Weakly associated AS Figure 1 Complex coacervate AS coacervates GS coacervates Figure 2 Number of water molecules per ion pair as a function of salt concentration in complex coacervates and illustration of each coacervate  coacervates are swollen by a large number of water molecules and the value increases with salt concentration which is attributed to attenuated electrostatic interaction between polyelectrolytes However GS coacervates seems less affected by salt concentration and the polyelectrolytes are much less hydrated because of the strong binding capacities of guanidinium moiety With the observation we expect that charged moiety of polyelectrolytes might play a significant role in the single chain conformation of polyelectrolytes in complex coacervates In order to find a solvent condition for zero average contrast matching scattering length densitySLD of both protonated and deuterated complex coacervates needed to be determined Choice of Instrument Small angle neutron scattering SANS performed at NGB 30m SANS beam line is a powerful tool to investigate a single chain conformation using deuterated and protonated polyelectrolytes in an isotopic solvent mixture Also NGB 30m SANS provides wide q range and reasonable flux to capture polymer chain conformation Desired q-range for the experiment  0004 -1  q  05-1 Experiment Plan A Contrast variation experiments will be performed by changing the ratio of H2O and D2O ie background contrast to obtain scattering length density SLD of deuterated complex coacervates Two types of deuterated complex coacervates AS and GS will be prepared in D2OH2O mixture in with different ratio 1000 8020 6040 4060 2080 0100 coacervate 1wt solution  05 hoursamples 6 D2OH2O ratio 2 samples ion pairs  3 hours times for measuring backgrounds  9 hours B Zero average contrast matching Polyelectrolytes coacervates will be prepared in a certain ratio of D2OH2O mixture that meet the condition for the zero average contrast matching  The ratio will be determined from experiment A and the coacervate phase will be collected by centrifugation To investigate the effects of ionic strength SANS will be performed at various salt concentrations between 0 M and 15 M with 03M interval and between 0 M and 45 M with 05 M interval for AS and GS respectively In addition 4 different molecular weights of polyelectrolytes will be investigated to reveal molecular weight effect on the chain conformation All experiments will be performed at target pH and temperature25  1

Two-dimensional scattering data were corrected for detector sensitivity sample transmission empty cell scattering and sample thickness and then azimuthally averaged and reduced to absolute intensity by the direct beam flux method Reduced data will be analyzed with detailed fitting model Since the zero average contrast matching technique will exclusively give the form factor without the structure factor the 1-D SANS profile is primarily reproduced by the Debye model to obtain the radius of gyration7 Therefore the SANS results will provide significant data to extract the single chain conformation dispersed in the coacervates eg concentrated system as a function of salt concentration molecular weight and ion pair References 1 Blocher W C Perry S L WIREs Nanomed Nanobiotechnol 2016
