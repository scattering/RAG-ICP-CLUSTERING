Magnetic Structure of Weyl Semi-metal Candidate Mn3GaYouzhe Chen Jonathan Gaudet Collin BroholmScienti c BackgroundNon-colinear frustrated magnetism can give rise to anomalous transport properties through its impacton the Berry curvature of the conduction electron bands Via strong spin-orbit coupling the electrontransport can be controlled by magnetism with an external magnetic eld which provides potentialtechnology opportunities Conversely new physics may arise from the impacts of magnetism on thetopology of electron bands by generating annihilating or changing the location of Weyl points Thusunderstanding the magnetic structure of magnetic Weyl materials is the rst and crucial step for furtherstudiesThe Weyl semi-metal candidates Mn3X XSnGe receive particular interest due to their anomalousHall and Nernst e ects AHE and ANE at room temperatures 1 The sister compound Mn3Ga onthe other hand exhibit AHE below 200K with a second order structural transition from the originalspace group P63mmc The distorted crystal structure is still under debate 4  Above 200 K theintrinsic AHE vanishes and is argued to be replaced by the domain wall driven topological Hall e ect The in uence of magnetism on the electron transport during the structural transition remains unknownPrevious neutron di raction works re ned a non-colinear chiral spin structure with a gradual canting ofspins when sample was cooled across the structural transition at 200 K 5  Irreducible representationanalysis can prove this chiral spin structure is inconsistent with a small but non-zero spontaneousmoment above 200 K To resolve the con ict a polarized neutron di raction experiment is proposedSample CharacterizationFig 1ab shows the single crystals of Mn3Ga grown by Taishi Chen from Satoru Nakatsujis group using ux method The bulk consists of single crystals stacked along the c axis and co-aligned in the samedirection The orientation of the crystals was con rmed by Laue di raction pattern in Fig 1c Theassembly of crystals is about 05cm in all dimensions and thus su cient big for di raction experimentAfter averaging the chemical composition at 10 di erent locations our SEMEDS measurements foundthe sample is not stoichiometric The measured ratio of Mn and Ga turns out to be Mn  Ga  28consistent with previous reports 5  Fig 1d gives the temperature dependence of the saturatedmoment in two crystalline directions while the anomaly around 200 K is related to the structuraltransition of Mn3GaProposed ExperimentTo understand the magnetic structure above and below 200K we propose a polarized neutron di ractionexperiment on double focusing triple-axis spectrometer BT-7 Polarized neutron beam is essential forthe success of the experiment since unpolarized neutrons are not able to separate the nuclear structurefactors below the structural transition temperature at 200 K Two Mn3Ga crystals will be co-mountedin one Al post One crystal will be in h0 plane while the other one will be oriented in the hh planeso that we can reach Bragg peaks in both planes simultaneously without changing or realigning samplesduring the experiment A CCR is also required to perform experiments at 5 K and room temperaturefor the two phases below and above the structural transition temperature Rocking scans at eachtemperature will take two days with neutron polarized along the momentum transfer and perpendicularto the scattering plane Together with one additional day for unexpected loss of beam-time we request5 days of beam-time on BT-7 to determine the magnetic structure of Mn3Ga1Figure 1 Panel ab image of single crystal Mn3Ga Panel c Laue image of Mn3Ga Panel dtemperature dependence of saturated magnetic moment along two crystal directionsReferences1S Nakatsuji N Kiyohara and T Higo Large anomalous hall e ect in a non-collinear antiferromagnetat room temperature Nature 527 212 20152M Ikhlas T Tomita T Koretsune M-T Suzuki D Nishio-Hamane R Arita Y Otani and SNakatsuji Large anomalous nernst e ect at room temperature in a chiral antiferromagnet NaturePhysics 13 1085 20173A K Nayak J E Fischer Y Sun B Yan J Karel A C Komarek C Shekhar N Kumar WSchnelle J K ubler C Felser and S S P Parkin Large anomalous hall e ect driven by a nonvanishingberry curvature in the noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Ge Science Advances 2 20164H Niida T Hori and Y Nakagawa Magnetic properties and crystal distortion of hexagonal Mn3GaJournal of the Physical Society of Japan 52 15121514 19835M Boeije L van Eijck N van Dijk and E Br uck Structural and magnetic properties of hexagonalMn Fe3 Ga Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 433 297302 20176Z H Liu Y J Zhang G D Liu B Ding E K Liu H M Jafri Z P Hou W H Wang X QMa and G H Wu Transition from anomalous hall e ect to topological hall e ect in hexagonalnon-collinear magnet Mn3Ga Scienti c Reports 7 515 20177E Kr en and G K ad ar Neutron di raction study of Mn3Ga Solid State Communications 8 16531655 19702
