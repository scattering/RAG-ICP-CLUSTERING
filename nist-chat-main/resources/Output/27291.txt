Spin Dynamics of the Charge Disordered Pyrochlore 162Dy2ScNbO7 a Spin Ice Perturbation Cole Mauws Christopher Wiebe Introduction and state of science In pyrochlores of the form Dy2B2O7 and Ho2B2O7 where B is a non-magnetic transition metal the classical spin ice state is consistently seen The classical spin ice state is a well-studied magnetic glass that provides an opportunity to study magnetic monopolar quasiparticles that exist as a topologically protected excitation within spin ice This state is driven by the dipolar interaction of these large moment ions  10 B being larger than any exchange contribution  As such the magnetic ground state does not change in response to changes in lattice constant driven by B-site substitutions We have been studying the charge disordered pyrochlore Dy2ScNbO7 where a solid solution of non-magnetic ScIII and NbV occupy the B-site In this case of large chemically driven disorder on the B-site we observe glassy behavior distinct from the classical spin ice observed in all other dysprosium pyrochlores This provides an opportunity to study a perturbation on the classical spin ice which includes faster spin dynamics and therefore larger monopole concentrations if monopoles do still appear in these systems Here we plan to track the spin dynamics of Dy2ScNbO7 to see if they follow a distinct pattern of spin ice that includes a temperature independent quantum tunneling regime Clancy et al 2009  use backscattering to track the spin dynamics in Ho2Ti2O7 our attempt at muon spin relaxation suggests that Dy2ScNbO7 may also show interesting dynamics in the backscattering frequency range In particular we are attempting to see if we can observe a region of non-Arrhenius dynamics characteristic of spin ice We did not observe this within our the 1-1000 Hz frequency window and attempts to measure the decay Previous results Dy2ScNbO7 has been investigated by AC susceptibility specific heat measurements muon spin relaxation neutron diffraction and neutron crystal field spectroscopy AC susceptibility fig 1 right shows a frequency dependence which is not consistent with spin ice but shows an Arrhenius behaviour with an excitation energy of around 3 K if there is a plateau region it exists at higher frequencies Specific heat measurements show a peak around 12 K integration shows entropy release of roughly 90 of the spin ice entropy again showing this behaviour seems to a slight difference from spin ice Neutron diffraction was taken at HB-2A at dilution temperatures this data was taken on natural abundance dysprosium so the data quality is limited Diffuse scattering was observed fig 1 left which is not consistent with the well characterized spin ice scattering A rudimentary RMC fit was attempted due to the poor data quality the fit was largely disordered but did show a slight preference for anti-ferromagnetic nearest neighbor correlations This data will be improved with planned polarized experiments on the isotopically enriched sample Muon spin relaxation measurements show abnormally fast relaxation outside of their observable time window  1 s suggesting that backscattering neutron spectroscopy will probe a reasonable time range Crystal field results on 162Dy2ScNbO7 from sequoia are the motivation for this study fig 2 In the parent compound Dy2Ti2O7 the lowest excited electronic state is at 20 meV  well separated from the ground state and no inelastic magnetic signature from the spin ice ground state is observable except quasielastic scattering at extremely low  1 eV energies Our studies of Ln2ScNbO7 pyrochlores show that broad crystal fields are expected due to the chemical disorder however we see a new excitation appear in Dy2ScNbO7 centred at 52 meV with a FWHM of 64 meV significantly overlapping the ground state The excitation appears to be a crystal field however a better temperature dependence is required to determine whether it is magnetic in origin This low lying crystal field may provide a low energy non-Ising state which would partially explain the deviation from spin ice This overlapping crystal field could also provide a mechanism for the rapid relaxations

162Dy2ScNbO7 powder for neutron scattering studies This experiment is being coupled with an experiment on DCS The DCS experiment will track the inelastic excitations as a function of temperature and observe whether or not the excitation is gapped The HFBS measurement will track the quasielastic scattering within the ns range too fast to observe using DCS The elastic peak will be fit using a pseudo-Voigt profile with a fixed Gaussian resolution This should let us extract relaxation rates from the Laurencin width This should allow us to determine if the relaxation is non-Arrhenius as shown for Ho2Ti2O7 in Clancy et al 2009  Excitations should be expected to fall off with Q and data cuts in Q may be used to confirm this However for the dynamic fits we intend to integrate over all Q in order to keep our counting times reasonable The 15 g sample of 162Dy2ScNbO7 is mounted in an Al can and will be mounted in a 18 K base cryostat Measurements will in the 49 Hz monochromater frequency
