Transport of solvent-in-salt electrolytes based on deep eutectics Scientific Background and Technological Impact We seek to expand our study of structure-transport-dynamics correlations in novel electrolytes commonly referred to as solvent in salt electrolytes or SISE which have shown to have considerably large voltage windows12 The concentration of Li within these SISEs are upwards to 10-25 M meaning that there are 2-3 solvent molecules per Li ion While these electrolytes have expanded voltage windows 3 V they cannot be used in commercial devices because of poor ionic conductivity This can be overcome by incorporating a stable soluble yet non-interacting species into the electrolyte This decreases the viscosity and allows the increase in self diffusion of molecular species Here we seek to look at transport of a new class of electrolytes eutectic in salt electrolytes EISE The objective of this experiment is to understand how moving from a simple solvent in salt to a binary solvent in salt system affects transport of the solvating molecule Aims of the Proposal We want to describe how acetonitrile dynamics are affected by the combined effects of ion coordination and co-solvent interactions As stated above SISEs have greater stability than their diluted counterparts however ionic transport rates are much slower in the bulk By adding a soluble non-solvating species such as dichloromethane or chloroform anions and cations may be more readily separated This would decrease the viscosity and allow the ions to move more freely and lead to increase in conductivity In fact we have shown this to be true Fig 1 shows the dramatic improvement of ionic conductivity by adding chloroform to the nonaqueous electrolyte An improvement of near 4 orders of magnitude at 223K is obtained Here our goal is to provide a clear description of the dynamic changes involved in such remarkable increase in ionic conductivity By selective deuteration we can look at the transport of the solvating species acetonitrile and the non-solvating species chloroform The obtained results will be related with viscosity and ionic conductivity measurements to understand transport mechanism in these systems Additionally molecular dynamics simulations of such a system are currently being performed in collaboration with Cummings group in Vanderbilt and will aid in understanding QENS data Figure 1 conductivity data of the ternary electrolyte solution of chloroform acetonitrile and LiTFSI as varying acetonitrile loading The star corresponds to conductivity of 13 mixture of LiTFSI and acetonitrile at 223K 263K and 293K 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 38010-710-610-510-410-310-210-1Conductivity s ScTemperature T  CHLOROFORM 1  160 AN LI_TFSI 1M CHLOROFORM 1  071 AN LI_TFSI 1M CHLOROFORM 1  0267 AN LI_TFSI 1MChoice of Instrument Since we seek to investigate protons self-diffusion in the above systems HFBS is the choice of instrument Because protons have one of the largest total scattering cross-sections the QENS signal from the protiated solvents will be strong Exploring HFBS and its narrow elastic resolution we will be able to describe very slow motions at temperatures around the eutectic point of the electrolyte The collected data will be complementary to the data collected at the BASIS spectrometer in SNS The latter experiment is already approved and will be conducted in December2019 Hence I full dynamical map will be possible by the combination of BASISs and HFBSs potentialities Experiment Plan The chosen system will be lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide LiTFSI dissolved in acetonitrile at 13 saltsolvent To this mixture deuterated chloroform will be added to form a deep eutectic solvent from which acetonitriles QENS signal will be observed Sequentially LiTFSI will be dissolved in deuterated acetonitrile D-AcN and hydrogenated chloroform H-CF will be added to the mixture In this case chloroforms dynamics will be observed and we hypothesize that it will drastically affect the dynamics of acetonitrile We will seal the samples in 025 mm Al flat cans using indium gaskets to minimize multiple scattering DSC and TGA suggest that the samples are stable up to 373K and crystallize at 183K Therefore we would like to conduct elastic fixed window scans between 200 - 273K and based on these experiments we will select three temperatures to collect full QENS spectra We estimate 6 hours per QENS measurement Upon completion of the H-AcND-CF and D-AcNH-CF QENS measurement we will look at the effect of CF concentration by adjusting the concentration to under eutectic and over eutectic thus giving us a total of 6 samples - 3 with deuterated chloroform and 3 with deuterated acetonitrile Given the number of samples 6 not counting an empty Al can that also needs to be measured and the time needed to measure the resolution function from the samples cooled down to the baseline temperature we request 6 days of beamtime The team members will use several QENS data analysis packages including Mantid and Dave to extract spatial and temporal information on the molecular motion in SISE Safety Considerations Samples will be preloaded into sample holders and sealed in our lab The sealed samples do not present additional hazards All safety precautions will follow the local guidelines References 1 Yang C Chen J Qing T Fan X Sun W Cresce von A Ding M S Borodin O Vatamanu J Schroeder M A et al 40 v Aqueous Li-Ion Batteries Joule 2017 1 122-132 2 Suo L Borodin O Gao T Olguin M Ho J Fan X Luo C Wang C Xu K Water-in-Salt Electrolyte Enables High-Voltage Aqueous Lithium-Ion Chemistries Science 2015 350 938-943 3 Mahurin S M Mamontov E Thompson M W Zhang P Turner C H Cummings P T Dai S Relationship Between Pore Size and Reversible and Irreversible Immobilization of Ionic Liquid Electrolytes in Porous Carbon Under Applied Electric Potential Appl Phys Lett 2016 109 143111-143116
