Observation of moisture exchange between fresh mortar and substrate saturated with water using neutron radiography Shanbin Xue Peng Zhang Kaiyue Zhao Qingdao University of Technology Qingdao 266033 PR China Scientific context Cement-based material is one of the most widely used building materials in the world Unfortunately cement-based materials suffer serious deterioration under the compound action of loading temperature salt corrosion during its service Laying fresh mortar on the damaged cement-based materials has been a common method to repair and strengthen the structure Water exchange between the fresh mortar and the substrate occurred once a moisture gradient was created between the two materials The water exchange will inevitably alter the water-cement ratio of fresh mortar and disturb the cement hydration influencing the bonding between the repair mortar and the substrate eventually2- Several factors control the water exchange between fresh mortar and substrate including the water saturation and microstructure features of substrate the origin water-cement ratio of fresh mortar and the types of additives in the fresh mortar A real-time visualization test is much meaningful for modeling water exchange between fresh mortar and substrate and make clear the formation process of interface microstructure References  Thomas Dyer Concrete durability 1st ed CRC Press 2014  CJWP Groot Effects of water on mortar-brick bond Delft university of technology 1993 httpresolvertudelftnluuid800957d5-50e0-4bc4-8996-e83e3b4d5487  A Wetzel M Herwegh R Zurbriggen F Winnefeld Influence of shrinkage and water transport mechanisms on microstructure and crack formation of tile adhesive mortars Cem Concr Res 42 2011 39-50  Z Jian Performance of engineered cementitious composites for concrete repairs Delft university of technology 2011 httpresolvertudelftnluuid4bc07d00-4455-4c38-b97e-5a06e77d9ce7  C Marliere E Mabrouk M Lamblet P Coussot How water retention in porous media with cellulose ethers works Cem Concr Res 42 2012 1501-1512 Necessity of neutrons radiation use Because neutrons are particularly sensitive to hydrogen neutron radiography was considered to be very suitable for detecting the dynamic water content distribution when a fresh mortar was cast on a porous substrate Moreover neutrons have unique advantages in distinguishing isotopes When a fresh mortar manufactured with heavy water D2O was applied on a substrate saturated by ordinary water H2O obvious water exchange is expected to be observed by neutron radiography and the quantitative analysis can be performed with calibration results Preliminary work Our group has rich experience in the application of neutron imaging to investigate water transport in the cement-based material and rocks by cooperation with Paul-Scherrer-Institute China Institute of Atomic Energy and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin We have acquired and analyzed some neutron images of water transferring from a fresh mortar to an old hardened mortar as shown in Figure 1 It indicated neutron radiography is an effective method to monitor water content change in the fresh and hardened mortar Figure 1 Quantitative analysis of water transfer from fresh mortar to an old hardened mortar Experimental plan The influences of heavy water content of fresh mortar and the types of substrate and its initial water content on water exchange between fresh mortar and old hardened mortar will be focused in this test The experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 2 A brief description of the experiment is as followings 1 Acquire open beam dark filed images and neutron images of the substrate 2 Apply fresh mortar with different heavy water-cement ratio 04 06 on the different substrate old mortar old concrete with various relative water contents 03 06 10 and acquire the neutron images A detailed description of the sample can be found in Table 1 3 12 hours beam time is needed for each test and 12 types 223 of tests are planned Therefore total 144 hours beam time is expected for this experiment and the experiment arrangement is shown in Figure 3 SpecimenNeutronDetectorCollimatorSource Figure 2 Neutron radiography of moisture exchange between fresh mortar and porous substrate Table 1 Descriptions of the samples Fresh mortar Old mortar Samples Fresh mortar heavy water-cement ratio Substrate initial water content M1 Cement mortar 04 Mortar 03 M2 Cement mortar 04 Mortar 06 M3 Cement mortar 04 Mortar 10 M4 Cement mortar 06 Mortar 03 M5 Cement mortar 06 Mortar 06 M6 Cement mortar 06 Mortar 10 C1 Cement mortar 04 Concrete 03 C2 Cement mortar 04 Concrete 06 C3 Cement mortar 04 Concrete 10 C4 Cement mortar 06 Concrete 03 C5 Cement mortar 06 Concrete 06 C6 Cement mortar 06 Concrete 10 Task D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 Sample M1 Sample M2 Sample M3 Sample M4 Sample M5 Sample M6 Sample C1 Sample C2 Sample C3 Sample C4 Sample C5 Sample C6 Figure 3 Schematic diagram of experiment arrangement
