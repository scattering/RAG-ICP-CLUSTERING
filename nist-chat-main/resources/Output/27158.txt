Standards and Technology Gaithersburg MD 20899 USA Scientific Importance The melding of the mathematics of topology with the fields of condensed matter and materials physics has brought about a revolution in how these communities think about the electronic and magnetic properties of quantum materials  One important class of these materials are Weyl semimetals WSMs which contain linear dispersions at band crossings similar to the more famous Dirac cones found in two-dimensional graphene  However in WSMs either time-reversal or spatial inversion symmetry are broken This splits the Dirac point into two Weyl nodes and creates the ability to study how magnetic order external fields and structural distortions alter band topology and macroscopic observables In addition WSMs tend to exhibit high mobility topologically-protected surface states large magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect AHE which make them strong candidates for a multitude of device applications such as spintronics quantum computation and catalysis  Preliminary Work Over the last few years a series of publications has provided strong evidence that thin films of the pseudo-cubic perovskite EuTiO3 ETO grown compressively strained on LSAT substrates are topological Weyl semimetals that display both the anomalous and topological Hall effects 3 While undoped EuTiO3 is G-type antiferromagnetic AFM insulator even a small amount of A-site doping with trivalent Lanthanide elements eg La Sm produces an itinerant magnet with a small spontaneous magnetization  The associated AHE displays a remarkable sign change as the carrier concentration crosses a threshold at n  4x1020 cm-3 This crossover behavior is well explained by electronic structure calculations that show the presence of Weyl points in the conduction band at precisely these doping levels and thus the sign change of the AHE can be understood as a change in the spin chirality of the carriers across the Weyl node  In addition the authors found a non-monotonic term in their Hall effect analysis that is attributed to the so-called topological Hall effect THE A THE is a signature of nonzero Berry curvature due to a real-space non-coplanar spin texture  and its presence in Hall effect measurements suggests such a spin texture exists within these ETO films A canted AFM structure has been proposed as the origin of this THE signal and this picture is consistent with both the small hysteresis and net magnetization observed and the reduction in THE signal with increasing field However an intriguing alternative has come to light following some exploratory polarized neutron reflectometry PNR measurements These measurements shown in Fig 1 reveal the presence of a thin 2 nm ETO layer near the substrate that displays a ferromagnetic FM state at low fields within error of the full 7 BEu moment expected of a collinear spin arrangement On the other hand magnetization in the bulk of the film increases gradually with increasing field until saturating near 2 T The bulks behavior is consistent with either an increased AFM canting angle or a growing FM phase fraction across a metamagnetic transition Yet in either picture it is reasonable to expect non-coplanar spin textures at the interface between the thin FM interfacial layer and either the AFM or mixed phase bulk of the ETO film In other words the presence of this interfacial FM and the boundary between it and the bulk magnetic structure create another possible source of the observed THE signal Experimental Plan To better understand the origin of this interfacial magnetic layer in ETO and whether it is contributing to the THE signal we propose to collect similar PNR measurements on a film of the undoped parent compound which will show whether the presence itinerant carriers is required to observe the enhanced interfacial magnetism This sample has already been grown and characterized as part of a series of neutron diffraction measurements shown in Fig 2 Measurement Details To collect our PNR measurements we request use of the Polarized Beam Reflectometer PBR at NCNR and the 7 T magnet with He-3 insert This is the only sample environment setup at PBR or any reflectometer we know of that will reliably achieve temperatures below 1 K such that ETO is in a completely saturated state It is also the same setup used to collect the PNR and neutron diffraction results presented above To mimic our preliminary data set non-spin flip PNR measurements would be collected at a base temperature of 350 mK after field cooling under 2 T Reflectivity would be measured at fields of 2 T 1 T 05 T and 001 T quasi-remnance This procedure allows us to capture and compare the field-dependent evolution of both the bulk and interfacial portions of the sample thereby placing bounds on the possible magnetic structures in each Our plan thus consists of four reflectivity scans From previous experience with this instrument and cryostat setup we expect each field condition scan to take 18 hrs or 3 days in total Adding one day for overhead to align and cool the sample we request 4 days of beamtime to collect our proposed measurements
