 1 Influence of Interfacial Electrostatic Interactions on Shear Thickening Behavior of Concentrated Colloidal Suspension Scientific Importance Concentrated colloidal dispersions show shear thinning and shear thickening behaviors and such non-Newtonian behaviors arise from microstructural changes induced by shear Understanding what drives shear thickening can provide avenues to reduce energy dissipation in chemical and food processing and thus is of tremendous importance in many industrial processes The flow of dense suspensions glasses and granular materials is heavily influenced by molecular interactions at the interfaces between constituent particles To date neither hydrodynamics nor intermolecular interactions have successfully explained the full range of flow phenomena in concentrated suspensions In this project we propose to understand the role of interfacial electrostatic interactions on shear thickening behavior of concentrated colloidal suspension through fine-tuning surface charges of colloidal particles in conjunction with rheological measurements in different shear regimes and in situ neutron techniques Such non-Newtonian behaviors arise from microscopic behavior such as particle-particle interactions and particle dynamics under shear and the microscopic behavior may not be homogenous over the entire volume Rheology measures macroscopic mechanical behavior of dispersions but is not able to measure the microstructure induced by shear Very Small Angle Neutron scattering vSANS is the most suitable technique to measure dynamic microstructure because of its high spatial and temporal resolution and broad Q range A rheometer has been commissioned in the beamline to simultaneously measure rheology and SANS study Therefore Rheo-SANS will provide detailed structural and dynamical information of these colloidal suspensions under shear and correlate particle-scale phenomena to the behavior and dynamics of larger-scale systems Experiment Plan and Data Analysis Silica particles with a diameter of 1252 nm log normal distribution   0058 will be suspended in a mixture of D2O and H2O The wave-vector range accessible at vSANS in its standard configuration for transmission SANS is well suited for measuring form factor and structure factor of silica in our target size To have a well control on the interparticle interactions we plan to functionalize silica particles with different end-tethered charged polymers Figure 1 It can be anticipated that either positively or negatively changed polyelectrolytes will significantly increase their viscosity while the end-tethering lubricating zwitterionic polymers will less increase the viscosity in comparison with those of bare silica colloidal suspensions We plan to investigate one bare silica particle suspension as the control and six polyelectrolyte end-tethered silica particle suspensions with the volume fraction of 05 In addition six different ionic strengths by adding 2 potassium chloride into the solvent with concentrations of 0 025 05 075 1 and 125 mgg medium respectively to adjust the interparticle interactions Rheo-SANS measurements will be performed from the shear-thinning region of colloidal solutions to the shear-thickening region at shear rates of 01 03 1 3 10 30 100 300 600 and 1000 s-1 To understand the connection between the rheological behavior of suspensions of charged colloids under steady shear and their microstructural evolutions we will use the spherical harmonics expansion approach to address the connection between the directional dependence of the measured spatial correlation functions and the flow mechanism1 It has been shown that the anisotropic pair distribution function 5T225_ is most relevant to the shear deformation For an elastic solid that undergoes homogeneous deformation its corresponding 5T225_ has been shown to be proportional to the derivative of the isotropic component 5T005_ where 50 is the macroscopic shear strain Surprisingly for the steady flow of charged colloids a quantitative agreement between 5T225_ and is found within the probed range of shear rate The characteristic variation of 5T225_ is seen to be in phase with that of  This observation suggests that the mechanical response in a time-averaged manner is nearly elastic With an increase in shear rate the disagreement begins to develop To quantify the evolving mechanical response we extend Eqn 1 to Eqn 2 retains the general form of Eqn 1 but the local strain is allowed to depend on the radial distance r We found that the elastic deformation is sustained over a certain range over which the sheared particles deform collectively in an affine manner We call this range the transient elastic zone TEZ A specific length scale 5 can be defined to characterize the profile of 55_ 5 is identified as the reciprocal rate at which the elastic deformation about a central colloid decrease with distance Within 5 the solid-like elastic deformation dictates the mechanical response Beyond Fig 1 Chemical structures of the end-tethered polymers on silica particles 3 this spatial extent the solid-like behavior is progressively deteriorated by the increasing gas-like viscous displacement The existence of a TEZ demonstrates the heterogeneity in the mechanical response It is not a surprise that like high density liquids colloidal suspensions will accommodate short lived elastic responses Our results demonstrate that in sheared colloidal suspensions the colloids are dynamically correlated over a certain distance Therefore we demonstrate for the first time that the concept of elasticity can be applied to describe the local response of colloidal suspensions under steady shear The time-averaged size of TEZ 25 can be used in gauging the mechanical response of colloidal suspensions to applied shear We found a gradual loss of elastic coherency by a decrease in 25 from approximately 95Q to 25Q where d is the particle diameter as the shear rate increases from 5  1 51 to 5  300 51 Within the lifetime of a TEZ its constituent colloids are highly correlated dynamically As a result the modulus of a TEZ is expected to be higher than that of a plastic flow region within which the colloids are relatively uncorrelated More energy is required to free a colloid from its immediate surrounding in a TEZ than in the plastic flow region We therefore identify the local elastic coherency manifested by the TEZ as the key mechanism controlling the rheological behaviors of colloidal suspensions with strong interactions To facilitate the Fourier transform of the measured SQ to gr it is critical to explore the Q range from 0002  Q  1 nm-1 Based on our previous experience both spectra from 1-2 and 1-3 planes are required to obtain the complete information of structural distortion Given that the good statistics over the entire Q range we request 3 days of beam time on vSANS 2 days for the 1-2 plane and 1 day for the 1-3 plane Reference 1 Z Wang T Iwashita L Porcar Y Wang Y Liu L E Snchez-Daz B Wu G-R Huang T Egami W-R Chen Local elasticity in nonlinear rheology of interacting colloidal glasses
