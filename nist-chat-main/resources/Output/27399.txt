A rheo-vSANS study of the transient out-of-equilibrium self-assembled microstructure of diblock bottlebrush polymers Matthew Wade1 and Simon Rogers1 1University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department Background and Problem Statement Understanding how the self-assembled microstructure of polymeric materials is affected by strong out-of-equilibrium flow conditions is a crucial and outstanding problem for additive manufacturing specifically and soft matter science in general  Rheological and scattering approaches have been used to probe the underlying dynamics and inherent structure of bottlebrush polymers under equilibrium conditions 2 3  but little is known about how such materials respond to printing-like conditions Equilibrium studies of diblock bottlebrush polymers DBBs in both melt and solutions phases have explored the self-assembly of these materials into highly uniform micelles and lamellar microstructures 5 6  These studies have begun to provide an understanding of the interactions between individual bottlebrush polymers and establish DBBs as ideal building blocks for promoting uniform self-assembly in printed polymer systems While a reasonable understanding of bottlebrush polymers under quiescent conditions has been established very little has been done to relate the rheology and microstructure of these materials Previous rheo-VSANS and rheo-microscopy measurements collected during steady shear clearly demonstrate the need to characterize DBBs in non-equilibrium conditions Across both studies sample microstructure and color are observed to vary with shear rate figure 1 Such behavior is a clear indication of a structure-property-process relation between shear rates sample color and microstructure Figure 1 a Representative rheo-VSANS scattering in the flow-vorticity 1-3 plane for DBB in solution at the lowest accessible q q  00015 -1 to 002 -1 b Representative rheo-VSANS scattering in the flow gradient-vorticity 2-3 c Representative shear rate sweep and corresponding images taken using a microscope in the 1-3 shear plane for a DBB solution Open squares indicate a lack of observable color All data was collected using samples with a concentration of 175 mgml and were held at a temperature of 5 C throughout testing Images collected through transient rheo-microscopy during shear startup demonstrate that the observed color changes take place over the course of less than 1 s The stress response of the material under these conditions appears to equilibrate around the same time as the color at approximately 055 s figure 2 This correlation suggests a quantifiable rapid reorganization of the microstructure immediately after transitioning from a quiescent to a sheared state Through transient rheo-VSANS we seek to explore this transient microstructural evolution in DBB solutions during shear startup in greater depth c a b Figure 2 a Images from the rheo-microscope depicting rapid color change of a DBB solution during shear startup for shear rates of 30 s-1 and 100 s-1 The time difference between each image is 011 s b Applied stress for a DBB solution during shear startup Lines have been included as guides to the eye All data was collected using samples with a concentration of 175 mgml and were held at a temperature of 5 C throughout testing We propose conducting a comprehensive series of startup-shear and cessation rheo-VSANS studies in both the flow-vorticity 1-3 and flow gradient-vorticity 2-3 planes to capture multiple projections of the 3-D microstructure of the DBB and its development from quiescence to steady state under a variety of shear rates The VSANS instrument at NIST gives us access to an unparalleled range of length scales allowing us to simultaneously capture structural changes at high and low q With this instrument it is possible to relate the hierarchical dynamics inherent to bottlebrush polymers 2  to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions The largest length scales accessible in VSANS grants insight into the long-range self-assembly characteristics of DBBs thus providing details of the overall uniformity of the DBB structure in solution Videos and images of the sample taken in house under equivalent conditions will be related to the microstructure allowing us to establish a relation between the development of the microstructure and the resulting color Given the remarkable images and steady state scattering already obtained we expect this work to be of great interest to the additive manufacturing and soft matter communities and will therefore feature in a high impact-factor journal article Previous rheo-VSANS tests carried under steady shear demonstrate the feasibility of this study At the lowest accessible q count rates were on the order of 85 countss and 1875 countss in the 2-3 and 1-3 planes respectively As such it is possible to complete a series of time-resolved measurements in a reasonable time frame in both configurations Proposed Study We propose to run a series of tests that combine VSANS and rheology to capture the development of the self-assembled microstructure of DBBs in solution during startup shear in the 1-3 and 2-3 planes The DBB considered for this study is polynorbornene-g-polylactic acid60200-b-polynorbornene-g-polystyrene45200 the same polymer previously characterized under steady shear conditions The polymer sample will be dissolved in deuterated toluene to form a solution with a concentration of 175 mgml Throughout the experiment the sample will be held at a constant temperature of 5C to limit the effects of evaporation on solution concentration The microstructure will first be characterized under quiescence followed by a series of transient measurements during startup shear and shear cessation A total of 6 different shear rates spanning from 001 to 1000 s-1 will be tested reflecting the range probed in figure 1 a b 001011101102103 Pa Time s 30 s-1 100 s-1All startup shear and shear cessation tests in the 1-3 plane will be carried out in the Anton-Paar 501 Rheometer currently available at NIST The 50 mm quartz cup and 48 mm titanium bob will be used so that sample volume and thus concentration can be monitored throughout the study Deuterated toluene will be added to the sample as needed to ensure the concentration remains constant Scattering will be collected in the 1-3 plane by aligning the geometry such that the neutron beam passes straight through the center of the cylinder Time resolved startup-shear and shear-cessation studies will be carried out according to the procedure described by Lopez-Barron et al  where shear startup and shear-cessation are repeated until sufficient scattering events are recorded over an interval of time The rapid dynamics associated with DBB polymers require a small bin width of 01s to properly resolve the development of the microstructure To collect at least 100000 scattering events per bin the experiment will be repeated 1250 times Shear will be applied for 15 s followed by 15 s of relaxation which is more than 10 times the samples relaxation time We expect measurements at each of the selected shear rates to take a little less than half an hour to complete Scattering in the 2-3 plane will be obtained by shifting the position of the geometry to the tangential configuration such that the beam passes through outer edge of the concentric cylinder The same 6 shear rates tested in the 1-3 scattering plane will be tested in this configuration Based on the count rates from our previous rheo-VSANS experiment the experiment will have to be repeated 12000 times to collect 100000 scattering events per bin We expect each shear rate in the 2-3 scattering plane to take approximately 10 hours to complete Including setup and alignment of the rheo-SANS instrument we propose to use 3 days of beamtime on the VSANS beamline A few hours during the first day will be dedicated to running shear startup and cessation and steady shear tests in the 1-3 plane The remaining time will be allocated to running shear startup and shear cessation tests in the 2-3 plane The following calculations were used to determine how much time would be needed for each configuration In the 1-3 plane 6 5_5N5a5R5  305O5V555_5N5a5R 1000005P55b55a55O5V5
