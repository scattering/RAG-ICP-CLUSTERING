 Background and Motivation Magnetic skyrmions show promise for future data storage applications due to their topological protection and the existence of skyrmion lattices SkL at a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields As demonstrated by Jonietz et al  and Okuyama et al  the SkL in the cubic helimagnet MnSi can be rotated using electrical currents of order j  106 Am2 This is remarkably smaller than the roughly 109 Am2 required to drive magnetic domain walls through racetrack memory devices If skyrmions can be utilized in a similar racetrack device this difference would represent a six order of magnitude reduction in the power consumption of such a device vs present domain wall technology An electric current exerts two forces on a chiral SkL a drag force parallel to the current and a Magnus force perpendicular Fig 1 When these forces are sufficiently large they can overcome pinning effects and drive a translation of the SkL Since translations are not easily observed in scattering experiments Jonietz et al and Okuyama et al instead converted theses forces into torques on the SkL by introducing a temperature gradient and by pinning the SkL along the edges of the sample respectively This torque rotates the SkL away from its preferred orientation with respect to the crystal lattice an effect which is easily observable with SANS While these approaches are clearly feasible both rely on a secondary effect to convert the Magnus drag force into a torque on the SkL Here we propose an experiment which directly generates a Magnus torque in MnSi opening the door for direct observation of SkL-crystal lattice coupling and potentially new skyrmion devices Experiment Plan We propose to use a Corbino geometry to drive the SkL of MnSi into rotation without pinning or thermal gradients Fig 2 By forcing the current to move radially the perpendicular Magnus force on the SkL will be azimuthal in direction rotating the SkL about the center of the device By using SANS to observe this rotation as a function of current through the device we will for the first time Figure 1 Forces exerted on the SkL of MnSi An additional thermal gradient has allowed the Magnus force to exert a torque on the lattice Figure 2 A Current flow through Corbino disk B Magnus force exerted on the SkL C Drag force exerted on the SkL be able to directly map the free energy of the SkL-crystal lattice interaction as a function of angle Additionally we anticipate that the radial decay of current density in the Corbino device will produce new phenomena in the SkL which can be observed with SANS Namely since the skyrmions near the center of the disk will experience a greater Magnus force than those along the outside edge there will be an azimuthal shear strain on the SkL This effect will be visible as an azimuthal broadening of the SANS Bragg peaks Furthermore the drag force will also decay with radius exerting a compressive strain on the lattice This would be visible as a radially broadening of the Bragg peaks At sufficiently high currents we may even observe a breakdown of the SkL into a skyrmion liquid phase much like L
