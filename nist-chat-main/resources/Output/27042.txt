Song  Jianjun Cheng Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Urbana IL 61801 USA Scientific Importance Synthetic polypeptides are an important class of biomaterials which show excellent biocompatibility and can adopt stable protein-like ordered secondary structures like -helices and -sheets1  Polypeptides have shown promising properties in several biomedical fields including drug delivery gene delivery tissue engineering and antibacterial applications The ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides NCAs is the only reliable way to prepare high molecular-weight polypeptides in large scale We recently developed the covalent cooperative polymerization CCP of NCAs in solvents with low polarity such as dichloromethane DCM and chloroform  The two-stage polymerization proceed in a much faster manner compared with conventional polymerization in polar solvents which not only provides new understanding on the enzyme catalysis but also allows us to greatly simplify the synthesis of well-defined polypeptide materials In an attempt to further elucidate the CCP mechanism we recently studied the linear polymerization of NCA in DCM initiated from n-hexylamine Figure 1a The polymerization kinetics showed a typical two-stage cooperative feature Figure 1b where the polymerization rate of the second stage k2 was faster than that of the first stage k1 with the transition happened when the propagating polypeptides adopt a stable -helical structure In addition the reversible binding between NCA and the N-terminus of a propagating helical polypeptide was confirmed by both saturation transfer difference NMR and molecular dynamics simulation which facilitated the ring-opening of NCA in an enzyme-mimetic manner Therefore the catalytic power of a simple -helical structure was demonstrated for the first time which resembles that of a complex three-dimensional enzyme Motivated by the interesting polymerization behavior we further applied a Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic model to describe the polymerization behavior in DCM where a reversible binding of NCA to the chain terminus with an adsorption rate of kon and a desorption rate of koff was incorporated Interestingly we observed the dependence of k1 and konkoff on the starting concentration of initiators 0 but not the starting concentration of monomer 0 Figure 1c Such 0-dependent feature was not observed when the polymerization was conducted in polar solvents like NN-dimethylformamide DMF or dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO This result indicated that the aggregation of helical polypeptides in DCM further catalyzed the CCP of NCAs However the aggregation behavior and mechanism how aggregated polypeptides catalyzed the polymerization are poorly understood Therefore studying the aggregation of helical polypeptides in DCM is crucial for us to elucidate the CCP mechanism which will further guide our design of new polymerization systems Preliminary Work Previous SANS data obtained from QUOKKA in ANSTO were shown in Figure 2 The samples were 22 mgmL of poly-benzyl-L-glutamate50 PBLG50 in either DCM or DCMDMSO 11 volume mixture It is clear to see that with the DCMDMSO as solvent a plateau region can be observed from q  0008- 002 -1 On the other hand an intensity increase can be observed for PBLG50 in DCM which suggests us different aggregation behavior of PBLG50 happened in different solvent polarity Then the scattering patterns were fitted by a cylinder model since PBLG forms helical structure The obtained radius and length of the aggregated PBLG50 in DCMDMSO is 95 and 654  respectively According to a previous study the radius and length of single chain PBLG50 is 75 and 75  Hence we observed a monomeric PBLG50 in DCMDMSO However the low-q deviation of the model from the scattering data with DCM as solvent suggests that a wider q range with lower q values is required to accurately determine the dimensions and the aggregation behavior of PBLG50 in DCM The vSANS provides the ideal q range for this study Choice of Instrument Small angle X-ray scattering SAXS was considered a possible method to characterize the polymer structure However there are two major issues with SAXS Firstly The X-ray transmission of DCM  0001 and DMSO  1 is about 40000 and 40 times less than that of H2O based on a sample thickness of 1 mm by using a CuK radiation Secondly the lowest q for SAXS accessible is around 0006 -1 which makes the SAXS measurement almost impossible to probe the desirable q range Therefore the extended low q  00002 -1 range and high penetration of neutron for chlorine-containing samples makes vSANS the ideal instrument We Figure 1 Covalent cooperative polymerization CCP of N-carboxyanhydrides NCAs

length L with a polydispersity of 02 The red orange and green curves stand for a cylinder with R30 L600 R10 L600 and R10 L300  respectively The low q plateau can be used to calculate the radius of gyration The initial decay point from plateau to q-1 and the slope transition point from q-1 to q-4 corresponds to L and R respectiely Experiment Plan and Data Analysis In this proposal we are aiming to understand the aggregation behavior of different degree of polymerization of PBLGs in different solvents We are interested in PBLG15 PBLG50 and PBLG100 in DCM DMSO DMF THF DCMDMSO and DCMDMF DCMTHF We will use 66 33 and 165 mgmL for the concentration of PBLG15 22 11 and 55 mgmL for PBLG50 and 11 55 and 275 mgmL for PBLG100 The chosen concentration is consistent with the kinetic study we had already done The data will be fitted with a cylinder model to obtain the radius and the length and we will be able to know the aggregation behavior is either head-to-head side-by-side or both can happen in different solvents We estimate a data collection time  1 hr  sample and therefore we request at least 72 hrs to complete the data collection Response to Previous Panel NA Safety Considerations All the samples will be prepared at the proposers home institute Proper Personal Protective Equipment PPE will be worn all the time when running experiments DMF and THF are flammable
