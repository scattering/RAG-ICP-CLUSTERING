Tuning RKKY Interactions and Spontaneous Superconducting Vortex Formation in Rare-Earth Borocarbides -II This proposal is going to be the continuation of a project which has been started at NCNR in May 2018 We have been awarded SANS beamtime at NG7 SANS instrument and we have completed several measurements on pure ErNi2B2C and Er1-yHoyNi2B2C crystals with y025 and y050 The first SANS measurement was conducted on the pure ErHo2Ni2B sample The sample is composed of 6 co-aligned single crystals shown in Fig 1a For the very first trial we used an Al plate to hold these crystals However the Al plate was accidently bent during the sample insertion in to the magnet so we changed it to a Si wafer holder The observed vortex-lattice VL pattern can be seen in Fig 2 As seen from this figure which is captioned from the GRASP analysis program the peak positions of different temperature data are all in the vicinity of q00051 -1 which is the calculated q position for the applied magnetic field strength of H1180 G The reason we had such a specific value for the magnetic field was due to control issues with the persistent switch During the first two days we realized that the controller for the 9T horizontal magnet is not as sensitive at the low magnetic field set values as it was for the high H values Therefore we put a multimeter serial between the magnet and persistent switch to control the current The current we read corresponded to H1180 G so we continued our measurements with this value checking with the reading of the multimeter The same problem also made our H0 measurements difficult In order to be consistent we collected the background scattering at T15 K with H field of 1180 G For these measurements between T7 K down to 27 K we collected VL scattering signal in the pattern of a square-like This is shown in Fig2a The spots on the corners of the VL are elongated blobs with weak intensities for this range temperature while for the low temperatures the spots become sharper However because of the change in the background scattering below T27 K specifically for T19 K and T23 K data we cannot analyze our VL with a simple T15 K background subtraction as we did for the high temperature data which worked just fine The I vs q profile of the observed VL pattern for T  7K to 19 K is shown in Fig 2b As may be seen we observed a peak center qo change where qo increases as we lower the temperature towards the weak ferromagnetic FM phase This is evidence of spontaneous VL formation due to the effect of the FM phase which sets in at T23 K However because of the background change observed at T 25 K data it is hard to analyze the lowest temperature data and make this figure clearer and pronounced Figure 1 The pure 6 ErNi2B2C single crystals aligned on a Si Wafer The Cd metal sheet is used to screen the Al holder and decrease the background scattering intensity In order to fix these problems and collect clearer data we plan to have a bigger one pure ErNi2B2C crystal Our sample grower Dr Cho will prepare the sample for us and we will align it before for the SANS beam-time We hope with this new sample we will clearly see an increase in the qo of the VL indicating the effect of FM phase as if an extra H field has been applied The square VL has been observed in several different studies before 1- The observed pattern shown in Fig2 should be studied at slightly lower field values in doped and pure samples This might make the shape of our VL pattern clearer This way we can deduce if the observed pattern is a result of superposition of hexagonal vortices slightly misaligned to each other becoming a square or not This was observed in YBCO Niobium before 3 Besides this we managed to finish the investigation of our y025 and y05 samples within the first SANS beam-time as well The VL observed for the half-half sample was very weak This is shown in Fig3a with a very weak intensity at the calculated q position shown in Fig3b However our y025 sample did not show any VL intensity at all This might be a troubling result at first however after NG5 Spins measurements we realized that the overall magnetic behavior seen in the y025 sample is really more suitable to a sample of y075 meaning our more Er-doped sample is in fact a less Er-doped sample This can be deduced by the short-ranged order SRO anti-ferromagnetic AFM incommensurate ordering seen in y075 which looks more like Ho than Er This is shown in Fig4 An EDX measurement which is planned after the neutron investigation is over will show this with certain quantitative analysis as well To conclude we are applying for a 4-day follow-up experiment In this experiment we plan to study the y075 doped crystal -which is in fact to say Er025Ho075Ni2B2C sample- for H1180 G and a slightly lower H value The difficulties we faced in the first 2 days of the first run taught us how to use the magnet We also will try to set the magnet to the zero field and collect the H0 background data as well We aim to finish the y075 sample first Then we will continue with the half-half sample and collect the second field data including the H0 background This part will be done in 25 to 3 days The remaining time will be dedicated to the pure sample We hope to have a complete set of data a b Figure 2 The VL patter at T19 K is shown in panel a while in panel b the peak positions Iq are shown for T7 5 3727 and 19 K data especially for the two doped samples which we can calculate the other parameters such as penetration depth etc for all of the samples which show VL intensity 1

diffraction obtained from 2 doped samples with the pure HoNi2B2C Panel a shows the magnetic diffraction namely from Er075Ho025Ni2B2C -which is actually the Er025Ho075Ni2B2C sample as explained in the text This panel looks more similar to the last panel panel c which shows the magnetic behavior for pure HoNi2B2C crystal As it was studied before pure ErNi2B2C does not have any magnetic diffraction in this plane That way the sample namely Er025Ho075 Ni2B2C -which is actually Er075Ho025Ni2B2C- sample shown in panel b looks like the pure ErNi2B2C diffraction Therefore this naming issue is resolved by only considering more Er in the name means less Er in reality a b c a b Figure 3 Er05Ho05Ni2B2C SANS pattern The T15 K background is subtracted from T3 K foreground data in panel a and the I vs q
