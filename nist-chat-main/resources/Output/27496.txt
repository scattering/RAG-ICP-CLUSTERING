Page 1 of 3 Effect of Polymer Dispersity on Conformation of Polymer Brushes Grafted on Nanoparticles Tzu-Han Li Jacinta C Conrad Megan L Robertson University of Houston Scientific Importance Nanoparticles functionalized with pH-responsive polymer brushes have many promising applications in biomolecule adsorptiondesorption and inkjet printing among others due to the ability to tailor the polymer conformation and particle size through control over pH1-4 Although theoretical models predict the brush conformation direct measurement of the brush conformation and relationship of conformation to polymer molecular weight distribution remain underexplored In particular the impact of polymer dispersity a measure of the breadth of the polymer molecular weight distribution on the conformation of pH-responsive spherical polymer brushes has not been studied Our objective is to quantify the conformation of pH-responsive weak polyelectrolyte brushes grafted on nanoparticles as a function of polymer dispersity  degree of polymerization 5A  and pH using small-angle neutron scattering SANS Systematically understanding the effect of these tunable parameters on the pH-responsive conformation will enable the use of these smart materials in wide variety of applications We will build upon prior results in which we utilized dynamic light scattering DLS to measure the hydrodynamic radius Rh of polymer-grafted nanoparticles as a function of   5A and pH and compared to theoretical models56 In the proposed experiments we will obtain SANS data on pH-responsive polymer-grafted nanoparticles with various polymer  and 5A directly quantifying the pH-dependent brush conformation and length and brush pKa Preliminary Work Our previous work has explored the effect of dispersity  on the conformation of neutral polytert-butyl acrylate PtBA-grafted nanoparticles in tetrahydrofuran THF by DLS and SANS with grafting density  035 chainsnm2 We observed distinct impacts of  on brush conformation for brushes of low and high 5A Brush length  5Y5O  characterized with DLS was plotted as a function of weight-average degree of polymerization 5A5d Figure 1a When 5A5d  200 a scaling behavior of 5Y5O  5A5d080 was observed as expected for the concentrated polymer brush CPB regime High-dispersity brushes in this regime were up to twice as thick as low-dispersity brushes for a given 5A5d However at higher 5A5d brushes with varying  collapsed onto a master curve scaling as 5Y5O  5A5d067 as expected for the semidilute polymer brush SDPB regime Figure 1a56 We chose selected brushes for SANS characterization in which 5A5 was held constant and  varied Figures 1b and 1c The solvent for SANS experiments 5347 vv mixture of THFd8  THFH8 was chosen to match the scattering length density of the silica nanoparticle core Figure 1 a PtBA brush length as a function of Nw The scaling exponents of brush length with Nw  200 are greater than 08 CPB while the scaling exponent is 067

density of the brush linearly increases as a function of distance from the nanoparticle surface due to the inhomogeneous volume fraction of solvent through the brush layer9 55P55  55C5P55_5R5  5A5P

high Nn brushes Figure 1b the low q cutoff of the data was not sufficiently low to capture the low-q plateau expected from the model Thus the results of this data fitting are highly inaccurate as can be seen in the large discrepancy between DLS and SANS Table 1 Our proposed experiments will address this gap through the use of VSANS We have also probed the effect of  on the conformation of pH-responsive PAA brushes grafted on silica nanoparticles at varying pH using DLS If we first examine the low Nn series Figure 2a the hydrodynamic radius 5E of the high  brush significantly increased with pH Surprisingly 5E of the low  brush was independent of pH Figure 2a A decrease in zeta potential Figure 2b and increase in UVVis absorbance Figure 2c of both brushes was observed with increasing pH indicating similar changes in charge and degree of dissociation1011 with pH regardless of  We hypothesize that the low 5A5d and low  brush had already adopted an extended conformation at low pH and the contribution of electrostatic repulsion due to dissociation of carboxylic acid groups to the brush conformation was negligible12 However at higher  more free volume was available for polymer chains to collapse at low pH and they were extended due to the strong electrostatic repulsion among dissociated carboxylic acid groups when pH was increased13 We plan to test this hypothesis with the proposed VSANS experiments Figure 2 a Rh and b zeta potential of PAA brushes of similar low Nw and varying  as a function of pH c UVVis absorbance of the low Nw and low  PAA brush at various pH Experimental Plan Conformation of spherical PtBA brushes in THF We have developed controlled syntheses of spherical PtBA brushes with constant 5A5 and 5A5d but different  The varying effects of dispersity on PtBA brush conformation in THF at low and high 5A has been investigated via DLS We plan to explore the brush conformation with identical tuning parameters using VSANS We will use the core-chain model to fit a b c Page 3 of 3 VSANS data extracting the brush length and core radius Further we will follow procedures established by Hore et al 8 in which the CPB and SDPB regions of the brush have different scattering length densities through targeted use of deuterated monomers during the brush synthesis and known cutoff Nn for the transition from CPB to SDPB regimes quantifying brush conformation within each regime with the use of the core-chain-chain model The SANS analysis will also allow quantification of scaling exponents for lb as a function of N and identification of the threshold between CPB and SDPB regimes To collect SANS data we will disperse the selected spherical PtBA brushes into 5347 vv THFd8THFH8 at 20 to match the scattering length density of the solvent to the silica core With a dilute concentration 03 wt the structure factor from interparticle interactions can be neglected Conformation of spherical PAA brushes in aqueous solutions of varying pH We will hydrolyze the spherical PtBA brushes choosing brush pairs in which Nw is held constant yet D varies VSANS experiments will explore the brush conformation as a function of pH N and D The spherical PAA brushes will be dispersed into 4456 vv H2OD2O at 20 in which the solvent scattering length density is matched to the silica nanoparticle core The dilute concentration 03 wt of PAA-grafted nanoparticles avoids interparticle interactions Justification for VSANS SANS is the most effective and direct method to measure brush conformation The ability to match the solvent scattering length density to that of the nanoparticle core allows for directly probing the polymer brush region of the polymer-grafted nanoparticle When further selectively deuterating the inner region of the polymer brush one can separately probe the CPB and SDPB regions of the brush8 While DLS can be employed to quantify the overall Rh of the polymer-grafted nanoparticle the contrast is not easily varied it is difficult to probe different regions of the brush CPB vs SDPB and one cannot easily determine the overall brush morphology ie spherical cylindrical etc We are requesting time on the VSANS instrument specifically as our prior SANS experiments Figures 1b and 1c indicate the need for access to low q ie lower than 0003 -1 for polymer-grafted nanoparticles with high Nn Sample availability Sample are immediately available Justification for beamtime request We anticipate analyzing 12 PtBA-grafted nanoparticle samples for which each pair of samples has the same Nn yet differing D at 20 C Additionally we anticipate analyzing 6 PAA-grafted nanoparticle samples for which each pair of samples has the same Nn yet differing D at 20 C and at varying pH 7 pH values ranging from 3-10 Based upon our prior experience collecting SANS data on the PtBA-grafted nanoparticle samples on NGB30 and at HFIR we anticipate that it will take around 30 min to collect data at each pH for each sample We plan to conduct multiple pH cycles first increasing and then decreasing pH as our prior work13 identified hysteretic memory behavior in PAA brushes grafted to flat substrates We therefore estimate a need for 6 h of beamtime to probe PtBA-grafted nanoparticles and 60 h to probe PAA-grafted nanoparticles With additional background measurements we therefore request 3 days of beamtime Safety considerations When handling volatile chemicals eg tetrahydrofuran it is necessary to have proper PPE gloves lab coats safety glasses and conduct experiments in a fume hood Need for access The proposed experiments cannot be conducted with any instrument other than SANS and VSANS allows for unique access to low q data with high flux These experiments are a critical component of the PhD
