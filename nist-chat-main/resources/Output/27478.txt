SANSUSANS Study of Flowable Electrodes for Capacitive Deionization Noah Cho and Jeffrey J Richards1 1Department of Chemical  Biological Engineering Northwestern University Motivation Advanced economies across the globe increasingly require sustainable and affordable infrastructure to meet the basic needs of their growing populations An ongoing challenge to address this demand is to deliver new and better technologies that are both cost competitive with existing infrastructure but also produce lower environmental impacts over their operational lifetimes Increasingly climate change has forced some communities in the United States to consider water security as a key component of their infrastructure investment In these communities the use of brackishsea water treatment is seen as part of a solution to ensure sustainable access to a potable water supply Existing desalination technologies including reverse-osmosis RO membranes however suffer from poor scalability and high operation costs Emerging alternatives include flow-assisted capacitive deionization FACDsup1sup This technology promises a balance between scalability and efficient purification The enabling feature of FACD is the suspension electrode  Suspensions electrodes consist of conducting particles suspended in a fluid medium These particles provide a continuous electrically percolated network which is necessary to mediate electron transfer from the current collectors to capture ions from the salt-water Carbon black is frequently used in this application due to its low cost and its electrochemical stability 3 Unfortunately while carbon black can provide the necessary electrical performance its presence has a detrimental effect on the rheology of the active fluids 5 Understanding the microstructural origin of these high viscosities is critical to realizing efficient and scalable FACD technologies  Preliminary Work In prior work on this topic we have measured the quiescent microstructure of carbon black suspensions in propylene carbonate In collaboration with the University of Delaware who have developed a protocol to acquire structural information from RheoUSANS measurements on carbon black suspensions in shear flow we have worked to understand this connection with the electrical properties In general we observe that agglomerates of carbon in suspensions form hierarchical structures spanning the 100nm- 20m length scale These large agglomerates erode with increasing shear stress and break down self-similarly This structural trajectory leads to shear-thinning due to the reduction in the effective volume fraction of the agglomerates and the liberation of solvent However it also has a dramatic influence on the electrical properties of the slurry While this appears to a robust relationship for carbons in mineral oil and propylene carbonate it is not yet established for aqueous suspensions in concentrated salt solutions Therefore we seek to establish that these rules hold in water in contexts relevant to CDI Aims In order to stabilize the carbon in aqueous solvents we have oxidized it using concentration sulfuric and nitric acid mixture This renders the surface functional with carboxyl and sulfonate groups that proffer colloidal stability of the primary aggregates at modest volume fractions We aim to measure the structural change of the primary aggregates at varying levels of oxidation using SANS and USANS at a variety of loadings and salt concentrations We further seek to examine the break-down of this structure in shear flow SANSUSANS measurements are crucial to examining this structure as water has excellent neutron contrast with carbon Experimental Plan We are primarily interested in studying the carbon black microstructure as a function of loading and salt concentration in these dense slurry suspensions Therefore the form factor of the carbon black suspensions will be established over the entire Q-range accessible in USANS and SANS This distribution of microstructure will be compared used to understand the evolution of the structure factor that we anticipate being predominate at low-Q in the USANS regime We will further complement these measurements with Rheo-USANS experiments that subject gelled suspensions to simple shear We anticipate running up to 3 samples in RheoUSANS with 6 shear rates with 4 hour acquisitions each and therefore request a total of 3 days of USANS time We further request 1 day of SANS time to acquire the form-factor of the oxidized carbon black suspensions in water References 1 Duduta M et al  Adv Energy Mater 2011 1 511-516 2 Vaynberg K a et al  Biomacromolecules 2000 1 466-472 3 De Kruif C G et al J Chem Phys 1985 83 4717 4 Porcar L et al Rev Sci Instrum 2011 82 083902
