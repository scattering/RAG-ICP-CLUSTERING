Measuring the effect of cholesterol on the bending rigidity of a eukaryotic asymmetric plasma membrane mimic Scientific Background Plasma membranes PMs are prevalent in living cells and have developed pronounced characteristics Intrinsically these membranes form spherical shapes whereby elastic constants such as the bending modulus  can be assigned and used to determine the physical nature of the membrane More specifically  can quantify thermally-induced dynamic processes of the membrane such as membrane thickness fluctuations and rigidity  which has profound biological relevance It affects PM structure and therefore PM function influencing protein-PM interactionsinsertion lipid rafts and vesicle formation to name a few  The PM has evolved to contain two compositionally distinct leaflets where high-melting and uncharged lipids are mainly located in the outer leaflet and low-melting and negatively charged lipids on the inner leaflet Consequently this lipid composition difference contributes to significant variances in physical and mechanical properties between the two layers Using the bending elasticity as determined by  we can ascertain details about the interleaflet coupling between asymmetric leaflets and the overall effects on the bilayer The near ubiquity of asymmetric membranes in nature signify that symmetric model systems are not adequate in characterizing PM properties To our knowledge the majority of research has been conducted on the bending rigidity of symmetric systems due both in part to the experimental difficulty in preparing asymmetric vesicles and fundamental difficulty in determining  for each leaflet In addition bilayer asymmetry contributes additional dynamic processes and influences mechanical properties leading to a lack of research conducted on the interplay between the monolayers  Previous Results We have previously examined the bending rigidities of an asymmetric vesicle and compared it to symmetric controls allowing for the direct evaluation of asymmetrys role on the mechanical properties of lipid bilayers  In the natural progression towards more biologically-Figure 1 A Decay rate ZG normalized by Q3 averaged for all Q

lipid phase states and may play a role in both a bilayers overall bending rigidity and the coupling between leaflets 5 Elucidating cholesterols effect on bilayer mechanical properties will help provide insight on its role in PMs and help develop a robust membrane mimic suitable for further biophysical studies With length-scales of 01-10 nm and time-scales of 01-100 ns neutron spin echo NSE is ideal in resolving the minute motions eg membrane fluctuations and rigidity present in bilayers  NSE will then be used to measure these samples at varying temperatures allowing us to observe the change in bending rigidity with respect to monolayer phase changes This experiment will allow us to expand our knowledge on how the physical nature namely the phase behavior of one leaflet affects that of the other leaflet and lead us forward in our understanding of the biological consequences of such lipid compositions We will use a recently published technique that we developed to prepare stable tensionless asymmetric large unilamellar vesicles aLUVs containing cholesterol which can be used for biophysical studies  Using this technique previously prepared isotopically asymmetric vesicles showed the same bilayer thickness and area per lipid as its purely symmetric counterpart  This highlights the effectiveness of our asymmetric preparation in producing stress-free structurally-faithful vesicles We have shown that asymmetric bilayers with a ESM outer leaflet and POPE inner leaflet no cholesterol demonstrate no appreciable loss of asymmetry within 5 days even at two temperature points  This reflects the stability of our prepared vesicles where no signs of vesicle fusing can be seen and asymmetry levels are affected by mainly the passive phospholipid flip-flop rates which is on the order of days to weeks This makes our asymmetric vesicles suitable for NSE where each measurement can range from 8-24 hours Using NSE we have previously measured the bending modulus of such cholesterol-free aLUVs possessing an inner leaflet predominately 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphoethanolamine POPE and an outer leaflet with egg sphingomyelin eSM Fig 1A is a normalized experimentally measured decay rates from our recent measurements Fig 1B shows the  of the aLUV and symmetric controls of its inner and outer leaflet where no direct relationship can be observed Our data suggests that the stiffness of an asymmetric membrane is dictated by the more rigid leaflet Fig 1C and that coupling of two leaflets with independent physicochemical properties introduces new contributions to the internal dissipation within the bilayer  Moreover the strong interleaflet coupling observed here is entirely driven by lipids indeed lipids may be the major driving force for coupling in natural membranes as peripheral proteins have not demonstrated such an ability  While the membranes presented here mimic the asymmetric distribution of ordered and disordered lipids found in mammalian plasma membranes they are by no means representative of the compositional complexity of a living PM Most importantly they lack cholesterol the most abundant lipid species in the PM and a molecule that has been suggested to play a role in interleaflet coupling For these reasons incorporation of cholesterol into these bilayers will yield insights regarding whether cholesterol inhibits promotes or even influences interleaflet coupling at all in asymmetric membranes Aims of Proposed Experiments and Estimate of Beamtime We propose to use NSE to measure the bending rigidity of 200 nm asymmetric unilamellar vesicles ULVs at a concentration of 30 mgml The vesicles will be compositionally asymmetric with a sphingomyelin outer leaflet and a POPE inner leaflet matching the predominant compositions of eukaryotic plasma membranes The aLUVs will then undergo another exchange step with cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin to dope the aLUVs with cholesterol ranging from 10-30 mol  cholesterol 5 10 20 30 to further mimic natural plasma membranes  and probe its effect on bending rigidity in asymmetric membranes As a complement we will also measure the respective bending rigidities of the symmetric LUVs for pure ESM and POPE as well as the one with the same composition but chemically scrambling our aLUV Consistency in leaflet compositions will be ensured as preliminary preparations have shown that the phospholipid exchange efficiency remains constant despite cholesterol loading Further by completing the asymmetric sample measurements within three days though the stability of the leaflet compositions is on the order of weeks  The temperature dependence of the bending rigidity will be determined by measuring the twelve samples at 30 and 50 C This temperature range is ideal to yield two phase separated measurements a phase with a gel outer leaflet and a fluid inner leaflet and finally a fluid - fluid phase We disregard the low temperature gel - gel phase due to time and that in cholesterol-free aLUVs no change in bending rigidity was observed in our previous investigation between symmetric and asymmetric vesicles Samples will be loaded into 4 mm NSE cells and measured with 8 and 11  neutrons to examine features in the 004-01 -1 range and Fourier times up to 100 ns The NSE data will be analyzed following the Zilman-Granek theory of membrane fluctuations equivalent to our recent study  This investigation will allow us to answer how asymmetry coupled with cholesterol affects membrane bending rigidities and thickness fluctuations We expect each sample to require 10 hours per temperature condition For twelve samples each at two temperatures along with D2O solvent background and resolution measurements  15 days we request 12 days of beamtime References  Phys Rev Lett 2012 109 058102  Chem Phys Lipids 2006 144 146-159  Chem Commun 2015 51 6976-697910  Nanoscale 2019 accepted  Biophysical Journal 1993 646 1967-1970
