Neutron Research National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg MD 20899 USA 1 Introduction to the Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator MnSbBi2Te4 MnBi2Te4 an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator has recently been predicted to possess a variety of topological quantum states including quantum anomalous Hall insulator axion insulator in its 2D thin layers and an ideal Weyl semimetal state in its bulk ferromagnetic FM phase 1 This material has recently been synthesized and it crystallizes in a rhombohedral structure with the space group 5E35Z which can be viewed as a natural heterostructure of magnetic layers MnTe intergrown with topological insulator layers Bi2Te3 3- as shown in Fig 1b The prediction of novel quantum states noted above has attracted a great deal of interest 46-1 Recent experiments have shown that by partially substituting Sb for Bi its Fermi level can be tuned from the bulk conduction band to the bulk valence band and the ferrimagnetic ground state is observed in the MnSb2Te4 polycrystalline sample 11-1 Our previous studies revealed MnBi2Te4 exhibits an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect AHE in an intermediate field range 35-77T and such an AHE originates from the Berry curvature induced by a non-collinear spin structure  Additionally we also successfully synthesized a series of MnSbxBi2-xTe4 single crystals and find the sample x  18 shows ferromagnetic behavior in contrast to the antiferromagnetic order previously found for other members of the MnSbBi2Te4 family 11121 However there are many questions to be addressed about the details of the magnetic phase diagram in this system as well as other family members of MnSbxBi2-xTe4 By this proposed experiment on BT-7 we hope to measure the field dependence of the magnetic state of the MnSb18Bi02Te4 single crystals and use a polarized beam in zero field to determine its magnetic structure The determination of such a magnetic structure would facilitate the understanding of the development of the ferromagnetic ground state in microscopic details 2 Preliminary Work on MnBi2Te4 A series of MnSbxBi2-xTe4 single crystals from x  0 MnBi2Te4 to x  20 MnSb2Te4 were successfully grown by a self-flux method Polycrystalline samples of x  10 were also synthesized via the solid-state reaction  The previous studies have demonstrated this material family is indeed built of the stacking of Te-SbBi-Te-Mn-Te-SbBi-Te septuple layers SLs along the c-axis Fig 1b 3471 SLs are coupled through van der Waals bonding Previously we have elucidated the coupling between the bulk electronic and magnetic properties on MnBi2Te4 and explored how the nontrivial surface states are related to magnetism We find when the magnetic field is applied in the out-of-plane direction the system evolves into a metastable canted AFM CAFM state prior to polarized to a ferromagnetic state as illustrated in Fig 1c Fig 1d shows the Hall resistivity measurement where the field is parallel to the c-axis In CAFM state we observed an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect not coupled with magnetization indicating the presence of net Berry curvature in momentum space In addition we observed a magnetic phase transition at Tc  26 K and a clear hysteresis loop in the isothermal magnetization measurement on MnSb18Bi02Te4 single crystal suggesting this sample has a ferromagnetic ground state The susceptibility and its isothermal magnetization data are shown in Fig 1e and 1f respectively The remnant magnetization of this compound can reach up to 06 Bfu with a coercive field of Hc  310 Oe The saturated magnetization is 18 Bfu Currently we need microscopic details to determine the origin of the ferromagnetic ground state that developed in this composition Initial elastic neutron measurements taken on the BT-7 and BT-4 triple-axis spectrometers TAS at the NIST Center for Neutron NCNR as well as powder neutron diffraction PND measurements taken on the BT-1 diffractometer also at NCNR confirm a k  0005 antiferromagnetic ground state for the x  2 compound similar to the x  0 compounds but also illustrates that the spin flop transition occurs at much smaller applied field and does not appear to have the intermediate CAFM ordering Our powder neutron diffraction data as well as single crystal x-ray diffraction data On MnSbBi2Te4 suggests that this modulation of the magnetic ordering may be related to site mixing between the Mn and Sb atoms Furthermore for the stoichiometries with the non-standard anomalous Hall signature as shown in Figs 1 g and f we observe a new set of magnetic peaks in neutron powder diffraction at a second ordering temperature consistent with a broad response of dc magnetometry The indexing of the propagation vector of these reflection is still unclear though nominally we have indexed it to 14   from powder diffraction data Solving the magnetic structure of this system and its dependence on the Mn site occupation and Sb content is critical for determining the origin of the anomalous transport Fig 1 a Crystal image and b structure of MnSbxBi2-xTe4 c Magnetotransport and torque measurements on MnBi2Te4 at Hc The system evolves into a

Work The major remaining question in this system is two-fold are the new reflections identified in powder neutron diffraction PND measurements magnetic in nature and what is the magnetic structure which leads to both an enhanced anomalous Hall effect and these new reflections We will first measure an FM single crystal of MnSb18Bi02Te4 at 3 K well below both identified ordering temperatures using the position sensitive detector PSD option on BT-7 Initial PND refinements suggest a propagation vector of either k  02505025 We have already investigated the HOL zone and have seen no non-Q  0 reflections so we will mount the crystal in the H H L zone and rotate it by 11 degrees about the 001 plane to allow us to probe the 025 05 025 propagation vector as a satellite of the 00L reflections Given the uncertain nature of the ordering we expect to need to measure a wide portion of reciprocal space necessitating the PSD From our previous measurements we expect to need 3 days of beam time for this survey Once we have identified the propagation vector of the new reflections we will measure all 4 cross-sections of polarized neutron diffraction for these peaks to confirm their magnetic nature and as a probe of whether there is any chirality induced that might explain the anomalous transport data We will also track the temperature evolution of the polarized scattering to deconvolve any possible structural contribution preliminary measurements suggest a possible change in structure concomitant with the appearance of this new propagation vector We expect to need another 3 days of polarized beam time to cover this This proposed research will be done in collaboration with Dr Julie Borchers Dr Patrick Quarterman Dr Colin Heikes Dr William Ratcliff at NIST Center for Neutron
