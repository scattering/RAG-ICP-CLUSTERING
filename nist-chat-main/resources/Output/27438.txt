Introduction and state of science Curved cell membranes are important for the function of the cell both for compartmentalization in organelles within the cell as well as for cellular mitosis It has also been shown that the curvature of a lipid membrane can affect the concentration of membrane bound proteins In this project we have used semiconductor nanowires in order to study the effect of curvature on phospholipid bilayers and membrane proteins Semiconductor nanowires are increasingly used in life science as nanometre probes and to manipulate living cells When interfacing high aspect ratio nanowires with cells the first point of contact is the cell membrane which forms a locally highly curved membrane around the nanowires  We have previously demonstrated the formation of a supported phospholipid bilayer on nano wires via vesicle fusion which can be used as a proxy to curved membranes Based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching FRAP measurement the phospholipid bilayers were found to follow the contours of the nano wires as continuous and fluid locally curved bilayers  However these data do not determine the coverage composition and the dimensions of the bilayer Previous experiments have aimed to reveal that using Grazing Incident SANS GISANS which have shown us the formation of a lipid bilayer and the subsequent binding of membrane protein These should now be complemented by reflection measurements Previous results We recently finished two GISANS experiments on phospholipid covered nanowires one at the VSANS beam line at NIST and on at the SANS2D beam line at ISIS In these two experiments we have used a lipid mixture consisting of DOPC with 20 DOPE covering Si nanowires in a single bilayer The GISANS experiments have shown that we can resolve the nanowires and the lipid bilayer We have also performed a preliminary reflectivity study on Offspec at ISIS where we could clearly see a difference between a flat Si surface and our nanowire surface Figure 1 shows reflectivity data from Offspec with and without the lipid cover nano-wire substrate in D2O and CMSi solvent The results from the fit to the experimental data are given in the Table inserted in the figure Pleas note that it was not possible to get a good fit without taking into account the presence of the nanowires Layer Thickness  SLD 10-6-2 Solvent content  Roughness Bare NW on substrate Oxide 10 347 0 4 NW 9083 233 854 22 Lipid -
