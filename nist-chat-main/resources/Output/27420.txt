Probing the link between the microstructural behavior and bulk response ofrod-like viruses at high shear rates via capillary rheo-SANSSteve Kuei Ryan Murphy Kathleen Weigandt Steven D HudsonIntroductionThe ow behavior and ow instabilities of complex uids in shear is a commonly studied phenomenon this isparticularly true of solutions of long laments due to their relevance in polymeric and worm-like micellar uidsHowever there is still a gap between our understanding of the bulk rheology and that of the microstructuraldetails of the solution In particular there is an ongoing e ort to understand the shear thinning behavior of suchsolutions and whether or not structural changes in the uid will lead to shear banding and other ow instabilitiesSuch instabilities have been observed in complex uid solutions spanning all manner of soft materials from rigid laments like actin 1 to semi exible entangled polymers 1 to materials with transitory brous structuressuch as the ever shifting branches of wormlike micelle surfactant solutions  There are a number of outstandingquestions regarding the origins of these ow instabilities for example it is unknown whether the phenomenonarises from mechanical hydrodynamic interactions thermodynamic e ects  or even both  and whether itchanges in di erent concentration regimes or ow planesThere are a host of parameters that can modify shear banding dynamics in complex uids but in order to decoupletheir e ects and make progress in the baseline theoretical descriptions we choose Fd-virus as a quasi-ideal modelsystem It has a length L  880 nm a thickness d  66 nm and a persistence length lp  22 m 12 1 asthe aspect ratio is Ld  133 and the persistence length is roughly 25 times the length Fd-virus is a remarkablythin sti  and monodisperse rod making for an excellent and well-studied model 4 7 9 1 In addition boththe e ective aspect ratio  and the exibility  of the virus can be tuned allowing for additional explorationTo capture the model uids dynamics and compare them to theoretical predictions we must be able to takerheological measurements of our model uid while also being able to visualize its microstructure We proposethe use of capillary rheo-SANS which addresses our rheological and structural characterization needs while alsobeing amenable to a variety of complementary visualization techniques including particle velocimetry for ow eld measurements As we push towards the regime of very high shear rates we wish to measure the functionaldependence of the rotational di usion coe cients and pair correlations between bers on shear rate exibilityand other factors with the ultimate aim of writing theoretical distribution functions that accurately capture andconnect microstructure and bulk propertiesTheoryAt rest rod-like uids have clear equilibrium phase transitions as a function of rod concentration However whensubjected to ow the rod orientations are a ected which leads to shifts in the transition area and introduces thepossibility of a mechanical origin of transition 3 5 1 These dynamical instabilities can lead to shear bandswhich has been observed in all manner of complex uids and while a great many models have been put forth to1Figure 1 1 Porod plot for Fd virus in Tris bu er at 11 mgmL The solid line is t to q 1 The inset is anazimuthal intensity pro le which is t to the Maier-Saupe ODFexplain the phenomenon Olmsted noted that a microscopic theoretical picture of shear banding was still lacking1 More recently as experimental techniques have gradually been able to capture more microstructural detailsattempts have been made to address this gap Lang et al 1 in particular compared two promising theoreticalcalculations for rigid rod uids and provided criticisms for further investigationThe rst the Smoluchowski theory is based o of an orientational distribution function ODF u t written foreach rod u It is a function of the rotational di usion coe cient at in nite dilution D0r 3kBT lnLd sL3 where L andd are the length and thickness of a rod and s is the solvent shear viscosity Assuming a pair correlation functionthat is independent of shear rate 1 uses this ODF to derive a relationship between the microscopic orientationalordering tensor and macroscopic measurables such as the zero-shear viscosity 0 The Doi-Edwards-Kuzuu DEKtheory in contrast uses a phenomenological function Dr in place of D0r  adding an orientation dependence to therotational di usion coe cient There are marked departures between the two and experimental data and theauthors note that both theories are missing critical information concerning high shear rates and ow eldsPrevious work and Present GoalsIn these previous work on lamentous virus systems scattering intensity pro les were captured by mounting astrain-controlled rheometer in a neutron beam at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland The pro les as inFig 1 can be t to a Maier-Saupe ODF f   I0 exp CP2 max  from which the full orientationaltensor can be calculated 1 and used in the above theoriesHere at NIST others in our group have demonstrated the feasability of performing capillary rheometry in aneutron beam on a system of worm-like micelles 1 with similar ability to capture scattering intensities In thisproject we would like to use a similar technique for the Fd system to achieve a more complete picture of rods inshear We have the capacity to stably access parameter ranges that were previously inaccessible using traditionalrheometers while simultaneously capturing ow elds and microstructural evolution and the ability to accurately2measure these two critical pieces of data opens the door to building and validating a true microscopic picture of ow instabilities in complex uidsSpeci cally we will measure rod interactions and ow dynamics by means of the orientational distribution functionas well as the orientational order parameter P2 and ordering tensor S we expect all of these to change as a functionof rod concentration and shear stress under ow conditionsExperimental planWe propose the study of Fd bacteriophage in Tris bu er at di erent concentrations near and below the isotropic-nematic transition at a range of shear rates at 25 C This totals 10 ow sweep experiments and controls Weanticipate each experiment taking approximately 8 hours of beam time to access a q-range of 0005 to 01 A 1As such we request a total of 5 days of beamtime to complete the experiment accounting for sample setupReferences Edward Barry Daniel Beller and Zvonimir Dogic A
