Magnetic Excitation in 1T-TaS2 I Introduction A prototypical quasi-2D metallic compound 1T-TaS2 has been extensively studied due to an intricate interplay between a Mott-insulating ground state and a charge density-wave CDW order The CDW phase is composed of molecular orbitals of 13 Ta atoms forming a hexagonal pattern of so-called David-star clusters Each Ta4 of 1T-TaS2 provides one 5d electron and thus there are 13 5d-electrons per each David star 12 out of these 13 electrons form 6 covalent bonds and leave one 5d-electron localized inside the David star 1 According to previous work 3 above 540K the 1T structure has P-3m1 symmetry When temperature goes down an incommensurate CDW phase sets in at T540K Upon further cooling the structure changes to a nearly commensurate phase at 350K Finally the material turns into a Mott insulating phase with in-plane 13  13 superlattice distortion which coexists with a commensurate CDW phase below 180K Superconductivity emerges in 1T-TaS2 below 2K with disorders  Recent specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements on 1T-TaS2  showed abnormal behaviors at low temperatures For susceptibility diamagnetic signal dominates the data from high temperatures down to 50K but the T curve exhibits a strong paramagnetic Curie-Weiss tail below 50K suggesting that short-range correlations might exist at low temperatures On the other hand the specific heat continues to decrease from high temperatures down to 50K and exhibits a sharp drop at 50K Upon further cooling it shows a slight increase below  1K indicating some residual entropy still remains at very low temperatures These experimental data suggest a quantum spin liquid state at low temperatures Thus searching and studying magnetic excitations at low temperature is needed to understand the low temperature phase II Proposed Research In the proposed research we would like to investigate the magnetic excitations of 1T-TaS2 under finite magnetic fields at low temperatures using the inelastic neutron scattering measurements on TaS2 single crystals We have measured the zero-field magnetic excitations of an aligned 1T-TaS2 single crystal sample which consist of 52 pieces of layered single crystals with a total mass of 083 g at the NCNR Multi-Angle Crystal Spectrometer MACS By measuring on the hk0 and h0l scattering plane at several different energies we have not observed any prominent magnetic excitation signal down to  17 K A previous heat capacity experiment on 1T-TaS2 under an external magnetic field showed some magnetic field induced anomaly at finite temperature  As is shown in Fig 1 the heat capacity C exhibits a bump for C  T below T2  25 K2 especially at H  3  5 T which is deviated away from the Debye model ie C  T  T2 This unusual bump in C  T may suggest the existence of the field-induced magnetic excitations for 1T-TaS2 Therefore we would like to perform further inelastic neutron scattering measurements at MACS under finite magnetic fields on the same 1T-TaS2 single crystal sample Fig 1 Heat capacity measurements of 1T-TaS2 at different magnetic fields plotted as C  T as a function of T2 The figure is obtained from Ref  We are going to perform neutron scattering experiments with magnetic field at MACS in late November to measure the field induced magnetic excitations of 1T- TaS2 on the hk0 plane For this proposal we would like to perform the same measurements on different scattering planes such as h0l and hhl planes For these measurements we request 5 days of MACS beamtime References  Rossnagel K  Smith N V Spin-orbit coupling in the band structure of reconstructed 1T-TaS2 Phys Rev B 73 073106 2006  Gan L-Y et al Strain tuning of the charge density wave in monolayer and bilayer 1T-TaS2 Phys Chem Chem Phys 18 3080-3085 2016  Wilson J A et al Charge-density waves and superlattices in the metallic layered transition metal dichalcogenides Adv Phys 24 117-201 1975  Spijkerman Aet al X-ray crystal-structure refinement of the nearly commensurate phase of 1T-TaS2 in 32-dimensional superspace Phys Rev B 56 13757-13767 1997  Xu P et al Superconducting phase in the layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 upon inhibition of the metal-insulator transition Phys Rev B 81 172503 2010  Marie Kratochvilova Adrian D Hillier The low-temperature highly correlated quantum phase in the charge-density-wave 1T-TaS2 compound npj Quantum Materials 2 Article number 42 2017  A Ribak et al Gapless excitations in the ground state of 1T-TaS2 Phys Rev B 96 195131 2017
