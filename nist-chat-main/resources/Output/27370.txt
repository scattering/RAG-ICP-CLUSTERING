Aims of the experiment and scientific background Self-assembled nanostructures based on peptide-polymer conjugates have become of increasing interest in recent years with promising applications in drug delivery1 Our work concerns cyclic octapeptides containing residues with alternating D- and L- stereochemistry which are capable of assembling into so-called nanotubes Self-assembly is mediated by hydrogen bonding between backbone amide bonds and hydrophobic - stacking interactions between peptide side chains2 These self-assembled cyclic peptide CP nanotubes can be further modified by the grafting of hydrophilic polymers resulting in water-soluble CP-polymer nanotubes CPNTs with additional functionalities imparted by polymer chains Our current work involves the use of CPNTs as drug delivery vectors where controlled length is required for optimum bioavailablity3 To date we have extensively characterised a range of CPNTs using SANS4-6 However due to the large size of these aggregates we are unable to resolve the Guinier region to determine the maximum length of CPNTs In order to design CPNTs with controlled length for optimum bioavailability an understanding of the influence of polymer properties on resultant CPNT length is required Here we plan on applying VSANS for the investigation of CPNT length and inter-nanotube interactions in order to gain insight into the structure of these supramolecular materials Proposed experiment In this study we propose to use SESANS to probe the real space density-density correlation function of CPNTs over long length scales For this purpose we propose to investigate four related materials shown in Figure 1 based on the cyclic octapeptide cycloL-Trp -D-Leu-L-TrpLys-D-Leu-L-Trp-D-Leu-L-Lys-D-Leu The first contain a cyclic peptide which is grafted to a poly2-ethyl-2-oxazoline pEtOX to form CP-pEtOX We hypothesise that steric hindrance of increased polymer lengths will act to control CPNT length We have therefore synthesised pEtOX polymers of three different lengths 50 100 and 200 repeating units and conjugated these to cyclic peptides to investigate the influence of polymer length on CPNT length Secondly we have recently synthesised and characterised kinetically trapped nanotubes These contain a cyclic peptide grafted to a diblock copolymer containing a polybutyl acrylate pBA hydrophobic block and a hydrophilic polydimethyl acrylamide pDMA hydrophilic block We hypothesise that the inclusion of a hydrophobic block stabilises nanotubes via the hydrophobic effect leading to increased CPNT length We have therefore synthesised three polymers where the ratio of pBA and pDMA block lengths is changed to investigate the influence of polymer hydrophobicity on CPNT length Finally we propose to investigate so-called Janus CPNTs where two polymers are grafted to the peptide one hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic7 This leads to secondary self-assembly of CPNTs into the tubisome where hydrophobic polymers pack into a core and hydrophilic polymers extend towards aqueous solvent in a hydrated shell6 We have synthesised two variants of this tubisome-forming conjugate one with polybutyl acrylate and another with polystyrene pS as the hydrophobic core both with polyPEG acrylate pPEGA hydrophilic polymers We hypothesise that additional - stacking present in pS-containing samples not present in pBA-containing samples will stabilise the hydrophobic tubisome core leading to increased length VSANS will provide information on the maximum dimensions of CPNTs allowing us to determine the influence of polymer properties on CPNT lengths Sample Preparation Cyclic peptides have been synthesised as side-chain protected linear peptides using solid-phase peptide synthesis These linear peptides are then cyclised and deprotected prior to polymer conjugation Polymers have been synthesised via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer RAFT conjugated to cyclic peptides purified and lyophilised These compounds have all been synthesised and will be transported to NIST in powder form CP-polymer powders prepared in D2O at three concentrations 5 mgmL 2 mgmL and 1 mgmL Figure 1 Chemical structures of CP-polymer conjugates proposed to be investigated in this study Data collection and analysis Data will be collected using VSANS using a convergent white beam Samples will be loaded into large diameter 2mm path length rectangular quartz cuvettes in order to maximise neutron flux on the sample and mounted in a sample changer maintained at 25C VSANS profiles of compounds will be collected for 30-90 minutes depending on the strength of scattering observed VSANS data will be analysed by assuming a core-shell cylindrical form factor implemented within SasView Summary of sample characterisation and results from related beam time Our preliminary studies have structurally characterised the CPNTs proposed to be investigated in this study using SANS data collected at 1 mgmL concentration using Larmor ISIS Figure 2 Initial fits to thee data were achieved using a cylindrical micelle model for CP-pEtOX and CP-pBA-b-pDMA and using a guinier-porod model for pBA-CP-pPEGA and pS-CP-pPEGA In all cases good fits were obtained to the data with parameters consistent with elongated cylindrical structures As is evident from the SANS data the size of all of the structures measured is large enough that the Guinier region is not observed in the q range obtainable with conventional SANS Therefore the only information we have on the length of these CPNTs is that they are  100 nm These data demonstrate that the CPNTs proposed to be studied are of a suitable size for measurement by VSANS Justification for beam time request We plan on measuring the VSANS profile of each compound for 30-90 minutes as required depending on the strength of signal observed We plan on collecting VSANS data of 8 materials CP-pEtOX of three chain lengths CP-pBA-b-pDMA of three ratios pBA-CP-pPEGA and pS-CP-pPEGA In order to investigate concentration dependence on CPNT length we will measure each of these materials at three concentrations resulting in 24 measurements This accounts for 36 hours of measurement time Taking into account direct beam measurements background measurements and sample changes we therefore request 2 days of beamtime on VSANS Our preliminary data indicate that CP-polymer conjugates assume a cylindrical structure as expected While we have collected SANS data providing information on the overall morphology of the self-assembled structures we do not have any precise information regarding their absolute length VSANS is essential to obtain this information allowing the design of supramolecular materials of controlled length with applications as drug-delivery vectors Alternative techniques such as SAXS suffers from the same q-range limitation as solution SANS but with decreased contrast While TEM can provide information on the overall size of the particles it does not provide a realistic snapshot of CPNTs in solution requiring either staining with heavy atoms or imaging under cryogenic conditions Therefore we believe VSANS to be ideal providing high neutron flux crucially a wide accessible q-range required to define the absolute dimensions of CPNTs References 1 Chapman R et al Chem Soc Rev 41 6023-6041 2012 2 Ghadiri M R et al Nature 366 324 1993 3 Larnaudie S C et al Biomacromolecules 19 239-247 2018 4 Larnaudie S C et al ACS Macro Lett 6 1347-1351 2017 5 Mansfield E D H et al Soft Matter 14 6320-6326 2018 6 Brendel J C et al Angew Chem 130 16920-16924 2018 7 Danial M et al Nat Commun 4 2780 2013 8 Andersson R et al J Appl Crystallogr 41 868-885 2008 Figure 2 Solution SANS data points with associated fits solid lines corresponding to CPNTs in D2O
