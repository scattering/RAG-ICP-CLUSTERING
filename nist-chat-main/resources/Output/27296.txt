Membrane interactions of herpesvirus nuclear egress complex Background Viruses can only replicate in cells but due to the compartmentalization of animal cells viruses have had to become experts at getting across membranes One of the most unusual ways to get across membranes is found in herpesviruses Herpesviruses infect the majority of the worlds population for life typically alternating between a dormant state and reactivation that causes symptoms ranging from cold sores to life-threatening conditions in people with immature or compromised immune systems During replication new viral capsids are assembled in the nucleus and must escape from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where they mature into infectious virions Most traffic in and out of the nucleus occurs through the 50-nm nuclear pores but 125-nm herpesviral capsids cannot fit through them Instead they use an unusual process where capsids dock at the inner nuclear membrane INM and bud into the perinuclear space forming enveloped virions that subsequently fuse with the outer nuclear membrane 1  This process unique among known vertebrate viruses allows the capsids to escape from the nucleus into the cytoplasm The virally encoded nuclear egress complex NEC a heterodimer of UL31 and UL34 is the key player in this process 1  Previously we showed the NEC alone can mediate membrane budding and scission in the absence of any factors which we demonstrated by reconstituting the budding process in vitro using purified recombinant NEC from Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 HSV-1 and synthetic lipid membranes Fig 1A  This finding established the NEC is a self-contained virally encoded membrane budding nanomachine We also solved the crystal structure of the HSV-1 NEC  UL34 forms a globular pedestal whereas UL31 has a globular domain positioned on top of the UL34 pedestal and a hook-like extension that wraps around UL34 Fig 1C We refer to the crystallized construct as the NEC core The unstructured N terminus of UL31 1-50 and C terminus of UL34 186-246 absent from the structures are sandwiched between the crystallized core of the NEC heterodimer and the membrane 3- We refer to them as membrane-proximal regions MPRs Fig 1C The MPRs mediate membrane interactions and are essential for budding data not shown We hypothesize that the MPRs modify the membrane bilayer to generate negative membrane curvature a prerequisite for budding We further showed that the NEC oligomerized into hexagonal coats on the budded membranes formed in vitro Fig 1B as well as in vivo as shown by others  and formed a hexagonal lattice of similar dimensions in the HSV-1 NEC crystals Fig 1D  NEC oligomerization into hexagonal coats is clearly required for budding because mutations disrupting oligomeric interfaces block budding both in vivo and in vitro Fig 1D 3 4  We hypothesize that the NEC lattice functions as a scaffold for the budding vesicles Fig 1 A In-vitro budding assay Purified NEC and vesicles are co-incubated with membrane-impermeable dye Cascade blue As the result of budding lipid vesicles contain intraluminal vesicles filled with blue dye B A diagram of NEC constructs Stars indicate

coats on the inner surface of budded vesicles cryoEM and ET E The NEC crystal lattice has the same dimensions as the NEC coat in budded vesicles Locations of the DN yellow star and SUP orange star mutations are indicated Goals Collectively these observations suggest that the NECmembrane interactions and the oligomerization of the NEC into a hexagonal lattice are two major forces that drive budding But we do not yet understand how NEC interacts with membranes or the relationship between NECmembrane interactions and the formation of the NEC lattice Therefore our first goal is to determine how the NECs interacts with the membrane by asking To what extent the MPRs penetrate the membrane bilayer How is the NEC oriented relative to the membrane bilayer Does the NEC change the bilayer properties Our second goal is to characterize the relationship between membrane interactions and NEC lattice formation by comparing membrane interactions of the wild-type WT NEC a non-budding mutant containing mutations at the lattice interfaces NEC-DN and the suppressor mutant that rescues budding NEC-DNSUP Preliminary Data In our previous experiments at NCNR we used neutron reflectometry to characterize membrane interactions of the NEC the non-budding NEC-DN mutant and the rescue NEC-DNSUP mutant Neutron reflectometry NR can visualize proteinmembrane interactions under fully hydrated native conditions and by achieving contrast between the lipid and the protein through the use of H2O and D2O based solvents Moreover given neutron sensitivity to the depth profile NR provides not only the penetration depth of the protein but also any membrane remodeling accompanying it such as changes in membrane thickness upon protein binding For these studies we used the well-established tethered lipid bilayer membrane tBLM platform that enables studying interactions between biomimetic membranes and other macromolecules in vitro  This platform consists of a lipid membrane deposited on a gold surface capped with a partial lipid leaflet that serves as both anchor and template for the completed membrane the HC18-tethered bilayers or HC18-tBLM We found that the WT NEC adopted multiple orientations with a broad range of tilt angles from the vertical position and penetrated into the polar headgroup layer with no effect on membrane thickness Fig 2A The NEC-DN mutant was also tilted but had a much broader range of possible orientations Surprisingly the NEC-DN mutant inserted deeper into the bilayer than the WT NEC and caused significant thinning of the bilayer Fig 2A The rescue NEC-DNSUP mutant predicted to behave like WT NEC did not bind the bilayer well even at 5x concentration of NEC and NEC-DN Fig 2A This was unexpected because the single rescuing mutation is not located in the MPRs Fig 1C and thus should not influence membrane interactions at least not directly A second experiment with a different batch of NEC-DNSUP yielded a similar density profile outside the membrane but a different density profile on the membrane compared to the first experiment Fig 2B These observations suggest that in the tBLM system WT NEC adopts multiple states on the bilayer ranging from oligomerized and thus more rigid in orientation to monomeric more flexible in orientation The NEC-DN mutant being deficient in oligomerization is mostly monomeric and is thus free to adopt a broader range of orientations on the bilayer The monomeric NEC-DN mutant inserts between the lipid headgroups forcing them apart On a free bilayer this would create positive curvature but on a supported bilayer spreading out of the headgroups instead increases the area per lipid which thins the membrane We hypothesize that interactions between WT NEC lacking in the NEC-DN mutant somehow counteract the membrane-disrupting characteristics of the individual NEC molecules ultimately generating the negative membrane curvature Fig 2 Preliminary NR data Protein density profiles are referenced to the outer headgroup so changes in membrane thickness are not shown A Comparison of WT NEC green NEC-DN black and NEC-DNSUP gray on HC18-tBLM NEC-DN is 10  closer to the membrane than NEC220 with significant protein density in the outer headgroup region NEC-DNSUP has lower binding affinity to HC18-tBLM B Comparison of NEC-DNSUP from June 2018 black and August 2019 green We now wish to measure the effect of SUP mutation on membrane interactions which is necessary for elucidating the mechanism by which this mutation rescues budding in the non-budding NEC-DN mutant The decrease in membrane binding observed for the NEC-DNSUP mutant suggests that the SUP mutation somehow alters the ability of NEC to interact with the bilayer despite being located far away from the membrane interface We now ask is the decrease in membrane binding due to the SUP mutation itself or the combined effect of DN and SUP mutations To answer this question and to derive more accurate models we need to obtain an additional data set for NEC-SUP and to re-measure the NEC-DN and the NEC-DNSUP which we will compare to the available data for the WT NEC the NEC-DN and the NEC-DNSUP Upon successful completion of the proposed studies we will elucidate not only the nature of membrane interactions by the NEC but also the relationship between membrane interactions and lattice formation two forces that drive NEC-mediated budding The new NR data will allow us to finalize a manuscript on NECmembrane interactions that is currently in preparation More broadly the results will be an important step
