SANS and USANS study to understand crystallization-driven self-assembly of anisotropicparticles from diblock copolymersAvanish Bharati Steven D Hudson Katie M WeigandtBackground The self-assembly of anisotropic particles in nature  has inspired us to mimicthat process via synthetic toolboxes for various applications The major impediment in univer-sally employing that route lies in preparing narrow poly-dispersed and stable particles with tunablesize and shape The commonly researched narrow poly-dispersed biological particles such as bac-teria and viruses and organicinorganic particles entail elaborate synthesis with access to a limitedrange of aspect ratio ratio of length to diameter and flexibility ratio of persistence length todiameter Moreover the well-studied worm-like micelles have dynamic structures at various hi-erarchical length scales resulting in short time-scale dynamics and altering morphology In thisproposal we aim to develop and characterize narrow poly-dispersed anisotropic particles with awide range of aspect ratio by crystallization-driven self-assembly CDSA  of poly-L-lactic acidPLLApolyethylene oxide PEO diblockb copolymers The overall objective of the proposalis to leverage the groups research expertise for answering the fundamental questions relevant tothe flow behavior of soft materials under industrially-relevant shear rates using capillary rheometrycombined with neutron scattering Particularly the flow behavior will be simulated and the corre-sponding predictions of the small-angle scattering SAS pattern of particles with a wide range ofaspect ratio will be compared to the experimental SAS pattern for a broad range of Peclet numberThe study will provide the framework to verify molecular theories of colloids like Doi-Edwards-Hess theory in non-linear non-simple flow conditionsMechanism of CDSA Tremendous success in using CDSA process  to develop particles withtunable shape  as well as hierarchical structures has been achieved However a fundamentalunderstanding of the effects of material parameters such as di-blocks molecular weights Mw andtheir ratio as well as thermodynamic conditions namely the driving force for crystallization andsolvent quality on the final size and shape of the particles is still elusive We will attempt to answerthose lingering questions in this work starting with elucidating the mechanism of CDSA followedby an overview of the effects of di-blocks physical characteristics and thermodynamic conditionson the final shape of particles Adjusting the solvent quality from a good solvent acetone forboth blocks to a solvent D2O selective for PEO the solution was held at a temperature belowthe crystallization temperature of PLLA so that PLLA crystallized Crystallization under theseconditions resulted in poly-disperse particles of PLLA core surrounded by an amorphous PEOcorona attributed as pre-seeds The poly-disperse particles were subjected to probe sonication togenerate shorter narrow poly-dispersed particles referred to as seeds Altering the solvent qualityand varying the length of the PEO to PLLA blocks for different length of the PLLA block allowedtuning the shape of the seeds We hypothesize that altering the material parameters and crystal-lization conditions will alter the final size of the particles This proposal also aims at optimizingthe solvent quality and crystallization temperature to develop narrow poly-dispersed rod-like par-ticles with a wide range of aspect ratio The essential idea is a spatially homogeneous growth ofthe PLLA block from the solution onto its 1-dimensional 1D crystal growth front in the seedswould render long rods depending on the block concentration We hypothesize that such rod-likeparticles of narrow poly-dispersity and with controlled aspect ratio can be generated by alteringthe temperature and solvent quality1Preliminary results and proposed measurements We recently conducted experiments to assessthe feasibility of studying CDSA with wide-angle X-ray scattering WAXS small-angle neutronscattering SANS and dynamic light scattering DLS The homogeneity of deuterated d-acetoneand D2O mixtures was ascertained for various compositions and at different temperatures usingDLS and SANS WAXS measurements on seeds in d-acetoneD2O mixture revealed a sharp crys-talline peak at 2  165 data not shown consistent with the orthorhombic unit cell of PLLA Theestimated d-spacing of 537 A indicated chain folding occurred at lamellar surfaces of single crys-tals For promoting the formation of rod-like seeds the self-assembly of nuclei during nucleationshould favor the formation of 1D nuclei for which the hydrophobic crystallizing core for linearpolymers without aromatic rings is preferably between 30 to 50 along with a minimum degree ofpolymerization to induce crystallization On that premise we appropriately choose PLLA-b-PEOcopolymers of various Mw block ratios for a fixed Mw of PLLA 2 Kgmol as well as diblockswith similar Mw block ratios for a shorter PLLA 1 KgmolSANS measurements were performed on the pre-seeds and corresponding seeds after ensuring thereproducible size distribution of the seeds using DLS The effects of the crystallization temperatureand solvent quality on the shape of the particles were investigated to obtain non-aggregated seedsof various shapes Using the optimal growth conditions 10 vol d-acetone in D2O at 55 C andsonication conditions the influence of blocks Mw ratio on the shape of the seeds for a fixed PLLA2 Kgmol was investigated using SANS as shown in Figure 1a The high-q Porod slope of -4and an intermediate-q Guinier slope of -1 indicate the formation of the desired 1D particles for220 PLLA-b-PEO with 2 Kgmol PLLA in Figure 1b In contrast for a similar Porod slope anintermediate-q slope of -2 suggests the formation of larger 2D sheet-like structures for less asym-metric di-blocks in Figure 1a The 1D SANS plot for the pre-seeds seeds and CDSA structuresunder optimal seeding conditions and similar CDSA conditions for the suitable 220 di-blocks with2Kgmol PLLA is exhibited in Figure 1b There is a size reduction of the poly-dispersed pre-seedsupon probe sonication to result in seeds with a narrow poly-dispersity Form-factor fitting usingan elliptical cylinder model of the SANS spectrum for the seeds and CDSA shown as lines indi-cates their 1D cylindrical shape Further lower q measurements with USANS for pre-seeds longerseeds and CDSA structures are required to estimate the particles dimensions for a comprehensiveunderstanding of the self-assembly parameter space This study will shed light on the effects ofgrowth conditions and blocks physical characteristics on the dimensions of pre-seeds and seedsto develop predictive equations relating packing parameter of nuclei and particles dimensionsMoreover the USANS measurements will allow to optimize the solvent quality and temperaturefor the CDSA process to develop rod-like particles with narrow poly-dispersity for a broad rangeof aspect ratio Approach would be to optimize the solvent ratio to be good for the PEO coronaand marginal to bad for the PLLA core for minimizing the core-corona entropic repulsion Further-more a temperature higher than the crystallization temperature of PLLA will be chosen to mitigateits propensity to self-nucleate and to develop CDSA particles with a narrow poly-dispersity Wewill verify our approaches using USANS measurements with the aim to generate narrow poly-dispersed 1D particles with controlled aspect ratio depending on the di-block concentrationDesign of experiments For this study we start with 1D seeds and propose to vary the solventquality 5 10 and 20 vol d-acetone in D2O CDSA growth temperature 0 25 and 75 C andseed
