Cooperative effect of hyperbranched and dendritic nitrogen-rich microgel precursors in mixed-matrix polymer-polymer membranes Rachel R Ford Orland Bateman Mamadou S Diallo and Julia A Kornfield Background Polymer membranes are increasingly important in energy generation water purification and resource recovery Control over chemistry morphology and mechanical properties offered by organic polymers confers a unique set of advantages for membrane technology Important advances by Diallo and coworkers1-4 in the field of mixed matrix membranes combine the durability of polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF membranes with the fouling resistance and diverse functionality of neutral hydrophilic polymers The Diallo Group recently developed a one-pot method to prepare PVDF membranes with stably embedded polymeric particles Figure 1 which we term mixed-matrix polymer-polymer M2P2 membranes The fouling resistance stability and facile functionalization of M2P2 membranes have been well documented1-4 Essential to M2P2 membranes is the in-situ crosslinking of a nitrogen-rich polymer in the membrane casting solution to form microgel particles anchored in a PVDF matrix A particularly interesting set of cost-effective scalable nitrogenous polymers includes low-generation polyamidoamine dendrimers PAMAM and hyperbranched polyethyleneimine PEI resultant membrane cross sections from PAMAM- and PEI-based particles in the dry state are shown in Figure 1 A  B respectively Clearly the architecture of the microgel precursor dendrimer vs hyperbranched profoundly affects the size and number density of functional polymer particles despite being prepared under analogous conditions We hypothesize that the two main factors responsible for the more compact PEI particles are i the uniform architecture of PAMAM in contrast to PEI and ii the uniform reaction site at the terminal primary amines of PAMAM in contrast to the combination of secondary and primary amines of PEI To test our hypotheses regarding the roles of polymer chemistry and architecture in membrane morphology we need to characterize crosslinking kinetics and microstructure formation during membrane synthesisand USANS is uniquely capable of providing this information due to the optical opacity and lack of x-ray scattering contrast in the reaction mixture To study structure formation in M2P2 membrane casting solutions we developed transient USANS methods and discovered that the different Figure 1 Scanning electron micrographs of M2P2 membrane cross sections A Large diffuse PAMAM particles in a sponge-like PVDF matrix B Smaller compact PEI particles with smaller domains of PVDF threading through Note Under hydrated conditions we expect that particles swell to occupy all vacant space morphologies Figure 1 correlate with differences in structure development in the reaction mixture To test our understanding of the molecular basis of the difference we have designed experiments in which both PAMAM and PEI particle precursors are present in the reaction mixture Preparation of M2P2 membranes begins with a solution of PVDF in a good solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone NMP at 80C to which an amine oligomer is addedhyperbranched PEI or low-generation PAMAM Next a crosslinker epichlorohydrin ECH is added to the dispersion to covalently link precursors into nitrogen-rich microgel particles in-situ in the casting solution creating a structure that is inaccessible by simply mixing PVDF with the incompatible nitrogen-rich polymer particles The dispersion is then cast onto a support and immersed in water initiating non-solvent induced phase separation NIPS and producing the gradient morphology that is essential in the solid membrane Preliminary Results Traditionally USANS requires much longer acquisition times than SANS due to significantly lower flux of neutrons in the former USANS requires hours SANS requires minutes However USANS data obtained using the recommended acquisition time 27 hours on a fully reacted casting solution with PEI revealed very high signal-to-noise With this realization we modified the acquisition parameters and slowed down the crosslinking reaction to preserve the general features of the reaction while enabling acquisition of time-resolved data These modifications allowed us to observe structure development in membrane casting solutions while particles were forming using USANS with an acquisition time of ten minutes Figure 2 cycling through a set of samples returning to a given casting solution every 30-45 minutes Figure 2 Results from prior USANS beam

precursor Figure 2A early scattering profiles suggest structure formation is driven initially by the increase in the molecular weight of the PEI as the small 06 kgmol oligomers link to form higher molecular weight hyperbranched polymers during the first 4 hrs Thereafter the scattering profile does not change appreciably in shape but increases in intensity This suggests that formation of large PEI microgels acts to quench the system into the spinodal regime the magnitude of composition variations increases while the length scale of segregation of PEI and PVDF remains relatively constant A manuscript is being prepared describing the results from casting solutions containing PEI When PAMAM-G0 is the nitrogen-rich precursor Figure 2B the structure develops by macroscopic phase separation In a casting solution containing 4 PAMAM-G0 Fig 2B the latent period during which no structure has formed in the USANS lengthscale exceeds ten hours followed by a modest growth in intensity that drifts to larger lengthscales than USANS probes This agrees with SEM images showing much larger more diffuse PAMAM particles compared to PEI Fig 1 We hypothesized that the incipient PAMAM-microgels allow PVDF to diffuse through them In turn we hypothesized that a relatively small fraction of PEI might yield PAMAM-PEI microgels that avoid macrophase separation Indeed replacing just a quarter of the PAMAM with PEI causes drastically different features to emerge Fig 2C Despite PEI being the minority nitrogen-containing constituent the solution exhibits behavior much more like that of PEI alone 2A than of PAMAM alone 2B For functional membranes the more finely distributed microgels are desired and the combination of amide and amine groups provided by PAMAM enable selective metal binding motivating further investigation of the effect of PEI on morphology development in a PAMAM-precursor casting solution Proposed Experiments Preliminary data have indicated that the combination of PAMAM-G0 and a small amount of PEI in casting solutions leads to unusual structure formation an effect we want to explore further To this end we will use hydrogenous and deuterated N-methylpyrrolidone at an isotope ratio corresponding to the contrast match condition for deuterated PAMAM 24H76D to prepare a series of casting solutions with varied ratios of PAMAM to PEI while keeping the total nitrogen-rich polymer constant at 4 by weight We will prepare samples of casting solution at three different ratios of PAMAM to PEI with matched pairs of hydrogenous and deuterated PAMAM Additionally we will study two generations of PAMAM G0 and G1 for a total of twelve samples We will use a banjo cell with a 2 mm path length and 05 mL capacity Having demonstrated that acquisition times on the order of ten minutes provide adequate SN USANS we propose to examine twelve samples over the course of reaction for 12 hours in sets of two alternating acquisition totaling 72 hours We therefore request three days of time on the BT-5 USANS instrument References 1 Kotte M R Cho M and Diallo M S J Memb Sci 2014 450 93-102 2 Kotte M R Hwang T Han J-I and Diallo M S J Memb Sci 2015 474 277-287 3
