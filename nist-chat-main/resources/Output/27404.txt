 1 Reorientational dynamics in a series of magnesium borohydride ammonia inclusion compounds 1 Scientific background In recent years numerous and diverse borohydrides have been discovered including mixed anion compounds where BH4- is substituted by a halide or NH2- amide anions inclusion compounds where neutral H-rich molecules such as NH3 are incorporated in metal borohydride crystal structures and metal boranes where large closo BnHn2- n  10 12 units represent the anionic species 1 At the same time it became apparent that borohydrides possess interesting properties beyond hydrogen storage which has given rise to expectations that these systems can be tailored toward novel functional materials  Ammine metal borohydrides MBH4m  nNH3 have received significant attention owing to the favorable dihydrogen interaction between partly positively charged hydrogen H bonded to N and partly negatively charged hydrogen H bonded to B which may result in a lower temperature for elimination of hydrogen molecules Metal borohydride inclusion compounds also offer other interesting fundamental questions such as quantum mechanical rotational tunneling in YBH43nNH3 and PrBH43nNH3 adducts As mentioned above these compounds are also potential candidates for hydrogen storage In the case of MgBH42 the kinetics and the high decomposition temperature pose issues However it has been shown that these issues can be tackled by including ligand molecules such as terahydrofuran THF C4H8O MgBH42nTHF adducts exhibit both a lower melting point and faster decomposition kinetics Recent quasielastic neutron scattering QENS measurements conducted on MgBH42nTHF adducts at the NCNR on both HFBS and DCS have indeed successfully correlated the observed THF reorientational mobility to the strength of Mg2-THF bonding interactions  It is therefore of great interest to study other potentially promising adducts such as MgBH42nNH3 which incorporate ammonia NH3 ligands 2 This proposal The proposed experiment at NCNR aims at the characterization of the dynamical properties of MgBH42nNH3 n  0 1 3 and 6 adducts via QENS measurements In particular the objective is to determine the mechanistic aspects ie spatial geometry time-scale activation energy of the reorientational dynamics of the BH4- anion and NH3 molecular moieties as functions of n MgBH42nNH3 are known to form ionic complexes for n  6 while molecular structures are obtained for n  3 Fig 1 b and chain-like structures for n  1 Fig 1 a Generally NH3 ligands coordinate more strongly than BH4- complex anions On the other hand BH4- has a more flexible coordination to the metal cation acting either as a terminal or bridging ligand or as a counter ion  Fig 1 Crystal structures of a MgBH42  NH3 and b MgBH42  3NH3 2 With this study we hope to increase our understanding of dihydrogen bonding in boron-nitrogen based hydrides Besides being of considerable fundamental interest this new knowledge is expected to be useful for the development of new highly efficient hydrogen-storage materials based on metal hydrides Moreover based on some preliminary QENS measurements on the related YBH43nNH3 adducts we also anticipate the fundamentally intriguing occurrence of observable low-temperature NH3 quantum rotational tunneling In the following subsections a more detailed description is given regarding the proposed measurements and the samples a Measurements We would like to compare Mg11BH42 with 3 different Mg11BH42nNH3 adducts and 3 different selectively deuterated Mg11BH42nND3 adducts corresponding to n1 3 and 6 The latter 3 selectively deuterated adducts are intended to help distinguish the potentially overlapping reorientational dynamics of BH4- and NH3 moeities during data analysis For each sample on HFBS we will first collect an elastic fixed window scan FWS starting from base temperature 4 K to 300 K This will provide information regarding which temperature regions are suitable for detailed QENS studies as well as how the dynamics change as a function of temperature The FWS will be followed by QENS measurements for 5 selected temperatures plus base temperature to allow for a detailed study of the slower dynamics and determination of the activation energy To access the faster dynamics as well as a larger Q range the HFBS measurements will be followed by QENS measurements on DCS for 5 temperatures plus base temperature The larger Q range of DCS is crucial for the analysis of the QENS data in terms of reorientational dynamics The measuring time for each sample on HFBS is estimated to be 4 h per QENS spectrum 5 temperatures  8 h for the FWS Thus we estimate a need of 28 hsample 548 for a total of 196 h for the 4 protonated samples and 3 selectively deuterated samples Adding time for temperature equilibration and sample changes we ask for 9 days on HFBS On DCS we estimate the need for 24 hsample 64 ie a total of 96 h 4 days for the protonated samples and an additional 3 days for the selectively deuterated samples Accounting for sample changes and time for temperature stabilization we ask for 8 days on DCS b Samples  safety related issues About 05 g of each sample will be prepared by the Jensen group at Aarhus University The samples will be synthesized using 11B to minimize the absorption of neutrons All samples are stable at room temperature in inert atmosphere and should be stored in a glove box upon arrival to NCNR to decrease the risk of sample degradation If the samples are heated above their decomposition temperature they release H2 and NH3 which could pose a fireexplosion and toxic hazard The measurements will be conducted below the decomposition temperature so the risk for H2 and NH3 release is small After the measurement the samples should be stored in inert atmosphere until they can be shipped back 3 References  M Paskevicius et al Metal borohydrides and derivatives - synthesis structure and properties Chem Soc Rev 2017 46 1565-1634  B R S
