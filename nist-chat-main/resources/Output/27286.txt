SANS study on the flow behavior of model bimodal polystyrene blends in solutionAvanish Bharati Steven D Hudson Katie M WeigandtBackground Industrial polymers have a large distribution of molecular weights Mw  2in which the complex interplay of Mw Mws distribution and concentration determines the dy-namics and the flow-behavior during processing and applications Furthermore non-linear non-simple flow fields are frequently encountered during polymer processing operations such as inblow molding film blowing and foaming The optimization of such operations demands a fun-damental insight into the in-situ rheological behavior and the concomitant micro-structure In thisperspective model bi-disperse blends comprising of two mono-disperse components of differentMw have proven a model system for the more complex and ubiquitous poly-disperse polymers00101110 Iq cm-14 5 6 70012 3 4 5 6 7012 3 4 5 q -1 -1-2 1 wt h-low at 15C in contrast-matched solvent cms 1 wt h-low  10 wt d-high at 15C in cms

depends on thecomplex interactions between long and shortchains Conflicting theories and experimen-tal findings have been discussed in the liter-ature in which the observed phenomenon iscontingent on the physical characteristics ofthe polymers the nature of polymer interac-tions flow-type and the associated deforma-tion and deformation-rates1 2  The keyto getting insights into the microstructure andinteractions of the chains during flow requiresin-situ time-resolved small-angle neutron scat-tering SANS measurements on model bi-disperse blends undergoing deformations un-der controlled flow conditions that are indus-trially and technologically relevant Recent in-situ time-resolved SANS measurements quali-tatively revealed that both the Mw of the long-chain and the blended short chains altered theinitial chain stretch and relaxation of the longchains during the uniaxial extension of bi-disperse polystyrene PS melts A caveatlies in the lack of information about the alteredconfiguration of the long chains or the blended short chains to pinpoint the nature of interactionsand phenomenology under a particular deformation and flow-type Our recent SANS studies onbi-disperse PS polymers in solution revealed thermodynamically driven alteration of single-chainconfiguration of shorter PS chains in the presence of longer PS chains under quiescent conditionsas shown in Figure 1 The experimental methodology and the findings have laid the groundworkto in-situ investigate flow-induced structural changes in similar model systemsOur contribution We hypothesize that the Mw-dependent interaction of the polymer chainswill determine the resulting flow-induced structural changes and the macroscopic rheological1behavior We aim to correlate the applied stress and the flow-induced alignment of both thelong and short chains in the semi-dilute state from the perspective of single-chain conforma-tionconfiguration during steady state shear flow of bi-disperse PS blends The proposed study willprovide the first experimental findings using the combination of capillary rheometry and SANS toverify phenomenological models for predicting the microstructure evolution under certain appliedstress or non-linear deformation on industrial polymers at length scales of single-chain conforma-tionconfigurationWe hypothesize that by leveraging the Mw and concentration-dependent interactions betweenlong and short PS chains we can tune the flow-induced molecular alignment as well as the overallmiscibility corresponding to a certain applied stress Providing fundamental insights into the steadystate evolution of the molecular and overall state of the system will provide a heuristic approach totailor micro-structure evolution down to length scales of single-chain conformationconfigurationThe steady state study of polymer-polymer interactions will allow ascertaining the nature of inter-actions between the lowhigh Mw PS chains Particularly the disputed flow-induced miscibilityor immiscibility will be resolved from the framework of nematic or frictional or excluded volumeor stress or concentration fluctuation contributions The findings will shed light on how confor-mationalconfigurational entropy contribution of the polymer as well as enthalpic contributions ofpolymer-solvent affect the overall miscibility which is still unresolved under flow conditionsMethodology We choose the Mw of PS to be 106 gmmol and 104 gmmol for both hy-drogenated h PS and deuterated d counterparts such that we can experimentally access varioustime-scales higher smaller and in between the Rouse and Reptation relaxation times of the shortand long chains respectively We propose choosing xylene as the solvent which is a theta solventfor PS at room temperature By performing offline linear viscoelastic measurements and estimat-ing the stress relaxation modulus using the Rouse or Reptation model we will calculate the rangeof accessible Weissenberg number Wi typically from 01 to 30 and the relevant shear rates typi-cally from 10 2 to 105 s 1 We will perform SANS to experimentally estimate the scatteringlength density sld of the various deuterated homopolymers and verify the absence of their coher-ent scattering in hd mixtures of xylene with an identical sld Following that we will alternativelychoose hd mixtures of lowhigh Mw PS with contrast matched d-PS to exclusively probe the hy-drogenated PS in the blend in the semi-dilute concentration limit refer to Table 1 This approachis expected to quantify the flow-induced changes in the form factor and polymer miscibility of thelow Mw PS chains in the vicinity of high Mw PS and vice-versa in the less-accessible semi-diluteconcentration limitFrom the q-dependence of the coherent scattering intensities we will estimate the single-chainstructure factor Sq using the Zimm approximations Using this approach we will extractthe radius of gyration of the chains second virial coefficients and the Kuhn length of the low MwPS in the vicinity of high Mw PS chains underflow The extracted length scales are expected tobe of the order of 1 to 20 nm Concentration effects will be quantified by studying the transitionfrom random walk to excluded volume statistics using the Kratky plots The second momentof the orientation distribution function will provide information on the orientation of the low Mwchains in the vicinity of the high Mw chains on the monomeric scale during steady-state flow andflow-cessation Alignment and chain relaxations in the blend will be measured at time scales ofthe order of the Rouse time of low Mw chain in between the Rouse time of low Mw chain andReptation time of high Mw chain as well as at time scales of the order of the Reptation time ofhigh Mw chain This will give fundamental insights into the in-situ orientational coupling of the2Table 1 Summary of blends prepared in contrast-matched solvents of dh xyleneWt of lowhigh Mw Type of

VSANS data with the high-resolution detector will beattained in a time-resolved mode using the time stamping technique Measurements will beperformed over a broad q-range from 0004 to 04 A 1 using standard configurations In total wehave 4 blends in contrast-matched solvents Table 1 Experiments will be performed at the steadystate We plan measuring one blend per day with up to 6 shear rates in different flow-regimesassuming a 4 hour measurement time with white beam Additional time is required to configurethe VSANS instrument and the capillary rheoSANS and to measure the scattering without thesample Hence we request for four days of beam time on VSANS to complete the proposed workReferences Yangyang Wang et al In Physical Review Letters 9923 2007 p 237801 Shi-Qing Wang et al In The
