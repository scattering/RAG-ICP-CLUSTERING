Possible Spin Chains in Metallic Ce2Ni2In It is widely believed that the large moments derived from strong spin-orbit coupling in rare-earth based materials lead to classical magnetism There is mounting evidence that emergent energy scales due to orbital exchange can lead to definitive quantum character like fractionalized excitations such as the observation of spinons in neutron scattering measurements on Yb2Pt2Pb evidence for spin charge separation in that emphatically metallic compound where the Yb ions are trivalent and hence magnetic Wu 2016 Gannon 2019 This is evidence that the magnetism in Yb2Pt2Pb can be considered one-dimensional Up to this point virtually all spin chain systems that have been investigated are insulating A question of central interest is whether such a spin system embedded in a metallic environment would have different properties For instance the one-dimensional Kondo necklace first proposed by Doniach Coleman 2010 Doniach 1977 where exchange coupling between conduction electrons and localized moments leads to Kondo compensated or magnetically ordered ground states akin to those seen in three dimensional Kondo lattices which are largely conventional Fermi liquids In the absence of this exchange coupling the magnetic excitations revert to being spinons as in an insulating spin chain This is the situation we envisage for Yb2Pt2Pb Our hypothesis is that there is a phase transition or crossover as a function of J between these two qualitatively different ground states conventional Fermi liquid or magnet vs spin chain coexisting with conduction electrons Fortunately there is a large family of isostructural R2T2X Rrare earth Ttransition metal Xmain group compounds where this hypothesis can likely be tested These compounds form in a layered tetragonal structure with planes of moment-bearing R atoms are arranged into orthogonal dimers Fig1  topologically equivalent to the 2D Shastry-Sutherland lattice Shastry 1981 where magnetic order can be frustrated and where dimensionality plays a decisive role If the planes in a R2T2X system are far apart the magnetism is highly two-dimensional as in Yb2Si2Al Gannon 2018 and Ce2Ge2Mg Gannon 2020 while if they are far apart the system can be thought of as a quasi-one dimensional ladder of orthogonal dimers as in Yb2Pt2Pb and Ce2Pt2Pb Kim 2011 The Yb- conduction electron exchange coupling in 1D Yb2Pt2Pb is vanishing small leading to spinon excitations that are similar to those found in insulating spin chains In contrast Yb2Si2Al shows evidence for strong exchange that leads to mixed valence behavior with a characteristic temperature scale of 300 K Gannon 2018 although it is 2D not 1D Fig 1 Illustration of the structure of Ce2Ni2In Only Ce atoms are shown left View of the basal plane right Side view The black lines represent the unit cell We have explored the R2T2X compound Ce2Ni2In Lukachuk 2003 Kaczorowski 1996 Gordon 1994 and our experiments suggest that may be the mixed valent 1D system that we seek Fig 1 The lattice spacing along the c-axis in Ce2Ni2In is relatively short compared to the in-plane Ce spacing suggesting that the magnetism is likely 1D as in Yb2Pt2Pb The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility T above T800 K is Curie-Weiss after subtracting a constant offset of 0  168x10-4mol-Cecm3 shown in Fig 2AB with effective magnetic moments of 241 Bohr magnetonsCe atom almost the full moment for Ce3 as expected from Hunds rules 254 The Weiss constant is -200K indicating antiferromagnetic correlations along the 001 direction The most prominent feature of the susceptibility is its broad maximum centered at 300 K while below 100 K an additional upturn is observed that continues unabated to the lowest temperature 18 K The original of this upturn is unknown One possibility is that there are stray magnetic impurities present and indeed a Curie-Weiss fit Fig 2C provides an acceptable description of the data revealing a fluctuating moment of only 02 Bohr magnetons Weiss constant -26K Our refinements of the x-ray diffraction patterns rule out secondary phases or any type of site disorder of this magnitude In addition little variation in the Curie constant is observed among different samples These are indications that the source of the upturn could be intrinsic Support for this comes from specific heat measurements Fig 3A which also display an upturn in CT at the lowest temperatures Intriguingly the entropy associated with this upturn Fig 3B is in rough agreement with the moment inferred from the susceptibility measurements Taken together the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements are suggestive that Ce2Ni2In may be close to magnetic order and that they are the consequence of critical fluctuations that are quantum mechanical not thermal in origin We have found no clear evidence for magnetic order in the specific heat measurements to temperatures as low as 005 K The broad maximum in the susceptibility is a fingerprint of strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the Ce f-electrons with an approximate scale of 300 K In the context of the Anderson impurity model this strong hybridization leads to mixed valent character where the Ce 4f-electrons fluctuate among single ion states with different charge and spin The lack of saturation in the isothermal magnetization Fig 2D supports this interpretation suggesting that a very large field would be required to decouple the conduction electrons enabling the subsequent polarization of the f-electrons We have separately requested time on BT-7 to establish the basic energy scales of the Ce magnetism in Ce2Ni2In Since these experiments are carried out on a powder they do not provide information about possible spinons which are the most direct proof that the magnetism is 1D The current proposal will search for spinons using DCS Fig 2 A Mag susceptibility of Ce2Ni2In H 01 T along 001 B-C Inverse of the mag susceptibility for high and low temperatures respectively Fits to Currie-Weiss law are shown in blue low-T and red high-T D Isothermal magnetization measured at T19 K Our previous work on Yb2Pt2Pb Wu 2015 Gannon 2019 has shown that the spinons are evident as a continuum of states that disperse along the c-axis while being dispersionless and possibly gapped in the basal plane The dispersion itself has a distinctive fan-like appearance with a lower boundary that can be fitted to determine the exchange coupling for the moments while the complete spectrum of fractionalized excitations can be computed to determine parameters for the XXZ Hamiltonian describing the anisotropy of the moments themselves ie Heisenberg to Ising We do not know what the impact of the mixed valent character of the Ce moments will be on the putative spinons and this is the objective of our experiments in the R2T2X compounds If the coupling between the Ce 4f-electrons and the conduction electrons is sufficiently weak then the spin-only character of the spinons protects them even in a metal where there are gapless charge excitations This is apparently the case in our work on Yb2Pt2Pb If the coupling is strong then a description in terms of a moderately correlated metal may be more appropriate In the absence of magnetic order 3D analogs display a broad continuum of quantum critical states that arise from proximity to order leading to pronounced non-Fermi liquid properties of the low energy excitations We presume that something similar could happen in a 1D Kondo chain although it is possible that the fundamental excitations may still be spinons the signature excitation of spin chains Neutron scattering measurements are the most direct method to seek evidence for 1D excitations and perhaps spinons

Crystals of Ce2Ni2In are prepared from a self-flux and have a typical weight of several mg Since the crystals grow as long needles with a rectangular cross section it is possible that we can easily align as much as 2-3 grams of crystals on thin Al plates to form our neutron scattering sample As for Yb2Pt2Pb we will use the HHL scattering plane so that we can test whether there is any 1D character to the excitations and if so whether those excitations could be spinons We request the dilution refrigerator with the 14 T superconducting magnet and most of the experiments will be carried out at base temperature Based on our previous experience DCS has the ideal range of energies and wave vectors for experiments of this type An initial energy of 312 meV will be used although we would have the flexibility to go to higher or lower incident energies as needed However quite long counting times will be needed to get data that are convincing For Yb2Pt2Pb this meant that one rotation would take approximately 24 hours Because of the In absorption we calculated that given the above energy our sample has a 1e penetration depth abs of 0183 cm in Ce2Ni2In less sample will be in the beam and as well the Ce moment is smaller than the Yb moment Still we expect that the total counting time could be 2-3 times longer Here we are requesting 5 days on DCS to carry out a feasibility study to look for spinons in Ce2Ni2In including one day for cooldown and a careful vanadium measurement so that we can put any scattering on an absolute scale We seek another 2 days to repeat the experiments in a large field so that one of the Ce sublattices could become completely polarized This should provide information about whether the Ce moments are Ising like or not References Wu LS et
