notation Refer to 3 1By measuring the full-q range available to very small angle neutron scattering vSANS we hope tocapture both the dissolution of the CaAl2O4 grans at low-q and the precipitation of hydration products andtheir nanoscale features at high-q Capturing both the low-q and high-q range simultaneously is criticalto maintain sufficient time resolution to capture both the dissolution and precipitation processes The highresolution detector will provide sufficently low q range to monitor the surface formation of hydration productswhile probing the2 Preliminary WorkPrior work on portland cements had focused on pure Ca3SiO4 and the use of sucrose as a hydrationcontrolling admixture vSANS was performed on hydrating synthesized triclinic and monoclinic Ca3SiO4with and without sucrose Paste were prepared in pure H2O at a water-to-solids ws of 041 Figure 1ashow the scattering results for triclinic Ca3SiO4 in H2O The scattering profiles show an increase in intensityat high-q at the expense of interfacial area at low-q We attribute the reduction at low-q to the dissolutionof Ca3SiO4 to Ca2and the increase at high-q to the production of C-S-H globules10-5 10-3 10-1 101 103 105Iq cm-12 4 6 80012 4 6 8012 4q -16050403020100Time ha Triclinic C3S100806040200Sv m2 cm3 605040302010Time hTriclinic C3S in H2OSucrose Addition 0 L g-1 133 L g-1 b Triclinic C3S100806040200Sv m2 cm3 605040302010Time hMonoclinic C3S in H2OSucrose Addition 0 L g-1 133 L g-1c Monoclinic C3SFigure 1 a vSANS measurements of triclinic Ca3SiO4 and Porod surface area for b triclinic Ca3SiO4 andc monoclinic Ca3SiO4 with and without the addition of sucrose The monoclinic polymorph is the stablepolymorph found in cement clinker010008006004002000
