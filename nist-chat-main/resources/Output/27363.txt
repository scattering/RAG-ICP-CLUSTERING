Probing three-dimensional spin wave dispersions in a single crystal sample of the S12 kagome antiferromagnet Barlowite The kagome lattice a two-dimensional lattice of corner-sharing triangles has attracted much attention as an important platform to search for exotic forms of quantum magnetism For instance the spin-12 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice provides an ideal system for the realization of a quantum spin liquid QSL ground state in which the spins are quantum-entangled over long distances but do not break conventional symmetries In a QSL there are no ordered or frozen moments even at a temperature of absolute zero So far herbertsmithite ZnCu3OH6Cl consisting of stacked kagome layers of spin-12 Cu2 ions has been extensively studied as one of the first experimentally realized kagome QSL materials  More interestingly even in the case that long-range magnetic order does develop on the kagome lattice the magnetic excitations can sometimes carry non-trivial topological properties Barlowite Cu4OH6FB is another newly discovered promising candidate material that host kagome lattices3-1 Unlike the ABC type stacking of kagome planes in herbertsmithite at room-temperature barlowite crystallizes in a higher hexagonal symmetry space group with perfect kagome layers formed by spin-12 Cu2 ions exactly on top of each other ie AA type stacking sequence Fig 1 Upon cooling the hexagonal lattice undergoes a structural phase transition at 265 K to a lower symmetry orthorhombic structure71 The spins in the kagome layers account for  of the total magnetic ions in barlowite while the rest form triangular layers in between the kagome layers These interlayer spins presumably link the kagome layers spins and lead to a long-range magnetic order at temperature 15 K 4- The different coordination environment between the kagome Cu and interlayer Cu sites in barlowite also helps in substituting the interlayer Cu with non-magnetic ions while retaining the perfect kagome layer Cu sites Indeed Zn-barlowite has been successfully synthesized by replacing interlayer Cu with Zn 5- Absent magnetic long-range order in Zn-barlowite suggests it a new promising kagome QSL candidate Although barlowite itself is not a QSL material due to the existence of the magnetic long-range order it is still of great importance to investigate further The strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction indicated by large Curie-Weiss temperature -136 K and much lower Neel order temperature 15 K suggests that strong frustration already exists in barlowite4- By investigating the magnetic structure and spin Hamiltonian of this parent compound barlowite could also shed light on the QSL physics of its Zn-substituted analog The difficulty in synthesizing large single crystals suitable for neutron scattering restricts the current study of barlowite and Zn-barlowite Our group developed a novel method which can yield relatively large single crystals of barlowite for neutron scattering study for the first time  These newly-made barlowite crystals have even lower Neel ordering temperatures There are two magnetic transitions a broad transition at TN110 K and a second sharper transition at TN26 K Fig 21 By coalignment of  230 mg deuterated barlowite crystals we were managed to carry out elastic magnetic neutron scattering experiments in barlowite at both the High Flux Isotope Reactor HFIR at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL and the SPINS and the BT-7 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research NCNR lately which provided invaluable information regarding the magnetic structure of this compound Below TN2 we identify the ground state to be a pinwheel q0 kagome spin structure with long-range ordered kagome spin moments and relatively short-range ordered interlayer spins1 Between TN2 and TN1 only the interlayer spins are ordered while the kagome spins are likely in a valence bond crystal state based on numerical simulations1 To further understand the ground state as well as the underlying magnetic interactions in barlowite inelastic neutron scattering INS experiments are necessary We just carried out successful INS experiments at the MACS at NCNR measuring in the HK0 plane Throughout the two experiments we have made detailed characterization of the low-energy magnetic excitations at base temperature 16 K Fig 3a shows a representative intensity map at 07 meV energy transfer at 16 K with a counting time of 12 h One of the most striking findings is the magnetic excitations in the intermediate temperature range 8 K As shown in Fig 3b an enhancement of scattering emerges in a broad peak around Q  08 0  This new feature has slightly different peak position from the spin excitations near 1 0  at 16 K and might be related to the novel valence bond crystal state However due to the small crystal volume and weak scattering from the S12 quantum moments we could only measure three energy transfers 04 meV 07 meV and 115 meV within the VBC state which makes it difficult to extract the full dispersion relation Thus we propose to perform a continued study of the magnetic excitations in barlowite single crystals at 8K with more energy transfers Importantly measurements in the HHL zone will also be performed to probe the interlayer spin interactions to obtain the first direct quantitative estimates of this energy scale This information is crucial in understanding the two competing ground states ie pinwheel q0 order and the valence bond crystal state The MACS instrument is the ideal spectrometer to carry out the proposed experiment because of its efficiency in covering large momentum space and its ultra-high neutron flux The monochromator will be used in the double-focusing mode to maximize the signal An orange cryostat will be required to provide measurement temperatures cover the transition temperature TN2  6 K We will take measurements at both HK0 zone and HHL zone For the HK0 zone we will focus on the intermediate temperature range 8 K and measure several judiciously chosen energies HHL zone measurements will measure both base-T 16 K and intermediate temperate 8 K with judiciously chosen energies Measurements of the sample holder without the sample will be performed to subtract out its background contribution scattering Considering the relatively small neutron scattering cross-section from a spin-12 material and the time for switching scattering zone we estimate that a total beam time of 8 days will be necessary for a successful experiment This proposed experiment will provide an important insight regarding the exotic magnetic excitations in barlowite The results will not only be an essential step forward to determine the ground state and spin Hamiltonian of barlowite but also facilitate the subsequent study of magnetic interactions in its Zn-substituted analog Zn-barlowite and further our understanding of the QSL state References  L Balents Nature 464 199 2010  T Han et al
