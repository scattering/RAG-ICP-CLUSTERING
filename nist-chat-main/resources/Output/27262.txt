solutions Applicants Javen Weston Nour Alawami Steve Hudson and Katie Weigandt Instrument vSANS or NGB30NG7 Configuration 10CB and Anton-Paar 501 RheoSANS set-up with Standard and Lenses Configs Background Previous Couette and capillary RheoSANS experiments showed a sudden decrease in segmental alignment as measured by azimuthal scattering intensity at a scattering angle roughly corresponding to the persistence length of a semi-dilute wormlike micelle solution at elevated shear rates Subsequent Couette RheoSANS experiments were conducted to probe how varying the surfactant and salt concentrations affected the observed peak in the alignment factor the results of which are shown in Figure 1 The salt and surfactant concentrations directly control the micelle microstructure by altering the thermodynamic properties that drive surfactant self-assembly The changes in microstructure manifest as changes to the rheological properties of the solution in ways described by the mean-field theory proposed by Cates and Candau- used by Zou et al- to predict micelle properties like entanglement length persistence length contour length etc from the measured oscillatory and rotational rheology As seen in Fig 1a salt and surfactant concentrations do have quite dramatic effects on the high shear alignment and location of the peak in alignment factor When the alignment factor for these samples is plotted versus the Weissenberg number Wi rather than the shear rate Fig 1b it can be seen that the initial onset of alignment occurs at Wi  1 as expected inset However the alignment behavior at higher Wi deviates greatly from sample to sample even below the peak in segmental alignment Our current hypothesis is that this occurs due to some combination of 1 changes to the longest relaxation time of the micelle network at elevated shear rates similar to the experimental observations made using superposition rheometry by Kim et al which change the Wi number and 2 the shear flow is altering the breakagescission dynamics of the micelles altering the Figure 1 Fitted segmental alignment factors for a selection of semi-dilute wormlike micelle solutions plotted versus shear rate a and Weissenberg number b The plots show that for this family of micelle solutions the onset of alignment occurs at Wi  1 as expected inset but that alignment trends deviate substantially from sample to sample at higher Wi distribution of micelle contour lengths present in solution We propose here experiments to further examine the high Wi alignment transitions of this wormlike micellar system by using salts other than sodium chloride to induce micelle growth Using different salts will allow us to control the scission free energy of the micelles in such a way that we can vary the length of the micelles independently from the surfactant and salt concentrations This will provide greater insights into which of the two proposed mechanisms is primarily responsible for the trends in segmental alignment This proposed work will therefore be an important advance in understanding the structure-property relationships of surfactant micelles which are essential for their use in personal care cosmetics and enhanced oil recovery as well as advancing the fundamental understanding of micelle dynamics under shear The system that we propose to study is a good model since the scattering is relatively easy to interpret and the formulation is similar to those used commercially We have performed preliminary static SANS measurements on the micellessalt combinations of interest and determined that the persistence length does change with the chosen salt species NaCl NaI LiCl MgCl2 Rheological experiments showed different viscosity magnitude for the peak concentration of each salt which for samples of 005M of ethoxylated sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant Steol CS-130 SLE1S at 25oC were 287 Pas at 12M of NaCl 449 Pas at 22M LiCl 282Pas at 05M MgCl2 and 079 Pas at 12M NaI Additionally figure 2a shows that our static SANS test represents that each salt has a different persistence length Using the method presented by Larson  of contour length estimation from the ratio of GG and the persistence length we were also able to estimate the micelle contour lengths for the same array of salts and varying salt concentrations Figure 2b shows that contour length has a different magnitude for each type of salt These results along with the corresponding rheology indicate that the quiescent micelle structure and zero shear viscosity is strongly dependent on both salt concentration and surfactant concentration but when subjected to sufficient shear the micelle dynamics are affected such that the viscosity and degree of alignment become largely independent of salt concentration This hypothesis is reinforced by recent work by Sambasivam et al1 regarding the orientational distribution of rod-like micelles aspect ratio LD  3 under shear flow at high Weissenberg numbers They show that increased micelle scission at high Wi lowers the average micelle length Their results also indicate that there is a critical Wi-independent scission energy and that significantly elevated Wi are necessary to cause appreciable scission for the CTACNaSal micelles they simulated scission can only occur for Wi 50 Another recent paper1 however shows that the free energy for micelle Figure 2 a SANS Experiment fitted average persistence length for a selection of semi-dilute wormlike micelle solutions plotted for four different salts at and before the salt concentration of the highest shear rate viscosity before branching b Calculated contour length from the rheology data of oscillatory and rotational tests along with the persistence length obtained from the SANS Experiment plotted versus the molarity of the salts over each one molarity at the highest zero shear rate viscosity scission is a strong function of salt concentration Which would imply that if scission is a major factor in the observed deviations at high Wi the effect of salt concentration should be more pronounced Lastly recently presented work by Salipante et al has shown a transition from entangled-chain scaling to rod-like scaling at elevated shear rates achieved in a microcapillary rheometer The location of this transition is expected to be dependent on the persistence length of the micelles which we have shown can be altered in this particular system Using the well-developed model recently expanded by Larson et al we have shown that micelle solutions can be prepared with a similar distribution of contour length for each salt by choosing the appropriate salt concentration As illustrated in Fig 2b to obtain a contour length of 08 m we would use 116M of NaCl 174M of LiCl 119M of NaI or 030M of MgCl2 while the species of salt will alter the persistence length These experiments will allow us to directly probe the effect of persistence length on segmental alignment behavior independent of contour length or surfactant chemistry Proposed RheoSANS Experiments The same surfactant used in the previous studies an ethoxylated sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant Steol CS-130 SLE1S will be used here to form wormlike micellar solutions The micelle structure will be controlled using the addition of four different salts NaCl LiCl MgCl2 and NaI We will use figure 2b to match the contour length for the four different salts at three different lengths that will allow us to probe how contour length micelle volume fraction and scission free energy affect the high Wi deviations in alignment behavior shown in Fig 1b The RheoSANS geometry would be installed and all samples from the prepared matrix will be measured at 15-20 shear rates over a range varying from 01 s-1 to 1000 s-1 This high point density is necessary to ensure that the high Wi alignment behavior is captured with sufficient detail for analysis Conducting these experiments on the vSANS instrument will greatly increase the number of conditions that can be tested since it captures the entire q-range of interest at once Additionally the vSANS would sufficiently expand the low-q range of the experiment and allow us to potentially probe changes in micelle contour length at elevated shear rates which would be impossible on either of the 30m instruments However the experiments could be carried out on the 30m instruments though the impact of the research could be lessened The estimated time to conduct this experiment in vSANS would be 2 days given that we need 15 minutes for each shear rate of the 18 shear rates times 12 samples three samples per salt However to run this experiment on the 30m Instrument the estimated time would be 3 days assuming we run each shear rate for 20 minutes  J S Weston D P Seeman D L Blair P F Salipante S D Hudson and K M Weigandt Simultaneous slit rheometry and in situ neutron scattering Rheol Acta vol 57 no 3 2018  M E Cates and S J
