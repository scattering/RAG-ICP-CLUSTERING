Neutron diffraction study on the structure of FeNbSb thermoelectric compounds Scientific Background Thermoelectric materials are attracting a great many of attentions due to its ability to transfer the temperature gradients into electrical potentials This function can be used to improve energy efficiency and to provide new energy source The efficiency of thermoelectric materials can be described using the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT  2Tele  lat where   ele and lat are the Seebeck coefficient the electrical conductivities and the thermal conductivities contributed by charge carriers and lattice vibrations  Heavy doped semiconductors with charger carrier concentration between 1019-1021 carrierscm3 and with low thermal conductivities are considered as promising thermoelectric materials  such as PbTe  and AgSbTe2  Half-Heusler alloys is also considered as a potential high temperature thermoelectric material with a narrow band gap and sharp slope of the density of states near the Fermi level  Although half-Heusler alloys could have relatively high power factor in both ZrNiSn-based n-type  and FeNbSb-based p-type half-Heusler alloys  the high thermal conductivities hinder further improvement of zT Fortunately proper selection of doping elements could introduce strong point defects in the half-Heusler matrix which could disturb the phonon propagation  A great many of efforts to reduce the thermal conductivity from different aspects have been reported in the past several years such as nanostructuralization  phase separation  nano-precipitates 1 and so on Recently hierarchical phonon scattering mechanism was introduced into the half-Heusler thermoelectric materials As shown in Fig 1 low frequency high frequency and full frequency phonons are respectively scattered by the sub-microscale grain boundaries B point defects PD and electron-phonon coupling EP in FeNb08Ti02Sb and Fe1xNb075Ti025 1 It is also found that electron-phonon coupling may also play an important role in the suppression of lattice thermal conductivities in FeNb1-xTxSb T  Ti Zr and Hf 1 However most of these phonon scattering mechanisms is studied base on transport measurements Direct evidences is scarce to support these conclusions Especially for the phonon scattering by electron-phonon interactions there is even no direct observation in other thermoelectric materials Therefore we synthesized a series of FeNb1-xTxSb T  Zr Ta and Hf alloys and want to apply neutron scattering technique to study both the static and dynamic structures Preliminary Work 4 grams of FeNb1-xTxSb T  Zr Ta and Hf polycrystalline samples have been prepared The electric resistances total and lattice thermal conductivities and Seebeck parameters as well as carrier concentration have been measured as shown in Fig 2 It is clear that the doping of Ta and Hf effectively reduces the Fig 1 a A schematic illustration of hierarchical phonon scattering b Phonon frequency dependence of lattice thermal conductivity with different phonon scattering mechanism c Temperature-dependent lattice thermal conductivities in ball milled FeNb08Ti02Sb and Fe1xNb075Ti025 1 thermal conductivity It is also worth to note that Ta and Hf have different abilities to suppress lattice thermal conductivities although both elements have similar atomic masses and radii Aims of the proposed experiment Here we propose to use the high-resolution powder diffractometer BT-1 to study the effects of different elements doping on the Nb site in FeNbSb thermoelectric materials on the temperature-dependent lattice parameters atomic occupations mean-squared displacements as well as nuclear density distribution The corresponding results combining with further dynamic phonon DOSs measurements can provide a microscopic picture on the effects of different phonon scattering mechanisms on the lattice thermal conductivities in half-Huesler compounds Justification for use of neutron scattering Half Heusler-based thermoelectric materials are semiconductor compounds Compared with x-ray diffraction neutron diffraction could exclude the effects of electrons and hence provide more accurate information about the atomic positions and the mean squared displacements Such information is of great importance for us to take further inelastic neutron scattering experiments for phonon dispersions In addition the high resolution and relatively large Q-space of BT-1 is a proper choice for us to carry out the measurement as proposed in this project Experiment Plan We will measure the temperature-dependence diffraction patterns of FeNbSb and FeNb1-xTxSb with T  Zr x  01 Ta x  01 and Hf x  01 The measurements will be carried out over the temperature range from 300K to 700K with 50 K per step Each pattern will be collected for 2 hours Including the time for sample warming cooling and exchanging we estimate that 4 days of beam time will be necessary The data will be analyzed using FullProf suite Then the maximum-entropy-method MEM based pattern fitting will be taken to obtain the nuclear density distribution information Safety Considerations The sample does not present any hazards References  G J
