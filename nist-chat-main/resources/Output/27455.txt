AntiperovskiteHeusler alloy non-colinear AF reconstructed superlattice system a route to tailored spin textures Alexander Grutter Lu Guo Tianxiang Nan Neil Campbell Thomas Tybell and Chang-Beom Eom Tailoring magnetic materials in order to develop energy efficient devices for information technology is a major driving force for modern spintronics research Antiferromagnetic AF materials are especially important1 as they offer ultra-high frequency spin dynamics and at the same time robustness against magnetic perturbations In this regard non-collinear AFs are interesting as they exhibit topologically-protected states2 From a device perspective opportunities such as the anomalous Hall effect AHE33 and large spin transfer torque and spin orbit torque effects3 can be harnessed In order to optimize such technology a fundamental understanding of and methodologies to tailor the AF spin structure at magnetic interfaces are needed4 One interesting proposition is to use interfaces between two emerging magnetic quantum materials Heusler alloys which exhibit a large number of possible topological properties5 such as Weyl nodes7 and antiperovskites which stabilize frustrated non-collinear AF This enables engineering of the spin structures using both interfacial magnetic interactions and epitaxial strain The antiperovskite Mn3XN MXN XGa or Ni and the Heusler alloy Mn3Ga are promising materials for realizing this magnetic interface Their atomic structures are shown in Fig1 Mn3Ga is a ferrimagnetic Heusler alloy with large out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy making it promising for fast spin switching and spin transfer torque devices MXN materials have AF spin configurations lying in the 111-plane establishing a frustrated noncollinear AF ground state Mn3GaN stabilizes a 5g see Fig 1 spin configuration while Mn3NiN stabilizes both 5g and 4g with a temperature-dependent transition In order to probe coupling at MXNHeusler interfaces epitaxial superlattices of 001-oriented Mn3GaNMn3Ga on LSAT have been synthesized by sputtering Squid magnetometry and transport characterization have been performed on bilayers and superlattices of Mn3GaN and Mn3Ga showing high-quality and reproducibility Particularly a small net moment and clear anomalous Hall effect have been observed in monolayer Mn3GaN thin films demonstrating their susceptibility to magnetic distortions Furthermore preliminary spin polarized reflectivity measurements of 001 oriented Mn3GaNMn3Ga superlattices obtained at NIST Gaithersburg USA are highly promising for further 1 V Baltz et al Rev Mod Phys 90 015005

both the Mn3GaN and Mn3Ga layers is observed The AF antiperovskite Mn3GaN layers display an emergent net magnetic moment while the Heusler alloy Mn3Ga exhibits an increased magnetization at the interfaces This modification of the magnetic ground state in MXNHeusler superlattices points towards the possibility of tuning the magnetic properties of both AF antiperovskites and Heusler alloys when deposited on oxide materials The increased magnetic response seen at the interfaces is especially interesting as it may be attributable to a change in magnetic anisotropy andor spin structure The prospect of tuning magnetic anisotropy and spin structure in magnetic heterostructures can result in optimized spin structures for emerging devices relying on spin transfer and spin orbit effects We note that spin-polarized neutron reflectivity measurements can probe not only the magnetization depth profile along the applied field but also the in-plane perpendicular magnetization component through spin-flip scattering In this way it should be possible to address the question of the origin of the reconstruction as changes in anisotropy or spin reconstruction due to frustration often lead to perpendicular magnetization components From work interfacing Mn3GaN thin films with permalloy we have observed that the Mn3GaN spin structure anisotropy couples through to the permalloy This manifests itself in in-plane anisotropy for the permalloy with easy axes along the directions of in-plane magnetic moments of the Mn3GaN Since Mn3Ga has an out of plane anisotropy we expect the interface-induced anisotropy to be different from permalloy and likely a result of the Mn3GaN spins with out-of-plane components Furthermore should there be a microscopic reconstruction it should impact the Mn3Ga anisotropy In addition to interfacial coupling effects the Mn stoichiometry is known to modulate the magnetization of Mn3Ga8 Given the inherent complexity of superlattices this effect is likely present in some capacity This presents an alternative explanation for the enhancement of the magnetization at the interfaces and it is therefore critical to understand the Mn content of these samples in detail in order to understand and customize the magnetic ground state With the strong negative neutron scattering length of Mn polarized neutron reflectometry measurements offer greatly increased sensitivity to Mn content relative to X-ray techniques allowing the contributions of interface coupling and Mn-diffusion to be separated Proposed research We therefore propose to perform spin polarized neutron reflectivity measurements on one Mn3GaNMn3Ga bilayer sample and one Mn3GaNMn3Ga superlattice sample at the PBR beamline 1 Mn3GaN 20 nmMn3Ga 20 nm bilayer on LSAT 1X1 cm2 2 Mn3GaN 12 nmMn3Ga 8 nm superlattice on LSAT 1X1 cm2 By measuring both spin polarized neutron reflectivity and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry of the Mn3GaNMn3Ga bilayer we will address the influence of Mn stoichiometry on the magnetic properties If it is N or Mn diffusion which induced a net magnetization in the Mn3GaN we may expect to see a Figure 2 Spin polarized reflectivity measurements of a Mn3GaN Mn3Ga superlattices transition in the thicker bilayer layers below which no induced magnetization is observed Comparison between PNR and SIMS will differentiate the effects of Mn and N By measuring spin polarized neutron reflectivity of the Mn3GaNMn3Ga superlattice with different applied field directions specifically along both the 100 and 110 directions we will address whether any in-plane magnetic anisotropy exists from interfacial coupling between the different magnetic layers Particularly we will elucidate 1 What is the composition in Mn3GaN and Mn3Ga layer How does the stoichiometry affect the magnetism in the sample 2 In the Mn3GaNMn3Ga superlattice does the small net magnetization show in-plane anisotropy Measurement Time and Feasibility The preliminary PNR measurements are extremely promising as shown in the reflectivity and spin asymmetry plotted in Fig 3 alongside theoretical fits for a Mn3GaNMn3Ga superlattice at room temperature As can be seen the superlattice allows us to probe the spin asymmetry up to high-Q values of 18 nm-1 This allows us to detect the 001 through 005 superlattice Bragg reflections providing for incredible sensitivity to the interface magnetization Based on the preliminary measurements we estimate that measuring each sample in the range of 0-18 nm-1 will require 48-72 hours per condition We therefore request 7 days of beam time to account for one bilayer sample measured at room temperature measurement and one superlattice sample measured with two different in-plane field direction The obtained data will be supplemented by magnetometry SIMS and transport measurements including AHE to build a complete picture of the emergent magnetic state in the superlattices In the future we hope to extend this work with X-ray dichroism studies with the goal of obtaining a thorough understanding on how AF spin structures can be tailored based on antiperosvkiteHeusler alloy superlattices
