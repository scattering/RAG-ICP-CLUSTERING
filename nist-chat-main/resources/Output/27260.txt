Preliminary Data Phytoglycogen is a highly branched natural polysaccharide produced in the form of compact nanoparticles Fig 1 in the kernels of sweet corn The unique properties of phytoglycogen nanoparticles including their softness porosity and mechanical integrity as well as nontoxicity and biodegradability make them ideal functional ingredients for applications involving the human body This technology is being commercialized by our industrial partner Mirexus Biotechnologies We have used SANS and QENS to study the structure and hydration properties of aqueous dispersions of phytoglycogen nanoparticles 3 Our most recent SANS data on high purity particles revealed the presence of hairy chains decorating the outer surface of the 22 nm radius particles as described by a core-coil model  Fig 2a Contrast series SANS measurements revealed that the particles contain 250 of their own mass in water 3 and infrared absorption measurements revealed that the hydration water is very highly ordered  Our rheology measurements on concentrated aqueous dispersions of phytoglycogen nanoparticles revealed the soft nature of the particles and allowed us to identify an additional relaxation process that was consistent with a hairy colloid particle geometry  Stimuli-responsive particles that dynamically change their size shape or structure in response to external stimuli such as temperature and pH are attractive materials for a wide variety of applications It is possible to introduce a stimuli-responsive behavior to phytoglycogen nanoparticles by modifying them with octenyl succinic anhydride OSA a food grade modification of starch For OSA-phytoglycogen there are competing effects due to the presence of a negatively charged carboxylic acid group pKa  4 which promotes electrostatic repulsion between particles at neutral pH and a hydrophobic chain which produces an effective attractive interaction between particles in aqueous dispersions The importance of these effects can be tuned by varying the degree of substitution DS and the relative strengths of the two effects can be tuned by adjusting the pH of the solution The effect of OSA modification of phytoglycogen is visually striking At rest concentrated dispersions at neutral pH form gels that do not flow Application of shear eg by shaking the dispersion immediately liquifies the sample when shear is removed the liquid quickly re-gels These reversible dramatic changes in the mechanical properties upon the application and removal of shear indicates weakly attractive interactions due to the hydrophobic modification The Figure 1 a Molecular dynamics simulation of a phytoglycogen nanoparticle  illustrating their hairy colloid particle geometry b Atomic force microscopy image of phytoglycogen nanoparticles in water at small upper and large lower applied forces  b 2 extreme sensitivity to shear can be probed using rheology to measure eg the yield stress and the critical shear rate for the onset of shear thinning The highly shear-sensitive behaviour can be seen clearly in Fig 3 A 20 ww aqueous dispersion of low DS OSA-phytoglycogen at neutral pH forms a highly viscous gel that exhibits shear-thinning over the entire range of measured shear rates red symbols A low shear Newtonian plateau which is often observed in typical shear-thinning materials at sufficiently small shear rates is inaccessible for the low DS OSA-phytoglycogen dispersion and the sample instead undergoes shear-thinning even at the smallest measurable shear rate of 10-3 s-1 This result emphasizes the extreme shear-sensitivity of the low DS OSA-phytoglycogen In contrast an aqueous dispersion of native phytoglycogen at the same concentration 20 ww behaves as a low viscosity Newtonian fluid black symbols The OSA modification clearly has a significant effect on the interaction between particles and it is important to understand the structural arrangement of the OSA molecules and changes to this arrangement in the presence of flow To address this we propose to combine rheology with SANS Rheo-SANS to study the structure of concentrated dispersions under different flow conditions Recently we performed SANS measurements of OSA-phytoglycogen with small and large values of DS  A distinctive additional peak was observed in the high-q regime of the SANS curve measured for high DS OSA-phytoglycogen that could be attributed to collapsed OSA-modified chains on the outer surface of the particles resulting in an excellent fit to the raspberry model particle geometry 4 Fig 2b At the low-q end of the data a structure factor becomes apparent illustrating particle interactions that will be critical to understanding the rheological behavior These data indicate the power of using neutrons to reveal the detailed structure of the particle geometry Aims of the Proposed Experiments and Estimate of Beamtime We will build on the success of our previous SANS experiments as follows We propose to use the Rheo-SANS environment to investigate how the structure of concentrated dispersions of OSA-phytoglycogen 20 ww evolves under shear to provide insight into the shear-sensitive gel behaviour As shown in Fig 2b the non-exchangeable hydrocarbons in the OSA tails provide sufficient contrast when dispersed in 100 D2O to characterize the OSA modification of the outer surface of the particles with a distinctive scattering feature at high corresponding to collapsed chains of OSA-modified glucose Simultaneous rheology measurements in the Rheo-SANS environment will provide insight into the effects of OSA modification on the particle-particle Figure 2 SANS scattering intensity spectra for 1 ww D2O dispersions of a native phytoglycogen particles showing excellent agreement with

interactions at high concentrations under shear and allow us to better understand the interplay between the electrostatic and hydrophobic aspects of the OSA modification We will measure low DS and high DS OSA-phytoglycogen in D2O at 1 10 20 and 25 ww at neutral pH For each sample we will perform SANS measurements during steady shear rheology To accomplish our objectives we request 3 days of access to the NGB 30m SANS instrument equipped with the Anton Paar MCRXX1 rheometer listed as available for the Rheo-SANS environment Previous SANS experiments have shown that the samples scatter strongly Our request of 3 days is based on the following estimates  Baseline structure measurements of 7 samples three concentrations 10 20 and 25 ww 2 DS values and the unmodified native particl background and controls 12 h  Sweep through shear rates 1 h collections for 7 samples at 8 strain rates in the range 001 to 1000 s-1 to identify the structural changes at the onset of shear thinning and the apparent yield stress 60 h Publications and Impact The proposed work will provide unique insight into the structure-flow relationship for shear-sensitive thixotropic concentrated dispersions of OSA-phytoglycogen We will obtain new fundamental knowledge of the delicate balance between electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic attraction in this tunable soft colloid system which we expect will lead to publication in a high impact journal In addition this work will help to identify new applications for OSA-phytoglycogen which is of great interest to our industrial partner Mirexus
