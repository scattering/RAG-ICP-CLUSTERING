Magnetic cluster distribution in Ni-V alloys VSANSFormation of ferromagnetism in metals is still an active eld for discovery of novel phasesand mechanisms in condensed matter physics  In particular the control of disorder anddetermination of how inhomogeneities a ect magnetic properties remain a signi cant challengeThe binary transition metal alloy Ni1 xVx presents an opportunity to study a diluted inho-mogeneous ferromagnet FM produced by random atomic distribution 2 The onset of FMof Ni at Tc  630K is suppressed towards zero with su cient V concentration of xc  116 This system presents a rare example of a quantum critical point QCP in a FM metalthat is accompanied by a Quantum Gri ths phase  Previous magnetization and SR studiesshow the relevant signatures of uctuating clusters  from Ni-rich regions for PM samples withx  xc These persist also into the FM state close to xc and coexist with the static order evolving below Tc This proposed SANS experiment aims to reveal the important lengths scalesin a disordered FM at the edge of a QCP SANS is an ideal tool to discriminate between longrange order and short range clusters which remain visible in the accessible nite Q-range Weexpect to estimate the important correlation lengths in the FM at low T at x  xc before itchanges to a cluster glass freezing for x  114 These data can show that indeed clustersand long range order coexist and provide evidence and scales for magnetic clusters responsiblefor the claimed Gri ths phase We expect to gain important new information about disorderedferromagnets close to the QCPIn addition to non polarized SANS data from GPSANS ORNL we collected already polar-ized SANS data at NG7SANS and got promising results We applied strategies  to analyze thedata to successfully extract short-range magnetic clusters and long-range domains contributionsfrom spin ip SF and non spin ip NSF di erences For Ni090V010 we nd evidence formagnetic clusters from Lorentzian line shapes with correlation lengths of 10nm that remainat low temperatures T  3K far below Tc47K with a fraction of about 10 as shown in FigFigure 1 left NSF di erence DIFV  2NMx vs wave vector Q for Ni090V010

demonstrate that in this disordered FM short-range clusters and long-range ordercoexist with length scales ranging from 10nm to m The Ni090V010 data have been presentedat the MMM2019 conference and will be published  However the most relevant data forNi089V011 closest to the QCP at xc  116 show the expected trends but are not of su -cient quality for a publication The magnetic SF scattering from the sample is smaller than thelarge time-dependent depending on the neighboring beamline NG6 SF background scatteringmeasured on an empty sample holder MT with only the non-magnetic Al-foil in the beam atNG7SANS This large BG is angle and Q-dependent and reduces the reliable SF scattering ofthe sample to a narrow Q-regime as shown in Fig1 middle a and right Without this BGthe error bars of the magnetic SF scattering from the sample would improve at least by a factorof 2 to get su cient statistics to analyze Q-dependence and to t angular dependence at lowT This would nally allow to reveal correlation lengths of magnetic components perpendicularand parallel to the eld at low T in small and higher eldsWe choose the instrument vSANS that is best suited for polarized neutron studies providingincreasing counting statistics coupled with a time-independent background improved polariza-tion optics and a much larger Q-range accessible with the polarization optics as compared withNG7SANS That will improve the signal to noise ratio of the SF data signi cantly With a newexperiment on vSANS we expect to make signi cant progress towards the main goal of tracingthe impact of disorder in Ni1 xVx We already see remaining clusters below Tc in addition tolong range domains at two di erent concentrations close to xc With better statistics at thehigh concentration x  11 we aim to characterize the critical scattering at Tc and magneticresponse at low T to point out further anomalies due to the disorder In addition a study ofdi erent lower concentrations down to x  0 will probe the origin of the clusters will dis-criminate if the observed short range clusters are caused by V or by structural defects like grainboundaries Magnetic clusters should not be present in pure Ni the cluster ratio should be smallin Ni091V009 according to the magnetization and SR estimate  Therefore we propose toinvestigate a pure Ni sample and x  9 sample prepared with the same protocol for randomatomic distribution 2 With improved background at vSANS we expect to collect full polar-ized SANS data of Ni089V011 with su cient statistics to get publishable data revealing moredetailed information Besides extracting cluster fraction and correlation length estimates wealso hope to probe deviations from Lorentzian line shapes in describing data in an extended Q-regime Also more data at several T below Tc are required to study the T-dependence that canbe compared directly to magnetization data 4 To further improve the transmission thermalcontact and sample holder contribution we plan to use discs with reduced thickness 2mm and at surface instead of the pills of 3mm diameter studied previously that stick easily on a siliconor sapphire plate with H-free glueWe plan to investigate three di erent concentrations of Ni1 xVx at vSANS with fullpolarization analysis We use mostly disc shaped samples of 2mm thickness about 15for each concentration As potential background data for mostly nuclear scattering and tostudy the eld dependence a horizontal magnetic eld of 0-15T is required Also to accesstemperatures well below Tc a cryostat with Tmin 3K will be needed Data will be collectedwith  55 A with 4 guides and frontmiddle detectors distances at 4m19m to cover the Q-range of 003 13nm 1 Primarily x  11 with Tc  7K will be investigated with su cientstatistics at base temperature in selected magnetic elds  4 in a wide Q-range with about15hrun in polarized x4 mode few data points in half polarized x2 and non polarized modeAlso data at Tc and at selected lower T and higher T  4 will be recorded in polarized andhalfpolarizednon polarized mode 35 days for x  11 Similar data will be collected forx  9 at low temperatures T  5K and at Tc  110K in small and high elds 4 runs 1 dayfor 9 In addition we will measure pure Ni samples in a similar set up at room temperature300K  Tc  630K For best comparison we collect data from pills 7 pills with 3mm diameterand from discs in the same Q-range in low 02T and high 15T elds 2x 2runs 1 day for0 Extra time 05 days is required also for an empty cell and empty cryostat measurementto cool down the cryostat between sample holder changes and to exchange the He3pol cell Wewill use a polarized beam with the eld perpendicular to the beam to analyze the spin ipnospin ip contrasts in the di erent sectors in the detectorsA total of 6 days is needed to characterize the magnetic clusters to evaluate cluster ratio andmagnetic correlations of a weak FM and a strong FM The comparison with the strongest FMwithout any induced chemical disorder will shed light on the origin of these clusters For datareduction and analysis we take advantage of the provided Igor pro software We continue to em-ploy our previous strategies to reveal consistently magnetic scattering in a wide Q-regime frompolarized and halfpolarized data comparing with non polarized data We hope to get su cientstatistics in a wide Q-regime to go beyond simple t functions like Lorentzians and Lorentziansquares to describe the data to see the impact of disorder in a FM close to the QCPReferences Brando M Belitz D Grosche F M and Kirkpatrick
