Dynamics of oxygen transport in Perovskites with in situ generated alloy nanoparticles Xin Yang12 Peng Qiu1 and Kevin Huang1 1 Department of Mechanical Engineering University of South Carolina 300

cell applications because of their high conductivity electrocatalytic activity chemical compatibility and adequate thermal match with adjacent cell components Most recently development on perovskite oxide as fuel electrode are attracting more interests for hydrocarbon fuel conversions Unlike conventional Nickle-based metal electrode perovskite has better stability under hydrocarbon fuel operation owing to its unique structure while Ni promotes carbon cracking under fuel cell operation temperatures 600-800 C leading to severe coking which can quickly deactivate the electrode Thus pure hydrogen needs to be used to the fuel electrode with Ni-based electrodes which impedes its practical applications Fig 1 Crystal structure and electrode performance Sr2FeMo23Mg13O6- a Room temperature Neutron

Development of Ni-free perovskite-based anodes provides a new route for solving the carbon deposition issue Despite the ability to solve the coking problem the catalytic activity of perovskite oxide anodes for fuel oxidation is much lower than that of Ni-based anode leading to much lower cell performance power output One strategy shown to improve the electrocatalytical activity is to optimize the oxygen vacancy concentration As presented in Fig 1 Mg doping in Sr2Fe15Mo05O3- SCFM shows exceptionally high performance via optimizing oxygen vacancy concentration Power X-ray diffraction refinement can provide structure information including space group and atom positions However XRD refinement cannot determine oxygen vacancy concentration Appropriate oxygen vacancy concentrationdistribution is beneficial for high electrochemical performance since it enables fast diffusion of oxygen ions which is key to contributing good ionic conductivity and fast electrode reaction kinetics Neutron powder diffraction is more sensitive to light elements and is able to provide more information regarding oxygen position and oxygen vacancy concentrations Thus it would be very important to determine the oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskites prepared in different conditions Previous results As shown in Fig2a Co doped SCFM is prepared via citric-nitrate method After reduction in pure H2 at 900 C for 2 h the double perovskite phase converts into mixed phase containing an alloy phase and a RP phase Fig 2b Rietveld refinement conducted on the XRD date further confirms the compositions and unite-cell information The RP phase is identified as Sr3Co01Fe13Mo06O7-with the space group of I4mmm and the alloy phase is identified as Co-Fe with a space group of Pm-3m Interestingly the product after SCFM reduction containing RP-SCFM and CFANs is re-sintered in air at 900 C for 2 h it can be restored to SCFM with the double perovskite phase indicating its excellent redox reversibility Fig 2c

electrode surfaces In situ exsolution of nanoscale catalyst shows to yield well-dispersed metallic or alloy nanoparticles It is obvious that the differences in the lattice fringe orientation and the interplanar spacing between nanoparticles and substrate Fig 3 Single solid oxide fuel cells are fabricated with SCFM as both air and fuel electrodes SCFM electrode shows excellent stability under methane operation for up to 150 h However we are still lack of structural information for fundamental research on such a stable and highly active electrode which would be beneficial for material design Fig 3 ac HRTEM images of RP-SCFM-CFANs grain d The fourier transform of red position e The fourier transform of blue position Proposed experiments Here we have and synthesized about 5 grams high quality polycrystalline samples by the citrate-nitrate method  We thus apply for one day of beam time for neutron diffraction measurements at NIST at 298K to determine the structure of both SCFM powder and reduced SFCM with Co-Fe alloy Please collect high quality data sets 8 hours scans each and this will enable us to conduct Rietveld refinement We apply for the mail-in serve and we are willing to take the advice of a local contact If needed one of the authors can present during the experiment References  Z Du H Zhao S Li Y Zhang X Chang Q Xia N Chen L Gu K Swierzek Y Li T Yang and K
