Aim of the StudyLithium - ion batteries have a range of important applications with electric vehicles merely oneof the most well known to the wider public Electric vehicles are a growth industry but whiledevelopment of the batteries is forever progressing the energy densities do not yet equal or surpassthe internal combustion engine As such it is important to continue to improve all aspects of thecell from its chemical composition to the geometry of its components Amongst the variety ofbattery types being investigated the lithium sulfur Li-S cell is a promising candidate for highenergy density battery systems Additionally since the use of conventional liquid electrolytes leadsto continual degradation of the performance of Li-S batteries the use of solid state electrolytes for afunctioning all solid state cell is desirable Unfortunately signi cant physiochemical challengesremain despite excellent theoretical performance2 3  While much focus has given to thedegradation mechanisms at the electrodes and the electrode  electrolyte interface5 6  thecontribution to the reduction in cell capacity from the loss of ion transport pathways in theelectrolyte that is the focus of this experimentPreliminary resultsWe have made some preliminary neutron tomography measurements on a suitable Li-S cell usingthe CONRAD beam line at the Helmholtz Zentrum in Berlin Germany HZB The cell comprisesof a Li-In anode a Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte layer and a C-S cathode These measurement werefocused on testing the functionality of this particular cell composition and the degradation incapacity after cyclingFigure 1 Relative change in lithium mass for each component of the cell as a function of timeThe suggested net gain in total mass is due to the lithium packing being di erent in each compo-nent which the present calculation does not take into account The calculation used the lithiumattenuation coe cient appropriate for the anode More information about the lithium packing inthe cathode and electrolyte layer is necessary to calculate accurate values for these regions1Radiography was performed throughout the discharge and charge cycles As is evident from Figure1 even though the magnitude of the calculated values require use of a more appropriate lithiumattenuation coe cient that more accurately models the lithium packing it is noticeable that theoverall change in mass of lithium in the electrolyte layer does not change signi cantly Howevervarying the isotopic contrast between the lithium initially present in the electrolyte layer andthat entering from the anode is necessary to discern more speci c information about the lithiumtransport through the electrolyteProposed ExperimentIn the course of this experiment we propose to perform in-situ neutron tomography measurementson a solid state Lithium  Sulphur Li-S battery The cell composition will be the same asdescribed in the preliminary measurements above We intend to ascertain more clearly the lithiumtransport pathways through the cell with the ultimate aim of discerning how they degrade duringcycling In order to achieve this we shall use an anode selectively enriched with 6-lithium in contrastto the solid electrolyte which will maintain the natural lithium isotopic mixture of 6-lithium and7-lithium After cycling the battery the vast di erence in neutron attenuation coe cient between6-lithium and 7-lithium will hopefully show a variation in the contrast of the electrolyte regionbetween that which still contains only the natural mixture and that which now contains a greaterproportion of 6-lithium This data should provide information as to the mechanisms of the lithiumion transport through the electrolyte region It is important to note that the sample should notbe enriched with too much 6-lithium lest the neutron beam become attenuated to too greater adegreeA custom-made aluminium housing will be employed which has been successfully tested previouslyat HZB to contain the cell The thermal neutrons from BT-2 will be used to gain information onthe lithium migration through the electrolyte The anode will comprise of areas containing lithiumwith just the naturally occurring isotopic mix and those with an enhanced 6-lithium proportionWe intend to run radiography measurements while cycling and tomography at speci c points in thedischarge  charge cycle These will be at 100 75 50 25 and 0 charge For the sampleenvironment we shall require a rotation stage that will allow tomography through a full 360 rotation A suitable sample holder can be brought from HZB if necessary The electrochemicalcycling will be controlled by use of a potentiostat with the cycling parameters being an upperlimit of 30V and a lower limit of 04V with a current of 142mA The sample will have a required eld of view of 4 mm in the horizontal plane by 300 m in the vertical plane Prior measurementsat HZB used a pixel size of 65 m which we would like to replicate hereWe are requesting ve days of beam time in order to perform in-situ neutron radiography andtomography This will comprise of ve tomographies each cycle and would like to cycle thebattery twice from 100 to 0 state of charge if possible We shall also be measuring radiographyduring the cycling process Using a Lithium - Indium anode enriched with the 6-lithium isotopeinformation on lithium transport pathways through the solid electrolyte will be obtained througha sustained charge  discharge cycle We expect to see a variation in the neutron attenuationbetween the regions in the battery containing the natural mix of 7-lithium and 6-lithium andthose where the proportion of 6-lithium is greater When the battery is cycled we should see achange in the neutron attenuation of the solid electrolyte in regions adjacent to the enriched partof the anode This change in contrast will provide signi cant new information on the mechanismsof lithium ion transport through the electrolyte2References M Wild L
