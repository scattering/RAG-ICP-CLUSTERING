Inelastic Neutron Scattering Study on the Spin Dynamics of Ba2CoTeO6 Introduction Perovskites ABO3 is one of the most important classes of functional materials and has also played a leading role in condensed matter physics When the B-site ions are magnetic and ordered the triangular lattice could be generated and the magnetic properties could be strongly influenced 1 Recently we studied the two-dimensional 2D triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TAF Ba3CoSb2O9 and observed several salient theoretically predicted features of a low-spin frustrated quantum magnet such as the strong downward renormalization of the magnon dispersion roton like minima flat modes near the Brillouin zone BZ boundary and the line broadening throughout the entire BZ However the LSW  1S approach is still not sufficient to quantitatively reproduce the quantum corrections to the low-energy spectrum Although the interlayer interaction in Ba3CoSb2O9 is only 5 the ground states of 120 deg phase at 0T and up-up-down phase from 98T to 15 T were interfered 3 To study the quantum effect thermal fluctuation and interlayer interaction effects on the 2D or quasi-2D TAF we want to check the dynamic spectra by changing the magnetic layer distance Hence we continue the work on another trigonal R -3mH and double-perovskite compound Ba2CoTeO6 in which Co2 ion also has an effective spin-12 This TAF compound exhibits strong frustration originated from both geometry and competing interactions In Ba2CoTeO6 the magnetic Co2 ions occupy bilayer triangular lattices Fig1 Since there is only one non-magnetic layer TeO5 between the Co-triangles the system should be more three dimensional and the inter-layer interaction should be stronger than Ba3CoSb2O9 In addition the magnetic properties of Ba2CoTeO6 present more complicated transitions than the 2D TAF system when the magnetic field is applied in c axis the bilayer triangular lattice shows three-step magnetic transitions with plateaus at M0 Ms3 and Ms2 before saturation instead of two transitions in Ba3CoSb2O9 M0 and Ms3 Such interesting phase transitions motivate us to systematically study the interplays of the quantum effect thermal fluctuation and Heisenberg superexchanges by measuring the spin-dynamics spectra of Ba2CoTeO6 by inelastic neutron scattering 5  Preliminary Work Based on the specific heat dielectric constant and AC susceptibility measurements on the single crystal sample not shown here we can construct a phase diagram under the magnetic field along c axis Fig 2a Below 16 K with increasing applied field four phases are observed The phase boundaries between phases I and II and phases II and III are related to the 13 Ms and 12 Ms spin flop transitions The single-crystal neutron diffraction has been performed at the four-circle diffractometer HB-3A Oak Ridge National Laboratory the R -3mH lattice structure has been confirmed by fitting the diffraction dataFig 2b And the magnetic wavevector is determined to be 012 -12 Experiment Plan We propose to use the Disk Chopper Spectrometer DCS to measure the temperature dependence of the magnetic spectra Comparing to the tri-perovskite A3CoM2O9 A Ba Sr and Ca M Nb and Sb two energy-bands would be observed at zero magnetic field below 16K the lower one is composed of one gapless mode and two gapped modes while the higher band would be generated by the quantum effect From the flux method 3g small single crystals sample in total has been synthesized and would be treated as powder to be loaded in Al-can Since the transition temperature is around 16K the orange cryostat is requested A series of temperatures would be applied from 15 to 20 K 15 5 10 and 20K each temperature would be measured around 10 hours Including the hours of sample cooling with the orange cryostat and the background measurements we estimate that 4 days of beam time will be necessary References  L Balents Nature London 464 199 2010  P W Anderson Mater Res Bull 8 153 1973  J Ma et al Phys Rev Lett 116 087201 2016  Y Kamiya et al Nat Comm 9 2666 2018  G Koutroulakis et al Phys Rev B 91 024410 2015  S A Ivanov et al Dalton Trans 39 5490 2010 Fig1 The lattice structure of Ba2CoTeO6 and the arrangement of bilayer triangular lattice of Co2 in the Ba2CoTeO6 a b Fig2 a The magnetic phase diagram for H  c-axis b The refinement result for the lattice structure of Ba2CoTeO6 based on HB3A data 0369121505101520253035IVIIIIIIBa2CoTeO6Hc Cp TN Cp TN2  TN  Hc1 Hc2 Hs M Hc1 Hc2 Hs Hc1 Hc2 H TT K
