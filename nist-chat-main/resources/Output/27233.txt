The binding of biliverdin to -lactoglobulin under high pressure Introduction and state of science The understanding of protein folding misfolding and unfolding is a key question in structural biology It is now very well known that applying high pressure HP results in the disruption of the protein native structure due to the decrease of the volume of the proteinsolvent system upon denaturation Pressure denaturation studies thus provide a fundamental thermodynamic parameter for protein unfolding ie the volume change V  Recent studies demonstrate that pressure mostly unfolds proteins because of hydrophobic cavities present in the folded state that are eliminated in the unfolded states  Internal cavities are thus important structural features for proteins and sources of fluctuations between different conformational states which can be stabilized by subsequent ligand binding Among globular proteins -lactoglobulin BLG the major whey protein highlights a hydrophobic cavity with strong ability to bind various ligands as well as a high propensity towards unfolding under HP  Therefore from a fundamental point of view BLG represents a relevant model system to study the effects of ligand binding on protein stability under HP From the point of view of health and food sciences BLG is one of the most common allergens in milk and it is temperature sensitive Alternative processing methods to Pasteurization involve the use of HP at lower temperatures where it is essential to understand the processes involved It has been shown that HP induces BLG aggregation at neutral pH that strongly depends on the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds through SHS-S interchange reactions  Our previous in situ HP-SANS results showed that binding of non-covalent ligands retinol and resveratrol stabilizes BLG but without significantly preventing HP induced BLG covalent aggregation Minic et al manuscript in preparation Biliverdin BV is a tetrapyrrole chromophore with propensity towards covalent binding to free cysteine Cys residues of proteins  Taking into account the high reactivity of free SH group within BLG BV is a good candidate for covalent binding and concomitant inhibition of BLG aggregation by HP as we recently reported for phycocynobilin another tetrapyrrole pigment highlighting large structural similarity with BV  Interestingly besides its potential for covalent binding to proteins BV could also be reversibly bound to the hydrophobic pocket of some proteins  Previous results Our preliminary HP-SANS measurements showed that HP at 3000 bars induces irreversible changes of BLG with a large increase of both Rg from 21 to 45  and I0 from 038 to 119 cm-1 as a consequence of BLG unfolding and covalent oligomerization Fig 1 Moreover measurements revealed that BV strongly reduces both Rg and I0 increase to 32  and 055 cm-1 respectively Fig 1 that could be explained by a covalent binding of BV with BLG Cys free residues Moreover SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed the ability of BLG to covalently bind BV Zn2 ions when bound to BV induce its fluorescence by UV illumination that can be observed at the position of BLG monomer band meaning that BV is bound to the protein and the BLG-BV covalent complex is well preserved after HP treatment Fig 1 Moreover while the monomer BLG band mostly diminishes after HP treatment due to BLG covalent oligomerization the presence of BV significantly preserves the monomer band intensity Fig 1 Coomassie brilliant blue CBB staining Interestingly HP UV-VIS absorption spectrophotometry of BLG-BV mixture showed that HP induces a red shift to higher wavelengths of near-UV and visible bands in BV spectrum Fig 2 as reported before for apomyoglobin-BV complex at atmospheric pressure  Therefore it seems that HP influences the binding of BV to BLG by remodeling the protein binding site which could induce conformational changes of BV itself However this shift is mostly reversible but not completely Fig 2 upon decreasing the pressure to 1 bar 001011E-41E-3001011 BLG Before HP BLG_BV Before HP BLG After HP BLG_BV After HPIntensityQ 18 gLpD 72Quartz cell Figure 1 Left SANS

BLG does not absorb it this spectral region Objectives and experimental method We will measure by in situ HP-SANS the aggregation and conformational changes of BLG to compare with ligand behavior We will investigate the conformations adopted by BLG under pressure from 1 to 3000 bars in the native apo-state and in the presence of ligand BV We would like to determine if BV binding could stabilize BLG structure and prevents its aggregation The comparison will allow us to better understand the role of BV binding on the pressure stability of proteins We will measure all samples at the 3 configurations of the 30 m instruments at the NCNR no lenses to access a large Q-range 0003-05 -1 using the NCNR HP-SANS system BLG is purified as previously described by Fox et al  and perdeuterated BLG is scheduled to be produced next December to the Bio-isotope Labelling Laboratory BL2 Perdeuterated protein is needed in order maximize the contrast the measurements will be carried out in H2O buffers and keep protein concentration as low as possible because of low ligand solubility This protein is monodisperse and very stable at room temperature and pressure For our first measurements with the HP-SANS system of the NCNR we want to measure a BLG solution at 5 mgmL concentration in Tris buffer pH 72 and 82 with and without BV 11 at pH 72 and 11 and 14 proteinligand ratios at pH 82 at room temperature and different pressure levels 1 1000 2000 3000 bars and 1 bar again after decreasing the pressure In order to solubilize BV each sample should contain 5 DMSO Buffer-only will be used to subtract the contributions of the buffer to scattering Considering about 90 minmeasurements for the whole Q-range per sample and 30 min for equilibration time for each pressure point the beam time required is 6 samples5 pressures 120 min  3000 min  60 h Taking into consideration background measurements empty beam empty cell background as well as half a day to install the pressure device and for cleaning and sample loadingunloading we request 4 days of beamtime for these measurements Technical justification A HP cell using metallic windows developed at the Laboratoire Lon-Brillouin LLB France  provides a rather stable HP without leakage but its application is limited to a Q-range between 002 and 02 -1 which limits both the accuracy of incoherent scattering subtraction and the ability to monitor oligomerization andor aggregation The HP system available at the NCNR presents several unique advantages for protein studies 1 It affords measurements at a wider Q-range between 00015 to 05 -1 and a broad range of temperatures The low Q-range will be used to monitor the effects of BV covalent binding on the formation of aggregates or oligomers under HP ii in the middle and high Q-ranges we will monitor the ability of BV to induce conformational changes of BLG at HP conditions Temperature control is critical given the sensitivity of the protein The higher q range accessible at neutron wavelengths of 45  as recently tested at the NCNR improves incoherent background subtraction from the use of H2O buffers Finally X-rays cannot be used at the time-scales we require equilibrium between the different molecular populations under pressure can take can take up to 30mins for BLG and HP-SAXS systems currently available flow systems operating at several kbar are still challenging are limited by fast radiation damage seconds typically Reference measurements The samples will be also measured in standard SANS cells under room pressure and temperature conditions a fully unfolded BLG in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride one sample b native BLG in the presence and absence of ligands as well as the buffer 7 samples BLG after HP treatment in the presence and the absence of ligand 5 samples We will use the full Q-range available at the 30 m instruments at the NCNR including Lenses to monitor the presence of any larger aggregates 0001-07 -1 This takes 12120 min  1440 min  24 h so we request 1 more day of beamtime for these reference measurements References  C A Royer BBA 1595 2002 p201-209 Revisiting volume changes in pressure-induced protein unfolding  J Roche et al PNAS 109
