ABSTRACT: The emergence of complex new ground states at interfaces has been identiﬁed as one of the most promising
routes to highly tunable nanoscale materials. Despite recent progress, isolating and controlling the underlying mechanisms
behind these emergent properties remains among the most challenging materials physics problems to date. In particular,
generating ferromagnetism localized at the interface of two nonferromagnetic materials is of fundamental and technological
interest. Moreover, the ability to turn the ferromagnetism on and oﬀwould shed light on the origin of such emergent phenomena
and is promising for spintronic applications. We demonstrate that ferromagnetism conﬁned within one unit cell at the interface of
CaRuO3 and CaMnO3 can be switched on and oﬀby changing the symmetry of the oxygen octahedra connectivity at the boundary.
Interfaces that are symmetry-matched across the boundary exhibit interfacial CaMnO3 ferromagnetism while the ferromagnetism
at symmetry-mismatched interfaces is suppressed. We attribute the suppression of ferromagnetic order to a reduction in charge
transfer at symmetry-mismatched interfaces, where frustrated bonding weakens the orbital overlap. Thus, interfacial symmetry is a
new route to control emergent ferromagnetism in materials such as CaMnO3 that exhibit antiferromagnetism in bulk form.

he discovery of novel electronic and magnetic ground states
in ABO3 perovskite oxide heterostructures has been made
possible through control of thin ﬁlm synthesis at nanometer
length scales.1−7 Discontinuities in band structure, valence states,
or interaction lengths at interfaces give rise to novel behavior
conﬁned near the interface. More recently, systematic tuning
of the atomic structure by manipulating BO6 octahedral con-
nectivity has opened up new pathways for generating emergent
phenomena in perovskite heterostructures.8,9 The manipulation
of octahedral connectivity can be achieved through epitaxial
strain, superlattice periodicity modulation, and crystallographic
symmetry (mis)match at the interfaces. For example, ferroelec-
tricity has been predicted in perovskite superlattices where neither
constituent material is ferroelectric.9,10 In ferromagnetic systems
such as La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/Eu0.7Sr0.3MnO3, LaMnO3/SrTiO3, or
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, the magnetic properties are tunable through
interfacial MnO6 octahedral tilt and rotation.11−14
Although octahedral connectivity control is typically used analo-
gously to strain and pressure application,11−14 emergent magnetic
interfaces present opportunities to realize eﬀects of octahedral
connectivity that truly have no bulk analog. In a system with pure

interfacial ferromagnetism, such as LaMnO3 or CaMnO3-based
superlattices, the impact of these structural variations may be
ampliﬁed to produce large changes in the magnetism.3,4,15−20
Even more dramatically, completely switching the interfacial
ferromagnetic order on and oﬀmay be possible.
CaRuO3/CaMnO3 is an ideal model system composed of an
antiferromagnetic insulator (CaMnO3) and a paramagnetic
metal (CaRuO3) where emergent interfacial ferromagnetism
has been investigated.4,5,19−22 Nanda et al. attributed the ferro-
magnetism to double exchange interactions among interfacial
Mn ions mediated by itinerant electrons transferred from the
adjacent CaRuO3.20 This charge transfer has been observed
through electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density func-
tional theory calculations show that competition between anti-
ferromagnetic superexchange and ferromagnetic double exchange
stabilizes a canted ferromagnetic state with a magnetization of
0.85−1.0 μB/Mn within the ﬁrst unit cell.19,20
In this Letter, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the ability to
switch emergent ferromagnetism on and oﬀthrough control
of octahedral connectivity. More speciﬁcally, crystallographic
symmetry-mismatch across the interfaces, associated with incom-
mensurate tilt and rotation of the MnO6 and RuO6 octahedra,
can modulate and even entirely suppress the interfacial ferro-
magnetism residing within a single unit cell of the CaMnO3 layer.
Our results indicate that the creation of discontinuities in the
interfacial structural symmetry inhibits electron transfer from
CaRuO3 to CaMnO3, destabilizing the ferromagnetism and illus-
trating the power of controlling charge transfer at interfaces.
We systematically probed the magnetic and atomic structure
of ((CaRuO3)n/(CaMnO3)m)10 superlattices, designated (n/m),
grown on (001) oriented SrTiO3 across the range n = 2−4 and
m = 3−19.19 In bulk, both materials are isostructural and possess
orthorhombic unit cells with Pbnm symmetry doubling the
pseudocubic perovskite unit cell.23,24 Unless otherwise noted, we
refer to the CaRuO3 and CaMnO3 pseudocubic structure and
lattice parameters of 0.386 and 0.373 nm, respectively. Ref-
erences to the orthorhombic system are designated with a sub-
scripted O.
X-ray reﬂectivity (XRR) and polarized neutron reﬂectometry
(PNR) (Figure 1) reveal uniform superlattices, individual layers
within 0.7% of designed thicknesses, and interfacial roughnesses
of 0.5 nm. These techniques probe several nonlocal sources of
roughness, such as long-range thickness variation. Locally, even
smoother interfaces are expected, which is in agreement with our
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measure-
ments.19
Having established structural quality, we probed the magnetic
depth proﬁle using PNR measurements of (3/10), (3/11),
(3/17), (3/18), and (4/19) superlattices using the PBR beamline
at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). Figure 1b
shows neutron spin-up and spin-down reﬂectivities for the
(3/17) superlattice along with the reﬂectivity calculated from a
model (Figure 1c) composed of 10 uniform stacked layers of
CaRuO3 and CaMnO3 with a single unit cell of ferromagnetic
CaMnO3 at each interface.22,25 The spin-splitting near the critical
edge and ﬁrst Bragg peak is sensitive to the magnitude of the
magnetization and is consistent with SQUID magnetometry.
In contrast, the second order peak provides sensitivity to
ferromagnetic layer thickness, illustrated in Figure 1d. Models of
the (3/17) superlattice with ferromagnetic layer thicknesses of
1, 2, and 3 unit cells predict a 28%, −1%, and −26% splitting
between spin-up and spin-down reﬂectivities at the second order
Bragg peak, respectively. The observed second order Bragg peak
splitting for the (3/17) sample is 46(±26)%, favoring a single
unit cell of ferromagnetism. Similar results are obtained for the
(3/18) and (4/19) samples. Together, all results give greater
than a 99.4% conﬁdence that the ferromagnetic layer is conﬁned
to a single unit cell of CaMnO3 at the interface and conclusively
rule out thicknesses exceeding 2 unit cells.
SQUID magnetometry (Figure 2a) indicates the coexistence
of interfacial ferromagnetic and interior antiferromagnetic
CaMnO3 layers, through the shift of the magnetization loops
after cooling in ±5 T. The shift is a manifestation of exchange
bias that results from exchange coupling between the ferro-
magnetic and adjacent antiferromagnetic layer. Exchange bias is
observed below 70 K for all periodicities and increases linearly
with CaMnO3 thickness throughout the measured range.19,22
Figure 2a also shows the typical temperature dependence of
the magnetization revealing a TC of 100(3) K for the interfacial
ferromagnetic CaMnO3 layers. Plotting saturation magnetization

(MSat) for (3/m) as a function of CaMnO3 thickness (Figure 2b),
reveals a modulation from 0.5 to 1.0 μB/Mn (normalized by the
number of interfacial Mn sites) with CaMnO3 layer thickness.
Once m ≥12, MSat of all samples converges to 1.0 μB/Mn.
Element speciﬁc magnetic characterization using X-ray absorp-
tion (XA) and XMCD in total electron yield (TEY) mode were
performed at beamlines 6.3.1 and 4.0.2 of the Advanced Light
Source and are shown in Figure 2c. They conﬁrmed the magne-
tometry measurements, that is, superlattices with “m = even”
number of CaMnO3 layers exhibit signiﬁcantly larger dichroism
on the Mn L3,2 absorption edge than superlattices with “m = odd”
number of CaMnO3 layers.
The variation in MSat for m < 12 (Figure 2b) is commensurate
with the periodicity of the orthorhombically distorted perovskite
unit cell−double that of the pseudocubic unit cell. That is,
superlattices with an even number of pseudocubic CaMnO3 unit
cells per layer (m = even) exhibit signiﬁcantly larger magnet-
ization than “m = odd” superlattices. Thus, to understand the
underlying mechanism behind the MSat modulation with CaMnO3
layer thickness, we performed detailed structural studies of the
interfaces using X-ray diﬀraction at beamline 7−2 of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.
The orthorhombic distortion symmetry may have either out-
of-phase or in-phase rotations of the oxygen octahedra when
viewed along the growth axis, giving rise to [110]O (Figure 3a)
and [001]O (Figure 3b) oriented orthorhombic domains, respec-
tively. The alignment of the [110]O or [001]O directions along
the growth axis is indicated by the presence of the (210)O or
(203)O diﬀraction peaks, corresponding to (01
2
3
2) and (113
2)
peaks, respectively. The presence or absence of these two peaks
enables identiﬁcation of the orthorhombic domains present in
our superlattices.22 Figure 3c−f shows the relative intensities of
the (01
2
3
2) and (113
2) peaks for a representative subset of super-
lattices with m < 6. All possible superlattice periodicity combi-
nations, (even/even), (odd/even), (even/odd), and (odd/odd),
were studied. We ﬁnd that (even/even) superlattices are [110]O
out-of-plane dominant while (odd/even) superlattices are [001]O
out-of-plane dominant. Superlattices with (even/odd) and
(odd/odd) are in a mixed state, with moderate intensities in
both (01
2
3
2) and (113
2) peaks. Examining the entire thickness
range revealed that the (01
2
3
2) intensity grows rapidly with
increasing CaMnO3 thickness, implying that the bulk of the
CaMnO3 is [110]O oriented. In contrast, the (113
2) peak does not
scale with CaMnO3 thickness, suggesting sensitivity to changes
in domain orientation near the interfaces.22
Figure 4 shows the dependence of MSat on the (113
2) peak
intensity (probing domains in the [001]O orientation). All samples
collapse onto a universal curve in which a moderate (113
2) peak
intensity is associated with a sharp reduction in magnetization.
Further, after accounting for the aforementioned (01

dependence on CaMnO3 thickness, we ﬁnd that the (01

is most intense for (even/even) samples, modest in (odd/odd)
and (even/odd) samples, and smallest for (odd/even) samples.22
Thus, a mixture of [001]O and [110]O domains at the interface
results in lower magnetization while the presence of a dominant
domain orientation (either [001]O or [110]O domains) at the
interface results in higher magnetization.
Mixed domain states occur only in superlattices with an odd
number of pseudocubic CaMnO3 unit cells per layer and may be
indicative of one of several structural conﬁgurations: crystallo-
graphic symmetry-mismatch across all interfaces, crystallo-
graphic symmetry-mismatch across every other interface, or
crystallographic symmetry-matched interfaces with equal pop-
ulations of the two orthorhombic domain types. However,
symmetry-matched interfaces would not diﬀerentiate samples
with even and odd CaMnO3 layers with respect to magnetization.
If the reduced magnetization results from interfacial symmetry-
mismatch, then the sharp switching of magnetization between
(n/m) and (n/m + 1) samples can be explained in terms of com-
plete suppression of ferromagnetism through symmetry-mis-
match at half of the interfaces. For this conﬁguration, in which
ferromagnetism is suppressed at half of the interfaces, the depth
dependence of our XMCD results requires that CaMnO3/CaRuO3
be the nonmagnetic interface while the CaRuO3/ CaMnO3 inter-
face is magnetic.22 This interpretation is consistent with SQUID
magnetometry, PNR, and XMCD data.
For superlattices with an even number of pseudocubic
CaMnO3 unit cells per layer, there is a dominant orthorhombic
domain orientation and each interface is symmetry-matched.
With interfacial symmetry matching, we expect strong interfacial
bonding that enables charge transfer and emergent ferromag-
netism. Therefore, although the two cases do not have the same
symmetry, both (even/even) and (odd/even) superlattices exhibit
higher magnetization. Speciﬁcally, (even/even) superlattices exhibit
majority [110]O domains regardless of CaRuO3 layer thickness,
while (odd/even) superlattices are majority [001]O. This suggests
that the structural distortions in CaRuO3 and its surface termi-
nation play a role in determining the emergent ferromagnetic
behavior.
The observed correlation between orthorhombic growth
domains and MSat demonstrates that interfacial ferromagnetism
can be tuned eﬀectively through lattice distortions and interfacial
crystallographic symmetry (mis)match. We propose that this
symmetry-mismatch occurs at half of the interfaces in super-
lattices with an odd number of CaMnO3 unit cells per super-
lattice layer, altering the Ru−O−Mn bonding ina way that reduces
orbital overlap. We postulate that the symmetry-mismatch and
reduced orbital overlap suppresses electron transfer at half the
interfaces, stabilizing purely antiferromagnetic interactions and
reducing the overall ferromagnetic moment.22 Thus, modiﬁca-
tion of the superlattice periodicity by only a single unit cell dra-
matically changes both the interfacial symmetry and the resultant
magnetic order.
In summary, we have demonstrated that interfacial ferromag-
netism can be tuned and even suppressed through interfacial
crystallographic symmetry-mismatch. Although octahedral tilt-
ing and rotations are typically secondary eﬀects, in the present
case the extreme sensitivity of the interfacial ferromagnetism
to modiﬁcation of the electron transfer enables the octahedral
superstructure to play a major role. In contrast to past examples
that were complicated by strain and thickness variation, the fully
interfacial nature of the magnetism in isostructural CaRuO3/
CaMnO3 superlattices along with the oscillatory thickness depen-
dence provides a truly unambiguous demonstration of the power
of octahedral connectivity on the magnetic ground state. These
observations unveil new approaches toward designing emergent
magnetic order and reveal a system in which there is a delicate
balance of exchange interactions that result in abrupt switching
between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. Although
further theoretical investigation is warranted, it is clear that
octahedral connectivity plays a critical role in tuning magnetism
at the nanometer length scale. Such tunability is promising
for future incorporation of these oxide interface systems into
spintronic applications.
