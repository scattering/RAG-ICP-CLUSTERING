A magnetostructural phase transition is investigated in single-crystal chromium nitride (CrN) thin ﬁlms grown
by rf plasma molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) substrates. While still within the vacuum environment
following molecular beam epitaxy growth, in situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, and in situ
variable low-temperature reﬂection high-energy electron diffraction are applied, revealing an atomically smooth
and metallic CrN(001) surface, and an in-plane structural transition from 1×1 (primitive CrN unit cell) to

2 −R45◦with a transition temperature of (278 ± 3) K, respectively. Ex situ temperature-dependent
measurements using neutron diffraction are also performed, looking at the structural peaks and likewise revealing a
ﬁrst-order structural transition along the [111] out-of-plane direction, with transition temperatures of (268 ± 3) K.
Turning to the magnetic peaks, neutron diffraction conﬁrms a clear magnetic transition from paramagnetic at
room temperature to antiferromagnetic at low temperatures with a sharp, ﬁrst-order phase transition and a Néel
temperature of (270 ± 2) K or (280 ± 2) K for two different ﬁlms. In addition to the experimental measurements
of structural and magnetic ordering, we also discuss results from ﬁrst-principles theoretical calculations which
explore various possible magnetostructural models.

I. INTRODUCTION
Although originally known for its impressive physical
properties including high hardness and corrosion resistance
[1,2], chromium nitride (CrN) has attracted considerable
attention in recent years due to its potential use as an
electronic or spintronic material resulting from observed
semiconducting-like behavior over a variety of temperatures
[3], and its antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures
[4]. Aside from potential electronic applications, CrN could
be a model system for studying ﬁrst-order phase transitions
in which structural, electronic, and magnetic properties are
intertwined.
The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CrN
were originally understood based only on results from bulk
powder samples [5,6]. For example, it was known since
1960 that bulk CrN is paramagnetic (PM) with a rock-salt
crystal structure at room temperature (RT), but becomes
antiferromagnetic (AFM) at low temperature (LT), with a
Néel temperature TN of 273–283 K and with an orthorhombic
crystal structure [5,7]. Then, Filippetti et al. proposed in 2000
that magnetic stress is the driving force for the structural
transition [8], thus linking the magnetic with the structural.
While the properties of CrN seemed quite well understood
for bulk material by 2000, since then various groups have
reported highly discrepant properties for CrN in thin-ﬁlm
form. For example, Gall et al. reported that CrN thin ﬁlms
grown on MgO(001) by reactive magnetron sputtering, due
to epitaxial constraints, do not exhibit a structural transition
*smitha2@ohio.edu
and that the resistivity varies by orders of magnitude, in-
creasing with decreasing temperature [3]. Whereas in 2004,
Constantin et al. found, instead, semiconducting behavior at
room temperature but a clear transition to metallic behavior at
low temperature for CrN thin ﬁlms grown by radio-frequency
nitrogen plasma molecular beam epitaxy (rf N-plasma MBE);
however, Constantin et al. did not address the presence or
absence of either structural or magnetic transitions in their
ﬁlms [9].
In 2011, Zhang et al. reported the absence of a struc-
tural transition for single-crystal CrN thin ﬁlms grown on
MgO(001) and MgO(111) substrates by sputtering, but they
did observe a transition for a polycrystalline CrN ﬁlm
grown on quartz [10]. Yet again, Inumaru et al. studied
CrN/MgO(001) and CrN/sapphire(0001) thin ﬁlms grown by
pulsed laser deposition, and while they did observe a structural
transition for CrN/MgO(001), they did not for the case of
CrN/sapphire(0001) [11].
Ney et al. investigated the magnetic properties of CrN
thin ﬁlms grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on
two different substrates: MgO(001) and sapphire(0001). They
reported that CrN/MgO(001) showed no magnetic transition
from PM to AFM upon cooling, although CrN/sapphire(0001)
showed ferromagnetic-like behavior at low temperatures [12].
Herwadkar and Lambrecht’s 2009 paper examined and
attempted to address some of the discrepant reports by means
of electronic structure calculations using the local spin density
approximation including Hubbard correction (LSDA + U)
applied to the Corliss AFM model (referred to as AFM-[110]2)
as well as some competing models. They proposed possible
reasons for the widely differing transport properties reported,
and the observation or lack thereof, of structural/magnetic

phase transitions suggesting, for example, that the various
properties could be strongly affected by the presence/absence
of N vacancies and possible localization effects [13].
In this paper, we apply variable temperature reﬂection
high-energy electron diffraction (VT-RHEED) and variable
temperature neutron diffraction (VT-ND) to investigate a
possible structural phase transition, and VT-ND to investigate
a possible magnetic phase transition in CrN thin ﬁlms grown
using rf N-plasma MBE. The experimental results may
be compared to, and are consistent with, the temperature-
dependent resistivity results reported by Constantin et al.
in 2004 [9]. We also carry out ﬁrst-principles theoretical
calculations for CrN using several different computational
methods in order to investigate structural and magnetic models
which are consistent with our experimental results. Although
we will show that the measurements do not uniquely support
one particular structural model, the structural phase transition
is very clear, both for the in-plane as well as out-of-plane
measurements. On the other hand, we will also show that the
magnetic measurements uniquely support the magnetic model
(AFM-[110]2) put forth by Corliss et al. in 1960 [5]. We also
ﬁnd that sample stoichiometry (nitrogen deﬁciency) appears
to affect the transition temperature slightly.
II. METHODS
Growth and VT-RHEED experiments are performed in a
custom designed ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system combining
MBE with low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy
(LT-STM), which makes excellent conditions for in situ
characterization of as-grown thin ﬁlms [14,15]. High-quality
CrN thin ﬁlms are grown on MgO(001) substrates initially
cleaned ex situ with acetone followed by isopropyl alcohol
and further prepared in vacuum by heating up to 1000 ◦C ±
30 ◦C (one sigma error on substrate temperature is deﬁned by
the machine precision) while being exposed to nitrogen plasma
ﬂux until a streaky RHEED pattern is obtained.
All four samples (ﬁlm thicknesses in parentheses), S45
(670 nm), S61 (980 nm), S73 (150 nm), and S75 (37 nm),
investigated in this experiment were grown at a substrate
temperature of 650 ◦C ± 30 ◦C. Chromium ﬂux values for
S45 and S61 were 2.3×1014 Cr atoms/cm2/s and 2.1×1014
Cr atoms/cm2/s, respectively. The nitrogen ﬂux, based on
separate measurements of the Ga-rich/N-rich crossover point
for smooth GaN MBE growth done in the same chamber, was
determined to be 3.3×1014 N atoms/cm2/s using a SVTA
plasma source operating at 450 W forward power and a
chamber pressure of 2×10−5 Torr. Therefore, for S45 and
S61, we get N:Cr ﬂux ratios of 1.43:1 and 1.57:1, respectively.
In order to maintain streaky, single-phase growth, growth
interrupts were occasionally applied during the growth by
closing the Cr and N plasma shutters for periods ranging from
1 to 120 min. The total deposition time for S45 was 273 min
and for S61 was 428 min, corresponding to growth rates of
147 and 138 nm/hour, respectively.
Samples S73 and S75 were grown with similar sub-
strate temperatures but much lower Cr ﬂux values of
5.8×1013 Cr atoms/cm2/s and 5.2×1013 Cr atoms/cm2/s,
respectively. Furthermore, for these two samples, the N plasma
power was reduced to 275 Watts forward power, and therefore
we can assume a reduction of N ﬂux by approximately 39%
to a value of 2.0×1014 N atoms/cm2/s, resulting in N:Cr ﬂux
ratios of 3.3:1 and 3.9:1 for S73 and S75, respectively. Growth
deposition times for S73 and S75 were 243 and 67 min,
resulting in growth rates of 36 and 33 nm/hour, respectively.
Chromium nitride samples are further studied to optimize
growth conditions for high-quality ﬁlms using a wide variety
of surface- and bulk-sensitive techniques including LT-STM,
Rutherford backscattering spectrometery (RBS), and x-ray
diffraction (XRD).
A possible in-plane structural transition is studied in situ
in CrN samples S73 and S75 using VT-RHEED. The VT-
RHEED setup consists of a custom designed VT sample
stage, which can be heated up to 1273 K and cooled down
to 193 K and a RHEED system for continuously monitoring
surfaces. We used liquid nitrogen to cool down the samples
while observing changes in the surfaces with a 20-keV e
beam. The experiments are performed one at a time for four
crystallographic directions: [100], [110], [130], and [120],
and the patterns are recorded above and below the transition
temperature.
We performed variable temperature neutron diffraction
(VT-ND) experiments at the NIST Center for Neutron
Research (NCNR). Neutron diffraction measurements were
performed to study the magnetic and structural transitions in
S45 and S61 using the BT-4 triple-axis spectrometer with
neutrons of incident energy 14.7 meV (corresponding to
wavelength 2.359 ˚A) for the magnetic reﬂections and 30.5 meV
(corresponding to wavelength 1.638 ˚A) for the structural
reﬂections. Energies were selected with a pyrolitic graphite
monochromator and analyzer, and also pyrolitic graphite ﬁlters
were placed in the beam to remove contamination from
higher-order wavelengths. To maximize signal intensity, 40′
collimations were used before and after the sample with open
collimation before the monochromator and after the analyzer.
Collimation settings for both neutron diffraction experiments
were the same. Samples were mounted on single-crystal
silicon wafers with ﬂuorinated grease and sealed with He
atmosphere inside an aluminum can for temperature control via
a closed-cycle refrigerator. In addition to the BT-4 triple-axis
spectrometer data presented in this paper, polarized neutron
beam experiments were also performed using the BT-7 triple-
axis spectrometer with 14.7-meV neutrons and 3He neutron
spin ﬁlters [16,17].
Table I presents the four samples, their thicknesses, and the
various experimental techniques which were applied to each.
Not all techniques were (or could be) applied to all samples.
VT-ND, for example, requires thicker samples to get sufﬁcient
signal to noise.
Calculations have been done within the periodic density
functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the PWSCF code of
the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package [18]. Exchange-correlation
energies are modeled using three different approximations:
the local density approximation with the Perdew-Zunger (PZ)
parametrization [19] plus Hubbard correction (LDA + U) [20]
with 3 eV ⩽U ⩽5 eV employing the simpliﬁed version
of Cococcioni [21]; the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) as stated by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) gradi-
ent corrected functional [22] and the GGA-PBE functional plus
Hubbard correction (GGA + U) with 1 eV ⩽U ⩽5 eV using

the Cococcioni simpliﬁed version [21]. In all cases, Vanderbilt
ultrasoft pseudopotentials [23] have been employed to replace
the core electrons. The cutoff energy to truncate the electronic
states expansion in plane waves has been optimized, ﬁnding
a cutoff of 30 Ry to be appropriate. For the charge density,
we have used a density cutoff of 240 Ry. Convergence was
achieved when the forces acting on each ion were smaller
than 0.002 eV/ ˚A, and the energy difference between two
consecutive steps was less than 0.01 eV. Moreover, Brillouin
zone integration has been done using a Methfessel-Paxton [24]
smearing of 0.01 Ry and an optimized and equally spaced k
points mesh of 5×5×5 [25] centered at Gamma.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Growth and in situ sample characterization
Shown in Fig. 1(a) is a characteristic RHEED pattern of
CrN, which is taken along [110] at the end of the growth of
S45 at room temperature. Five sharp and continuous streaks
in the zeroth-order Laue ring (Z[110]) corresponding to the
cubic symmetry of CrN are visible in this pattern. The streak
spacing corresponds to an in-plane lattice constant (a∥) of
4.14 ˚A, which shows that this sample is more relaxed than
the Constantin et al. samples (4.04–4.13 ˚A) and matches the
Ney et al. sample (4.14 ˚A) and can be taken as the bulk value
[9,12]. The bulk lattice parameter of MgO is 4.213 ˚A [26].
A 38 nm×42 nm LT-STM image of S45 taken at 4.2 K is
presented in Fig. 1(b). Five atomically smooth terraces with
consistent contrast are visible in the image. In order to ﬁnd the
out-of-plane lattice constant (a⊥), a line proﬁle is taken across
three terraces in the STM image as shown in Fig. 1(c). The
step height of each terrace is 2.07 ˚A, which is half of the a⊥
of CrN.
Since the image was acquired at sample bias +1.0 V and
tunnel current 0.5 pA, the surface is conductive. Furthermore,
other images of the same surface acquired at +0.1 V and
0.5 pA strongly support that this surface is metallic at low
temperature. This is further conﬁrmed by dI/dV spectroscopy
data acquired at low temperature.
The absence, or presence, of long-range-topographic dis-
tortions (LTDs) at nitride surfaces has been associated with
metallic, or semiconducting, surface conductivity behavior.
For example, metal-rich wurtzite GaN surfaces and metallic,
bulklike manganese nitride (010) and (001) surfaces do
not display LTD’s [27–29], whereas bulklike, stoichiometric
semiconducting ScN (001) surfaces do show LTD’s [30], as
does CrN (001) observed at room temperature [9]. For CrN
(001) at low temperature, we do not observe LTD’s, which is
consistent with the CrN (001) surface at low temperature being
metallic.
B. Ex situ sample characterization
Shown in Fig. 1(d) is an XRD pattern of S45, where 002
and 004 peaks of CrN and the same peaks of MgO can be seen.
Scattering of Kα1 x rays coming from the Cu target produce
the main peaks and Kα2 appears as a bulge on the side of the
MgO 002 peak and as a second peak on the right side of the
MgO 004 reﬂection. The XRD pattern is ﬁrst calibrated with
respect to the MgO substrate, and then the lattice parameter of
CrN is measured. The 002 peak of CrN occurs at 2θ = 43.56
◦
corresponding to a⊥= 4.15 ˚A, and it is in the range of the
previously reported values of 4.13–4.17 ˚A [5,9,12,31].
The CrN samples are characterized ex situ with RBS to ﬁnd
their stoichiometry as well as their thickness. Best ﬁt to the
FIG. 1. (a) Streaky RHEED pattern (for S45) recorded along
[110] showing zeroth-order Laue zone ring, corresponding to cubic
symmetry of CrN at room temperature. (b) LT-STM image taken at

S45) showing 002 and 004 peaks of MgO and CrN; although hardly

both Kα1 and Kα2 peaks, but these are not distinguished for CrN 004.

RBS data of S61 reveals a 7% N deﬁciency while S45 is found
to be ideally stoichiometric with Cr:N = 1.0:1.0. As measured
by RHEED and XRD, we do not see any secondary phases
in any samples; therefore, a N deﬁciency is attributed to N
vacancies in the sample. Since S61 was the thickest sample, it
received the greatest amount of growth interrupt and annealing
time, which may explain why it shows N deﬁciency. On the
other hand, S73 and S75 are very thin compared to S45 and
S61, and they were also grown with higher N:Cr ﬂux ratio.
Therefore, we expect these ﬁlms to be highly stoichiometric.
C. Observation of in-plane structural transition
using RHEED
A possible in-plane structural transition is studied in S73
and S75 using VT-RHEED. If the room-temperature fcc crystal
structure transforms into orthorhombic with a 2◦distortion,
then the RHEED patterns may be affected by the structural
changes. For example, if the entire CrN ﬁlm is distorted
coherently along [110], then the LT-RHEED patterns taken
along [100] and [010] should be misaligned with respect to
the RT-RHEED pattern, which should result in asymmetry of
the streak pattern. Alternatively, if half of the sample domains
of the ﬁlm are stretched along [110] and the other half along
[110], then one would expect to see split streaks or streak
broadening in RHEED patterns along [110] and [110]. Such
effects are not obvious in the RHEED patterns taken below TN.
On the other hand, we do observe new streaks/spots in
the RHEED patterns of S73 and S75 at ∼277 and ∼278 K,
respectively, upon cooling, as shown in Fig. 2. The relative
brightness of the new streaks/spots increases with further
decrease in the sample temperature while the overall patterns
stay the same. It is an abrupt transition with a transition
temperature of (278 ± 3) K (one sigma error on substrate
temperature is deﬁned by the estimated machine precision and
is more precise at low temperatures). As described in the fol-
lowing, the appearance of these additional streaks/spots below
the transition temperature corresponds to a transition from a
1×1 unit cell to a
√
2×
√
2 −R45◦unit cell (alternatively,
from a primitive 1×1 to a conventional 1×1 unit cell).
Shown in Fig. 2 are eight RHEED patterns of S73, where
patterns shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(c), 2(e), and 2(g) are recorded
above, and patterns shown in Figs. 2(b), 2(d), 2(f), and 2(h) are
recorded below, the phase transition. The patterns are further-
more grouped in columns as follows: [110] [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b);
[130] [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)]; [120] [Figs. 2(e) and 2(f)]; and
[100] [Figs. 2(g) and 2(h)]. These crystallographic directions
can be identiﬁed by their characteristic streak spacings. For
example, U is the streak spacing along [110]; and V , W, and
X are larger than U by
√
5,
√
10, and
√
2 times, respectively.
Unique streaks/spots in each RHEED pattern are marked with
Miller indices which correspond to the reciprocal space map
presented in Fig. 3(b).
When we compare Fig. 2(a) with Fig. 2(b), above the
transition only a zeroth-order Laue ring (Z[110]) is visible while
below the transition, in addition to Z[110], a ﬁrst-order Laue
ring (F[110]) appears. Additionally, one can notice two points:
ﬁrst, the spacing between F[110] streaks (U) is the same as for
Z[110]; however, each F[110] streak occupies a 1
2-order position
referenced to Z[110].
FIG. 2. RHEED patterns (a), (c), (e), and (g) are recorded above
and (b), (d), (f), and (h) are recorded below the transition temperature
for S73. Crystallographic direction of each pattern is given at the
bottom right corner, and temperatures are shown at bottom left corner.
Characteristic streak spacings along [110], [130], [120], and [100] are
represented by U, V , W, and X. Zeroth-, ﬁrst-, and second-order Laue
rings are represented by Z, F, and S. Streaks/spots seen at both high
and low temperature are labeled in yellow, while streaks/spots seen
only at low temperature are labeled in blue.
Similarly, in the case of [130], only zeroth-order and
second-order (S[130]) Laue rings are visible above the transi-
tion, and the streak spacing (V ) in both rings is the same. Below
the transition temperature, a ﬁrst-order Laue ring (F[130])
appears midway along the vertical between Z[130] and S[130],
but each spot of F[130] is laterally offset midway between the
adjacent streaks of Z[130] and S[130], another sign of the abrupt
transition.
The VT-RHEED experiments were also performed along
[120] and [100] directions, and in each case 1
2-order streaks
appear while cooling through the transition temperature as is
clear within the zeroth-order and ﬁrst-order Laue rings for
[120] and within the zeroth-order Laue ring for [100].
D. Model to explain the in-plane transition
seen in VT-RHEED
To understand the origin of the diffraction streaks/spots
seen in RHEED above and below the transition temperature,
a detailed model of the CrN surface is shown in Fig. 3. Using
this model, each RHEED streak/spot from the experimental

FIG. 3. (a) Direct lattice for CrN(001), all colored (both yellow and blue) balls represent Cr atoms in the primitive 1×1 structure
corresponding to fcc CrN at room temperature, whereas at low temperature a superperiodicity is observed indicated by only blue balls and

√
2 −R45◦unit cell relative to the 1×1 primitive cell. (b) Reciprocal lattice for CrN(001); only yellow spots are observed at

Zeroth-, ﬁrst-, and second-order Laue zones are represented by Z (solid lines), F (dashed lines), and S (dotted lines), respectively. All rods
corresponding to streaks/spots visible in the RHEED patterns are labeled in reciprocal space.
patterns can be precisely accounted for. The direct lattice is
shown in Fig. 3(a), and the corresponding reciprocal lattice
map is shown in Fig. 3(b).
The basic structure for CrN(001) surface above the tran-
sition can be viewed as just a primitive 1×1 square lattice
(yellow atom lattice, labeled with vectors ⃗b1 and ⃗b2 primitive
cell vectors) as shown in Fig. 3(a). Corresponding to this
1×1 primitive lattice in real space is the reciprocal space
two-dimensional (2D) square lattice (yellow spots) shown
in Fig. 3(b). This yellow spot reciprocal space map explains
all the spots seen in RHEED in all four azimuthal directions
([110], [130], [120], and [100]) above the transition.
The b1-b2 primitive lattice can also be viewed as a
conventional face-centered square lattice [unit vectors ⃗a1 and
⃗a2 shown in Fig. 3(a)] with an identical two-atom basis.
The new model below the transition can be attained simply
by lifting the degeneracy between corner and face-centered
atoms, leading to half yellow and half blue atoms seen in
the model. And then the corresponding reciprocal lattice
map consists of the previous set of (yellow) spots plus an
additional new set of (blue) spots seen in Fig. 3(b). These new
edge-center spots account for all the new spots seen in the LT-
RHEED patterns. Sets of reciprocal space points along certain
directions [indicated by straight lines in Fig. 3(b)] correspond
to particular Laue zones seen in the RHEED patterns. Every
Laue zone and every reciprocal space lattice point is labeled
in the ﬁgure in a manner consistent with markings in Fig. 2.
Based on the model shown in Fig. 3(a), appearance of the new
F[110] Laue ring along the [110] azimuth is associated with
the lifting of the degeneracy and corresponds to a periodicity
doubling (2×a∥/
√
2) along [110]. Similarly, the appearance of
the F[130] Laue zone spots for the [130] azimuth is associated
with the same degeneracy lifting as for [110] and corresponds
to an atomic periodicity doubling (2×
√
2.5 a∥) along [130].
Lastly, the appearance of the 1
2-order spots/streaks for [120]
and [100] is consistent with the degeneracy lifting shown in the
model of Fig. 3(a), and corresponds to a periodicity doubling
(2×a∥/
√
20) along [210] for the [120] azimuth and a doubling
(2×a∥/2) along [010] for the [100] azimuth.
We ﬁnd that the simple model having a cubic unit cell
fully explains the RHEED spots observed at LT; however, the
cause of this superperiodicity seen on the surface is unknown.
It may indicate a structural distortion. Since RHEED is not
spin sensitive, we cannot conclude anything about the spin
ordering at the surface, and we assume that it corresponds
to some kind of cooling-induced surface buckling or other
structural effect. It is possible, however, that the surface phase
transition corresponds to the bulk phase transition for two
reasons. First, the RT 1×1 surface structure is bulklike; and
second, the phase transition coincides pretty closely with the
one observed in neutron diffraction described below for bulk.
E. Investigation of the structural transition using VT-ND
To more accurately investigate the structural transition in
our CrN thin ﬁlms, we monitored three structural peaks (111,
002, and 220, indexed relative to the pseudocubic unit cell)
above and below the transition temperature using neutron
diffraction for S61. At room temperature, all of these three
peaks occur as small shoulders on the high-angle side of the
large 111, 002, and 220 MgO peaks since the MgO substrate
thickness is substantially greater than the CrN ﬁlm thickness.
Three θ−2θ scans through the 111 peak collected at 305,
270, and 240 K are shown in Fig. 4(a). From the 305 and
270 K curves, we ﬁnd that the position of the 111 MgO peak
at 2θ = 39.6◦, in comparison to the position 39.4◦expected

FIG. 4. (a) The CrN 111 peak (for S61), a shoulder of the MgO
111 peak, is clearly shifted from 2θ = 40.2◦at 305 and 270 K, to 40.6◦
at 240 K; (b) peak intensity at 40.5◦versus temperature while heating
showing a ﬁrst-order transition at (268 ± 3) K (one sigma error is
estimated for the midpoint of the transition region); (c) the CrN 002
peak (for S61), which should be located on the right shoulder of the
MgO 002 peak at 46.7◦, shows no signiﬁcant difference from 305 to
270 K, but at 240 K a slightly decreased intensity is observed; (d) the
CrN 220 peak (for S61), expected at 68.2◦, appears as a clear shoulder
of the MgO 220 peak, and no change in position is observed between
305 and 240 K. Note that the 240 K data were obtained in different
conditions with reduced shielding which gives rise to higher count
rates and greater background levels. For comparison purposes, the
intensity has been scaled such that the MgO peak intensity matches
that obtained in the 305 K scan. (Errors in intensity are deﬁned by the
standard deviation and scale with the square root of the intensity.)
for bulk MgO, does not change (note that the difference
between the measured and nominal MgO 2θ values is within
experimental error for the E = 30.5 meV neutrons that results
from the coarse resolution utilized to detect the small ﬁlm
reﬂections; uncertainties in the shift in the peak position with
temperature are signiﬁcantly smaller). At 305 and 270 K, a
clear shoulder is evident on the right side of the 111 MgO peak
near 2θ = 40.2◦, corresponding to a d spacing d111 = 2.38 ˚A,
consistent with RT CrN lattice constants a = b = c = 4.13 ˚A.
The center of the CrN shoulder at 240 K (as obtained
from Gaussian ﬁts), however, has shifted to a higher angle
of 40.6◦, corresponding to a LT CrN d spacing d111 = 2.36 ˚A.
These data clearly show that there is a sudden lattice distortion
(contraction) along the [111] axis of the pseudocubic cell,
which is tipped at an angle of 35◦relative to the ﬁlm growth
axis. These data are consistent with a bulklike orthorhombic
distortion of the CrN lattice in which the 111 peak at high
temperatures splits into 201 and 011 reﬂections (indexed
relative to the orthorhombic cell) at low temperatures. The
position of the shoulder at 240 K approximately matches that
expected for the bulk CrN 201 reﬂection (40.6◦), but the 011
orthorhombic reﬂection, if present, would be obscured by the
111 MgO reﬂection (near an angle of 39.7◦).
To determine if this structural transition is ﬁrst order, we
monitored the peak intensity at 2θ = 40.5◦as a continuous
function of temperature upon heating from 240 K after cooling
from room temperature. We see an abrupt change in intensity
at T = 268 ± 3 K, as shown in Fig. 4(b) (error of one sigma
is estimated for the midpoint of the transition region). The
transition spans a range of about 12 K, but the actual transition
could be sharper due to our ﬁnite-temperature equilibration
times (2.6 min per point).
Using VT-ND, we also investigated the temperature depen-
dence of the 002 peak, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Three curves
are shown, one above the transition (305 K), one near the
transition (270 K), and one below the transition (240 K). A
full orthorhombic distortion of the CrN (similar to what was
seen for bulk powders), if it occurred, would be expected
to produce only a subtle shift in the 002 peak position,
from (approximately) 2θ = 46.72◦at high temperatures to
2θ = 46.68◦at low temperatures. This tiny shift is below the
instrument resolution, and all that is seen at 240 K is a slightly
decreased intensity (compared to the 270 and 305 K data) on
the right side of the MgO 002 peak near the anticipated RT
CrN peak position.
To isolate any in-plane component of the lattice distortion,
we performed similar neutron diffraction measurements for the
220 peak, as shown in Fig. 4(d). In this case, the anticipated
RT CrN 220 peak for the curve taken at 305 K is at 68.2◦,
and a shoulder near this angle is seen well separated from the
MgO 220 peak (note that the ﬁtted position of the 220 MgO
peak is 2θ = 67.3◦, relative to the expected position 66.8◦for
bulk MgO). The 220 curve for 240 K [in Fig. 4(d)] also shows
a shoulder at the same angle. (Note that the 240 K data were
obtained in different conditions with reduced shielding.) This
indicates that the lattice constant along the [220] direction
does not shift as the sample is cooled. If a full bulklike,
orthorhombic distortion occurs within the ﬁlm plane, we would
expect a splitting of the 220 peak at high temperatures into 020,
212, and 400 reﬂections (indexed relative to the orthorhombic
cell) at low temperatures. The 020 (with an expected angle of
67.1◦) is obscured by the MgO substrate 220 reﬂection, and
the 212 (with an expected angle of 68.2◦) effectively coincides
with the 220 pseudocubic CrN reﬂection at high temperature.
At low temperature, we do not see any signiﬁcant increase in
scattering near the expected position of the 400 (69.4◦), though
any scattering may be masked by the instrument background,
which is larger due to instrument conﬁguration differences
(as noted above). So, therefore, we do not ﬁnd any deﬁnitive
evidence of a LT lattice distortion along the in-plane direction
for these CrN ﬁlms, though the neutron measurements cannot
rule out this possibility.
We therefore ﬁnd that a structural transition is observed for
CrN in the [111] out-of-plane direction by VT-ND, whereas
the results from VT-RHEED as well as VT-ND indicate that
an expected in-plane structural distortion at low temperatures
is suppressed. These data are consistent with (but not uniquely
supportive of) a reduction or clamping of the in-plane lattice
distortion at low temperatures due to the epitaxial constraints
from the rock-salt fcc MgO substrate. The VT-ND and
VT-RHEED results are consistent with a possible tetragonal-
type structure at low temperatures. In any case, a structural
transition is deﬁnitely observed within our ﬁlms.

F. Measuring the magnetic phase transition using VT-ND
Based on the work of Filippetti et al. [8], it is expected in
CrN that spin ordering drives structural distortion. Therefore,
we expect a connection between the observed structural
transition and a magnetic phase transition in our ﬁlms. Neutron
diffraction is the most accurate way to probe the onset
of long-range magnetic order, particularly in the case of
antiferromagnetism. Sample S45 (670 nm thick) was aligned
in the hhl zone, within the pseudocubic notation for the
high-temperature rock-salt structure. Both the 1

peaks, each related to the antiferromagnetic ordering of CrN,

2h directions, for Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively, are
well described by simple Gaussian line shapes when compared
to the ﬂat background at higher temperatures. The full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of each peak determined from
the ﬁt is within error of the calculated resolution limit for
each reﬂection, indicating extended correlation length and
long-range magnetic order over the entirety of the sample.
The temperature dependencies of the peak intensities of the

21 reﬂections are shown in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d), re-
spectively. The intensities of both reﬂections increase sharply
upon cooling, consistent with a ﬁrst-order phase transition.
The temperature dependencies below TN results from a small
temperature-dependent background apparent in Figs. 5(a)
and 5(b) rather than the sample itself. Polarized neutron beam
experiments furthermore conﬁrm that these peaks are magnetic
in origin. Therefore, from the temperature-dependent data, a
Néel temperature is determined by ﬁtting it with a simple order
parameter and linear background (solid line in the ﬁgure),
from which we ﬁnd TN = (280 ± 2) K (error is one sigma
uncertainty from the ﬁtting parameter). Similar measurements
of the 1
2
1
20 reﬂection for a thicker sample (S61, 980 nm and
having a 7% nitrogen deﬁciency) were also performed, ﬁnding
a ﬁrst-order transition at a lower TN [(270 ± 2) K] than
for S45.
The determined Néel temperature for stoichiometric S45
[(280 ± 2) K] is consistent with the structural transition
temperature determined from VT-RHEED measurements
[(278 ± 3) K], although those samples were much thinner
(S73/150 nm and S75/37 nm). Furthermore, the reduced
Néel temperature [(270 ± 2) K] for 7% nitrogen-deﬁcient
S61 matches the structural transition temperature obtained for
the same sample using VT-ND [(268 ± 3) K]. This indicates
a close correspondence between magnetic and structural

transitions in these CrN ﬁlms. In any case, it is clear that these
CrN ﬁlms exhibit both magnetic and structural transitions, and
over similar temperature ranges.
G. Theoretical calculations of cubic, tetragonal,
and orthorhombic models
When we compare our experimental results to the Corliss
model (AFM-[110]2), which was also investigated by Filippetti
et al. [5,8], as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), we ﬁnd excellent
agreement magnetically, but structurally the picture appears
more complicated. Certainly, the Corliss model with its
alternating double-layer ferromagnetic sheets (type 4 antifer-
romagnetism according to the Cox fcc classiﬁcation system)
gives rise to 1
2
1
20 and 1
2
1
21 magnetic peaks which we observed,
and yet the RHEED did not observe any in-plane distortion
expected for the orthorhombic model, consistent with the
VT-ND results which did not observe any changes in the 220
peak position after cooling the sample. On the other hand,
the 111 peak was observed to shift, exhibiting a ﬁrst-order
phase transition versus temperature. These results suggested
the possibility of other models which could explain the
magnetism while also giving a better agreement structurally.
For example, the LT-RHEED data suggest a square lattice
unit cell, and given the results from VT-ND, it would therefore
make sense to consider both cubic and tetragonal AFM models,
in addition to the AFM-[110]2 model. Two such models are
presented in Fig. 6(c) (AFM-cubic, type 1 AFM) and Fig. 6(e)
(AFM-tetragonal, type 3 AFM). Additional motivation to
consider other models comes from the theoretical work of
Zhou et al. who showed that the AFM-[110]2 model in bulk
CrN has lower total energy compared to the AFM-cubic model
by only 0.06 eV/atom or 0.04 eV/atom depending on the
particular method [32], which is not a big difference, and
therefore epitaxial constraints as well as strain in actual ﬁlms
could be enough to change the sign of the inequality.
We therefore performed numerical calculations for non-
magnetic, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic ordering in
the cases of cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic models using
GGA (generalized gradient approximation) and LDA + U
(local density approximation + Hubbard correction, with
3 eV ⩽U ⩽5 eV) [33]. Our models are divided into two
categories based on the number of monolayers (ML’s). The
models with <9 ML’s (surface) give a lattice constant of 4.140
˚A, whereas models with ⩾9 ML’s (bulk) are relatively relaxed
and give a lattice constant of 4.145 ˚A.
For the AFM-cubic model, both the surface and bulk
models show metallic behavior. Whereas the surface model
of the AFM-tetragonal shows metallic behavior, while the
bulk model shows semiconducting behavior with a band gap
of 0.03 eV. Similarly, for the AFM-[110]2 model, we ﬁnd
metallic behavior for the surface model but semiconducting
behavior with a band gap of 0.16 eV for the bulk model.
These ﬁndings are comparable to the results of Herwadkar
and Lambrecht who obtained a gap of 0.4 eV for U = 3 eV in
LSDA + U calculations [13] (see also Supplemental Material,
Fig. 3 [33]). The fact that our LT-STM data are consistent with
metallic behavior, which is also consistent with the results of
Constantin et al.’s LT resistivity measurements for similarly
grown samples [9], is therefore not obviously in the best
104433-8

STRUCTURAL AND MAGNETIC PHASE TRANSITIONS IN . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 96, 104433 (2017)
agreement with the existence of a ﬁnite gap as seen in the
AFM-[110]2 model, as compared to a zero-gap model such
as AFM-cubic. However, as discussed in detail by Herwadkar
and Lambrecht, this LT metallic behavior could arise from
exceeding a critical electron density owing to N vacancies
acting as donors.
We should emphasize here that for each model we began
our calculations from a perfect cubic structure and the models
were allowed to relax in all directions. The AFM-[110]2 model
shows a shear distortion similar to what was observed by
Corliss et al. and Filippetti et al. [5,8], while the AFM-cubic
model shows no distortion [shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d)],
and the AFM-tetragonal model [shown in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f)]
shows a contraction of 0.01855 ˚A in a⊥. The shear distortion
only occurs if we choose the Corliss (AFM-[110]2) magnetic
model (alternating double ferromagnetic layers).
Concerning the cubic (type 1 AFM) and tetragonal (type 3
AFM) models, these both have very similar spin ordering.
However, in the AFM-cubic model, single ferromagnetic
planes alternate along [010], while in the AFM-tetragonal
model, spin rows appear rotated by 90◦after every 1 ML
when viewed along [001] as shown in Fig. 6(e), and spin rows
in the layers stacked vertically along [001] shift by a/2 along
[100] after every 2 ML as shown in Fig. 6(f).
To determine the best model, we employed the minimum
energy criteria. Energies of the ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic
models are both higher than all the AFM models; therefore,
they are not shown in this paper. The energies of the
AFM-cubic and AFM-tetragonal compared to the AFM-[110]2
model are found to be 0.040 eV/atom higher (consistent with
the 0.04–0.05 eV/atom reported by Liangcai et al. [32]) and
0.023 eV/atom higher, respectively. Therefore, we conﬁrmed
that not only the AFM-cubic, but also the AFM-tetragonal
models are energetically less favorable compared to the AFM-
[110]2 model.
Most importantly, it must be realized that the observed 1
2
1
20
and 1
2
1
21 magnetic peaks seen in VT-ND at low temperature
are forbidden in the cases of both type 1 and type 3 fcc AFM
ordering. This can easily be realized if one simply considers
that for a 1
2-order magnetic peak to exist in reciprocal space, it
requires a spatial doubling of the magnetic unit cell. Such
a doubling occurs in the case of the type 4 AFM-[110]2
model as can be seen in Fig. 6(a). This doubling also occurs
along one axis only in the case of the AFM-tetragonal model;
however, this will not give rise to 1
2
1
20 and 1
2
1
21 peaks since we
require spatial doubling along not one but two orthogonal axes.
Therefore, neither the AFM-cubic nor the AFM-tetragonal
models can explain the observed magnetic ordering in these
ﬁlms. It is then surprising that although the LT-RHEED
data suggest a possible cubic/tetragonal structural model, and
the VT-ND data do not uniquely support an orthorhombic
structural model, nonetheless only the type 4 AFM-[110]2
model can explain the magnetic results.
It remains to investigate the (001) surface of CrN using
atomic resolution STM and spin-resolved STM in order to
probe the surface structure and its spin magnetic ordering and
compare that with the results from measurements reported
here. Such future studies could address possible differences
between surface and bulk properties, and between structural
and magnetic behaviors. Really thin ﬁlms could differ from
thicker ones and even possibly stabilize the AFM-tetragonal
state, and in any case STM measurements could prove essential
in order to fully understand the CrN system.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, an overall consistent picture of the structural
and magnetic properties of N-plasma MBE-grown CrN thin
ﬁlms is presented, and intriguing and unique results are
shown. Variable temperature RHEED reveals a clear structural
transition with a transition temperature of (278 ± 3) K for very
thin CrN ﬁlms (37 and 150 nm). This agrees well with the
structural and magnetic transition temperatures measured for
signiﬁcantly thicker ﬁlms (670 and 980 nm) using VT-ND
which ﬁnd values of (280 ± 2) K (magnetic transition)
for a stoichiometric ﬁlm, and (268 ± 3) K/(270 ± 2) K
(structural/magnetic transition) for a 7% N-deﬁcient ﬁlm.
These observed structural and magnetic transitions may be
correlated with an electronic phase transition observed by
Constantin et al. in the same temperature range, for similarly
grown ﬁlms [9].
First-principles theoretical calculations were employed
to investigate possible structural/magnetic models including
nonmagnetic, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic models.
The three antiferromagnetic models AFM-[110]2 (Corliss
model), AFM-cubic, and AFM-tetragonal, are energeti-
cally better than nonmagnetic or ferromagnetic, with the
AFM-[110]2 model being the energetically most favorable
model.
The structural symmetry observed by LT-RHEED suggests
a cubic or tetragonal model in the case of the very thin
ﬁlms (t ⩽150 nm), while VT-ND does not rule out the
possibility of a full orthorhombic distortion for much thicker
ﬁlms (t ⩾980 nm). Nonetheless, the magnetic symmetry
required to explain the observed 1
2
1
20 and 1
2
1
21 magnetic peaks
seen in VT-ND precludes the possibility of having either the
AFM-cubic or AFM-tetragonal model in the case of the thick
ﬁlms. It is somewhat surprising that although the ﬁlm data are
consistent with a partial suppression of a full orthorhombic
distortion, possibly due to epitaxial constraint of the cubic
MgO substrate, nonetheless, the double-layer AFM-[110]2
magnetism is still established in the thicker ﬁlms.
On the other hand, for the two thinnest ﬁlms, since VT-ND
was not applied to measure the phase transitions, we cannot
make the same conclusions; therefore, it is possible that the
epitaxial constraints of the substrate could play a bigger role
in the structural and/or magnetic properties of very thin CrN
ﬁlms. These constraints could potentially stabilize a cubic or
tetragonal-type structure in very thin ﬁlms and change the
magnetic ordering as well, which cannot be measured using
bulk techniques. From this perspective, spin-polarized STM
studies of very thin CrN ﬁlms, as well as thicker ones, could
potentially address this issue.
