Materials that exhibit simultaneous order in their electric and 
magnetic ground states hold promise for use in next-generation 
memory devices in which electric fields control magnetism1,2. 
Such materials are exceedingly rare, however, owing to competing 
requirements for displacive ferroelectricity and magnetism3. Despite 
the recent identification of several new multiferroic materials 
and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms4–15, known single-
phase multiferroics remain limited by antiferromagnetic or weak 
ferromagnetic alignments, by a lack of coupling between the order 
parameters, or by having properties that emerge only well below 
room temperature, precluding device applications2. Here we present 
a methodology for constructing single-phase multiferroic materials 
in which ferroelectricity and strong magnetic ordering are coupled 
near room temperature. Starting with hexagonal LuFeO3—the 
geometric ferroelectric with the greatest known planar rumpling16—
we introduce individual monolayers of FeO during growth to 
construct formula-unit-thick syntactic layers of ferrimagnetic 
LuFe2O4 (refs 17, 18) within the LuFeO3 matrix, that is, (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices. The severe rumpling imposed by the 
neighbouring LuFeO3 drives the ferrimagnetic LuFe2O4 into a 
simultaneously ferroelectric state, while also reducing the LuFe2O4 
spin frustration. This increases the magnetic transition temperature 
substantially—from 240 kelvin for LuFe2O4 (ref. 18) to 281 kelvin 
for (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1. Moreover, the ferroelectric order couples 
to the ferrimagnetism, enabling direct electric-field control of 
magnetism at 200 kelvin. Our results demonstrate a design 
methodology for creating higher-temperature magnetoelectric 
multiferroics by exploiting a combination of geometric frustration, 
lattice distortions and epitaxial engineering.
Advances in thin-film deposition have enabled materials to be 
rationally designed at the atomic-scale where the local chemistry, 
­bonding and electronic environment can be tailored to stabilize 
­emergent phenomena19. Here we exploit such techniques to directly 
perturb the structural environment of the frustrated hexagonal 
ferrimagnet LuFe2O4 at the sub-ångström scale, tuning the magnetic 
order to construct a new magnetoelectric multiferroic. LuFe2O4 was 
purported to be simultaneously ferrimagnetic and ferroelectric at 
250 K—the highest temperature of any known material17. Although 
its ferrimagnetic ordering is widely affirmed18, recent studies find 
that LuFe2O4 is not ferroelectric20,21. A robust high-­temperature fer-
roelectric with a closely related structure exists, however: hexagonal 
LuFeO3. Although metastable, hexagonal LuFeO3 has been grown in 
thin-film form by epitaxial stabilization22. Isostructural to YMnO3,

it is an improper ferroelectric16,23, in which the rumpling of the 
Lu–O planes and corresponding tilt of the Fe–O trigonal ­bipyramids 
lead to ­geometric ferroelectricity that persists well above room 
­temperature24,25. At low temperature (below the Néel temperature TN), 
hexagonal LuFeO3 orders antiferromagnetically; slight canting of the 
spins gives rise to weak ferromagnetism16,24,25.
Here we synthesize superlattices of LuFe2O4 and LuFeO3 by 
­reactive-oxide molecular-beam epitaxy (see Methods); the ferroelectric 
distortions of LuFeO3 are exploited to reduce the spin frustration and 
enhance the magnetic transition of LuFe2O4. The resulting (LuFeO3)9/
(LuFe2O4)1 superlattice is magnetically ordered up to 281 K and 
­exhibits short-range ferromagnetic fluctuations that persist, together 
with ­ferroelectricity, above room temperature. We corroborate this 
result using methods that are insensitive to magnetic impurity phases 
(for example, neutron diffraction) or electrical leakage (for example, 
high-resolution electron microscopy) and show that our results are 
consistent with first-principles calculations.
Figure 1a shows high-angle annular dark field scanning ­transmission 
electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of the LuFeO3 and 
LuFe2O4 end-members and Fig. 1b the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 
­superlattices for m = 1 to m = 10. X-ray diffraction (XRD) ­patterns are 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 1, supporting the observed high structural 
­quality. The characteristic ‘up-up-down’ pattern of the lutetium atoms 
in LuFeO3 (ref. 24), which is also present in the ­hexagonal ­manganites26, 
is evident and reflects the polar nature of these superlattices. 
The polarization monotonically tracks the ­magnitude of this ­lutetium 
­trimer distortion16 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2), ­rendering 
HAADF-STEM a local probe of ferroelectricity27. Inspecting 
the images in Fig. 1, we note that distortions are present in the 
(LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 series for m ≥​ 2. The ferroelectric rumpling 
was not observed in LuFe2O4, consistent with previous work28, or the 
(LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)n series at room temperature.
The magnetic properties of the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)n superlattices 
were characterized with a superconducting quantum interference 
device (SQUID) magnetometer (Methods). Field-cooled magnetization 
versus temperature (M–T) curves are displayed in Fig. 2a and Extended 
Data Fig. 3a, b. The shapes of the M–T curves for the superlattices are 
the same as that for LuFe2O4, implying that the magnetization observed 
in the superlattices is probably ferromagnetic and of the same kind as 
in LuFe2O4 (ref. 20). Loops of the magnetization as a function of the 
magnetic field for the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattice are shown 
in Fig. 2b; the shape of the loop at 300 K is similar to that at 200 K, 
suggesting that short-range ferromagnetic fluctuations persist above 
room temperature. In Fig. 2c, the ferromagnetic Curie ­temperature 
TC,mag is plotted as a function of the fraction of iron ions that sit in 
the LuFeO3 layers, m/(m +​ 2n). The magnetic transitions in the 
superlattices are higher than in thin films of both of the constituent 
­components, LuFeO3 (TN = 147 K) and LuFe2O4 (TC,mag = 219 K; 
slightly different from single crystals owing to substrate choice29 and 
our conservative definition of TC,mag (see Methods)). This enhancement

was previously observed in single-crystalline Lu2Fe3O7 (ref. 30). For 
the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 series, TC,mag increases to 281 K for m = 9. 
The saturated magnetic moment per LuFe2O4 iron cation at 50 K is 
plotted in Fig. 2d (see Methods). There is a pronounced deviation in 
the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices for m ≥​ 2: here, the LuFe2O4 
moment increases with m reaching about 2μB per iron cation (with μB 
the Bohr magneton) for the m = 15 superlattice. Similar ­enhancements 
in the moment are observed at 100 K and 200 K as well (Methods, 
Extended Data Fig. 3c). We further corroborate the enhancement in 
TC,mag with neutron diffraction of a (LuFeO3)6/(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice 
(Methods, Extended Data Fig. 4). Not only is the onset of magnetic 
order revealed by neutron scattering consistent with that measured 
by SQUID, but the magnetic ordering corresponds to a reflection in 
the superlattice structure that is not present in bulk LuFe2O4. Further, 
it is coherent through six superlattice repeats along the c direction of 
the lattice.
In addition to magnetic order, spontaneous polarization can also 
be tracked across the superlattice series. We quantify the ­ferroelectric 
lutetium distortions at 300 K from HAADF-STEM images such as 
those in Fig. 1 (Methods, Extended Data Figs 2, 5, 6). The ­polarization 
resulting from this displacement is plotted in Fig. 2e; it ­continuously 
increases in the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices for m ≥​ 2, 
reaching approximately 6 μC cm−2 for the high-m superlattices. The 
­temperature dependence of the ferroelectric order in the (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices was further probed using variable-­temperature 
X-ray ­linear dichroism (XLD) as shown in Fig. 2f (see Methods, 
Extended Data Fig. 7)31,32. Fittings to a universal order ­parameter 
suggest ­ferroelectric transitions at about 550 K and 500 K for the 
m = 3 and m = 5 samples, respectively. The dichroic signal for the 
m = 9 sample persists beyond the measurement range, suggesting a 
higher-­temperature ferroelectric transition. Finally, piezoresponse 
force microscopy (PFM) was used to investigate the local ­ferroelectric 
switching in the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 film (Methods). As shown 
in Fig. 2g, the poled domain structure persists for at least 100 h after 
writing, demonstrating the ability to reversibly and robustly switch 
the spontaneous polarization. See Methods for the in-plane electrical 
characterization.
Figure 2 suggests two distinct regions in the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)n 
phase diagram: region I for 0 <​ m/(m +​ 2n) <​ 0.5 where TC,mag ­saturates 
at about 250 K and region II for 0.5 ≤ m/(m +​ 2n) <​ 1 where a further 
increase in TC,mag to 281 K occurs simultaneously with a near-linear 
enhancement of the magnetic moment and (of particular note) the 
ferroelectric polarization. See Methods for a discussion of region I. 
The behaviour of the region II superlattices is elucidated from first-­
principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of both 
‘model LuFe2O4’ systems and particular superlattices; see Methods. 
The key to understanding the observed enhancements in TC,mag is the 
­interplay between ferroelectricity associated with the LuFeO3 layers 
and ­magnetism in the LuFe2O4 layers.
We first determine that the lowest energy state of LuFe2O4 
is the ­antiferroelectric charge-ordered (‘COI’) state, shown in 
Fig. 3a. The ferroelectric charge-ordered (‘COII’) state shown in 
Fig. 3b, however, is only 4 meV per formula unit above the ground state. 
All other charge-ordered configurations have much higher energies 
(>​50 meV per formula unit). Although the COI and COII states are 
nearly degenerate, the trimer lutetium distortions (which are not 
observed experimentally in bulk LuFe2O4) are forbidden by ­symmetry 
in the COI structure, but are allowed—and are large—in the COII

structure. We parameterize an Ising spin model from first principles 
to simulate the temperature dependence of the magnetization for the 
COI and COII states as shown in Fig. 3a, b. Additionally, we ­construct 
‘model LuFe2O4’ COII structures, varying the magnitude of the 
lutetium trimer distortion Q; the power of a first-principles 
approach is that it gives us access to structures that are not available 
­experimentally. Artificially increasing the trimer distortion tunes 
the relative strength of the in-plane interactions and reduces the 
magnetic frustration (Extended Data Fig. 8b); this in turn increases 
the magnetic ­transition TC,mag as shown in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, 
the ­trimer distortion ­immediately destabilizes the COI state and 
­transforms the system to the COII state. These observations ­suggest 
that the enhancement of TC,mag in the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 
­superlattices is attributable to the ferroelectric trimer distortions 
imposed by the LuFeO3 layers.
Next we consider the enhancement of the magnetic moment 
that occurs simultaneously with the increase in the ferroelectric 
­polarization in region II (Fig. 2d). We note the presence of many 
­magnetic ­configurations within a few millielectronvolts of each other 
in each charge-ordered state (Extended Data Fig. 9b) and no clear 
­experimental evidence as to the magnetic ground state. Nevertheless, 
we outline two potential scenarios for magnetic enhancement. First, 
direct first-principles calculations for m ≥​ 3 superlattices reveal the 
existence of ‘self-doped’ structures, which consist of bilayers with a 
2:1 ratio between Fe3+ and Fe2+ (Extended Data Fig. 10). For ­example, 
in the m = 3 superlattice this increases the net magnetization from 
M = 1.2μB per iron cation to M = 1.3μB per iron cation. As the trimer 
distortion increases, the system is driven from a ferroelectric state to 
this self-doped structure, thereby leading to an increase in M as the 
polarization increases. Second, if we can take seriously the magnetic 
energies for LuFe2O4 determined from DFT, then the ground-state 
magnetization of the COI state is M = 0.5μB per iron cation, whereas 
the lowest energy of the COII state has M = 1.2μB per iron cation. As 
the trimer distortion transforms the system from the COI state to the 
COII state, the saturated magnetization increases by nearly 1μB per iron 
cation. In this case, the linear dependence of M on the polarization is 
probably an indication of different atomic-scale, coexisting magnetic 
domains in each charge-ordered state.
Finally, we demonstrate that the near-room-temperature ferrim-
agnetism observed in the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattice directly 
couples to the ferroelectric order. A (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 film 
was electrically poled at 300 K to construct distinct ‘up’ and ‘down’ 
c-­oriented polar domains as shown in Fig. 4a (and similar to Fig. 2g). 
The resulting magnetic order was then imaged at 200 K and 320 K using 
X-ray magnetic circular dichroic photoemission electron microscopy 
(XMCD PEEM) on the Fe L3 edge (see Methods). As shown in the ratio 
images in Fig. 4b, c, the magnetic ordering directly correlates with the 
­electrically poled domain structure, demonstrating magnetoelectric 
­coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism. As shown in Fig. 4d, the 
dichroic contrast on the iron sites decreases by about 70% between 200 K 
and 300 K, consistent with the reduction in the magnetization observed at 
these temperatures in the same film by SQUID (Extended Data Fig. 3e).
We have engineered a strong, magnetically ordered ferroelectric with 
simultaneous order near room temperature. In particular, we show that 
the ferroelectric trimer distortions intrinsic to hexagonal LuFeO3 can 
be used to locally tune the structural environment of the frustrated 
magnetism that is present on adjacent LuFe2O4 layers in a manner that 
enhances the magnetic transition. We demonstrate ­magnetoelectric 
coupling of this ferroelectric polarization to the co-­linear ­ferrimagnetic 
order at 200 K. Such coupling is probably distinct from the better-­
studied Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya coupling previously observed 
between ferroelectricity and weakly canted antiferromagnetism at 
room ­temperature in BiFeO3 (refs 6, 12). Further understanding of 
this coupling mechanism could guide the design of higher-­temperature 
­ferromagnetic ferroelectrics that can be deterministically switched 
between symmetry-equivalent states using an electric field.

Methods
Growth of (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)n thin films. Thin films of (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)n were grown by reactive-oxide molecular-beam epitaxy in a Veeco 
GEN10 system on (111) (ZrO2)0.905(Y2O3)0.095 (or 9.5 mol% yttria-stabilized 
­zirconia) substrates, denoted YSZ, held at a temperature of about 700 °C. This 
substrate temperature was determined by an optical pyrometer focused on an 
opaque, 200-nm-thick, ­platinum layer on the backside of the YSZ substrates used 
to absorb the heat from the SiC radiative substrate heater. Lutetium and iron were 
evaporated from ­elemental sources each at a flux of approximately 1 ×​ 1013 atoms 
per square ­centimetre per second. The fluxes were first calibrated (approximately) 
with a quartz crystal microbalance. The lutetium flux was then more accurately 
refined using the reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) intensity 
oscillations that occurred when (111) Lu2O3 was deposited on (111) YSZ. With the 
known ­lutetium flux, the iron flux was adjusted to produce a stoichiometric LuFeO3 
film as judged by the out-of-plane lattice parameter measured by XRD33. The 
­background ­oxygen partial pressure was meticulously varied during the superlattice 
growth to provide an environment sufficiently oxidizing for the Fe3+ in the LuFeO3 
­without over-oxidizing the Fe2.5+ in the LuFe2O4 layers. The background partial 
­pressure of a mixture of about 2% O3 and O2 was varied between 3 ×​ 10−7 Torr 
and 9 ×​ 10−7 Torr using a capacitance manometer to control the inlet pressure of a 
piezoelectric leak valve. Each growth sequence commenced with at least five 
­monolayers of the LuFeO3 structure before the first LuFe2O4 layer to avoid over-­
oxidation of the LuFe2O4 by oxygen supplied by the YSZ substrate. (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)n superlattices with thicknesses ranging from 28 nm to 35 nm were 
studied.
The structure was characterized by XRD using a four-circle Rigaku SmartLab 
diffractometer equipped with a Ge(220) ×​ 2 monochromator on the incident side 
and a Ge(220) ×​ 2 analyser on the diffracted side, with Cu Kα radiation. XRD θ–2θ 
scans of all samples presented as well as a representative rocking curve are shown 
in Extended Data Fig. 1.
High-resolution and variable-temperature electron microscopy. Cross-sectional 
TEM specimens were prepared using an FEI Strata 400 Focused Ion Beam (FIB) 
with a final milling step of 2 keV to reduce surface damage. High-resolution 
HAADF-STEM images were acquired on a 100-keV Nion UltraSTEM, a fifth- 
order aberration-corrected microscope. The images in Fig. 1b were acquired from 
a single sample containing the representative layering patterns in this study.
The lutetium distortions were quantified from HAADF-STEM images. Several 
images were averaged to reduce scan noise and the lutetium atomic positions were 
determined through an iterative two-dimensional Gaussian fitting ­procedure 
and segmentation using a watershed algorithm. The position of each atom was 
then compared to its neighbouring atom on each side in the same atomic plane. 
The magnitude and direction of the distortion was calculated by comparing the 
height difference of the three atoms as shown in Extended Data Fig. 6a. The 
­schematics show different patterns of three-atom sets corresponding to the marked 
­polarization. This distortion directly correlates with the ferroelectric polarization 
as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. The resulting polarization at different locations 
in the structure is plotted in Extended Data Fig. 5 and in the aggregate in Extended 
Data Fig. 6b, c. In sum, the distortions from over 90,000 lutetium atoms were 
analysed to generate the results shown in Fig. 2e.
The temperature dependence of the lutetium distortions was measured using 
a Protochips Aduro double-tilt heating holder in a 200-keV FEI Tecnai F20-ST 
microscope as shown in Extended Data Fig. 6d. A cross-sectional TEM ­specimen 
was prepared by FIB as above and then mounted onto a ceramic heating chip. 
The temperature was controlled on the chip by passing a current, which was 
calibrated to be within 50 K of the intended temperature. HAADF-STEM images 
were recorded at intervals as the sample was heated from 290 K to 675 K. The 
­ferroelectric distortions were estimated from the strength of the superlattice 
reflections observed in the fast Fourier transform of the image corresponding to 
the tripling of the unit cell from the lutetium distortions. We label regions where 
ferroelectric distortions were observed, where weak distortions were observed and 
where the distortions were not observed (although they may be present, they are 
below our resolution limit).
Magnetic characterization with SQUID. Magnetic measurements were ­performed 
with a Quantum Design MPMS3 SQUID magnetometer. M–T curves with the 
sample field-cooled in 1 kOe and zero-field-cooled were measured for each sample, 
along with a bare YSZ substrate that had undergone identical ­deposition ­conditions 
as a superlattice (same oxygen partial pressure and time at growth temperature, 
but not exposed to the lutetium or iron molecular beams). The M–T curves 
of the YSZ substrate were used to subtract the diamagnetic and ­paramagnetic 
­backgrounds from the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)n M–T curves. The curves in 
Fig. 2a were ­normalized to facilitate comparison of the Curie ­temperatures 
(TC,mag) at which the superlattices order ferromagnetically (or ferrimagnetically). 
The ­ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) Curie temperature was taken to be the 
­intersection between a line extending from the point of steepest descent of the 
field-cooled curve and a line extending from the high-temperature background.
M–H loops (where H is the magnetic field) out to 70 kOe were measured 
for each sample at 50 K, 100 K, 200 K and 300 K. The linear diamagnetic back-
ground for each of these loops was subtracted with a linear fit to the high-field 
data. At higher temperature the loops saturate, but below 130 K the loops did not 
saturate, and an additional M–H loop was measured with the sample field-cooled 
in 70 KOe to measure the saturated magnetic moment at these temperatures. The 
known bulk magnetic moment of LuFeO3 (ref. 11) was subtracted from the total 
measured magnetic moment to obtain the LuFe2O4 magnetic moments shown 
in Fig. 2d. Extended Data Fig. 3c displays ‘excess magnetization’ as a function of 
composition at 50 K, 100 K and 200 K. This value was found by subtracting the 
magnetization due to the end-member LuFeO3 and LuFe2O4 signals from the total 
moment observed.
Neutron scattering. Neutron diffraction was performed on the BT-4 triple-axis 
spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research using pyrolytic graphite 
monochromator and analyser crystals with neutrons of initial and final energies 
of 14.7 meV (λ = 2.359 Å). Relaxed horizontal collimation settings of the neutron 
optics in stream order were open–monochromator–40′​–sample–40′​–analyser–
open–detector to maximize the intensity of the very weak scattered signal. The 
sample was mounted onto a silicon wafer using a small amount of aluminium foil 
and sealed in an aluminium canister with 4He gas to ensure thermal equilibration 
with the closed-cycle refrigerator.
Neutron diffraction was used to determine the onset of long-range magnetic 
order of a (LuFeO3)6/(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice. Neutron scattering is not sensitive to 
small impurity phases that may influence other bulk characterization techniques. 
Magnetic reflections of the (LuFeO3)6/(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice were observed in 
neutron diffraction by scanning along the [10L] reciprocal lattice direction, where 
the Miller index L is along the c axis or growth direction, at several temperatures 
between 5 K and 325 K. We found a single 101 magnetic reflection (indexed to 
the magnetic unit cell of 10.4 nm, or two superlattice repeat distances) at 5 K that 
was not present at room temperature. This peak is observed to show considerable 
change in intensity between 5 K and room temperature as shown in Extended 
Data Fig. 4a. The centre of the peak is offset slightly from the 101 reflection owing 
to a slight misalignment of the sample. A Gaussian function is fit to the signal 
to ­determine the integrated intensity as a function of temperature. Disregarding 
finite-size effects of the films along the growth direction, the full width of the 
resolution function is shown as the horizontal line (black), demonstrating that the 
peak is not resolution-limited. The magnetic correlation length from this is found 
to be ξ ≈​ 30 nm, or roughly six superlattice units along the c direction.
The onset of magnetic order was determined by fitting the temperature- 
dependent integrated intensity of the peak with a mean-field order parameter. 
Shown in Extended Data Fig. 4b, we find TC,mag = 238 ±​ 28 K. This is ­consistent 
with the onset of ferromagnetism (or ferrimagnetism) determined from 
­magnetometry of a (LuFeO3)6/(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice (246 K).
To understand the origin of this 101 reflection, we calculated the magnetic 
structure factors for the magnetic moment arrangement obtained from DFT for 
the COII and Fe3+-doped configurations of the (LuFeO3)3/(LuFe2O4)1 ­superlattice. 
These calculations show that 10L-type reflections are particularly sensitive to the 
onset of ferrimagnetic order along the c axis in the LuFe2O4 layers in the charge-­
ordered state.
X-ray linear dichroism. X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the Fe L2,3 edge was 
performed at Beamline 4.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory. Spectra were acquired with 100% linearly polarized light 
oriented nearly parallel to and perpendicular to the c axis of the sample for an 
angle of X-ray incidence of 20° to the sample surface. The normalized difference 
between these spectra was collected for temperatures ranging from 300 K to 
700 K for (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1, (LuFeO3)5/(LuFe2O4)1, (LuFeO3)3/(LuFe2O4)1 
and (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)3. All temperatures measured were above the ­magnetic 
­transition temperatures of the corresponding films and so the dichroic signal 
records an asymmetry in the electronic structure, as previously recorded for 
­ferroelectric thin films31. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 7b, the (LuFeO3)1/
(LuFe2O4)3 sample displays dichroism of about 20% at 300 K due to the structural 
anisotropy between the in-plane and out-of-plane electronic configurations in 
the hexagonal structure. A smaller anisotropy was also previously recorded for 
LuFe2O4 (ref. 34).
Previous calibration of the endstation has identified a systematic error of 
approximately ±​5% in the measured dichroism due to the variation of the degree 
of X-ray polarization, the angle of X-ray incidence and photon energy with 
time. To further determine the uncertainty associated with these measurements, 
we measured the dichroic signal from the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 sample ­multiple

times before sample heating and again after the sample heating/irradiation. 
From comparison of the dichroic signal, we find a standard error of the mean of 
­approximately 0.016 (4% in un-normalized units), within the uncertainty estimated 
from the previous calibration.
The (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1, (LuFeO3)5/(LuFe2O4)1 and (LuFeO3)3/(LuFe2O4)1 
samples, which were identified as displaying ferroelectric lutetium ­distortions 
by HAADF-STEM, demonstrated a dichroism of about 40% at 300 K. The 
­temperature-dependent fits of the recorded difference spectra as a linear 
­combination of the structural (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)3 component and (LuFeO3)9/
(LuFe2O4)1 component at 300 K are shown in Fig. 2f. There is a drop in the 
recorded signal for the (LuFeO3)5/(LuFe2O4)1 and (LuFeO3)3/(LuFe2O4)1 samples 
indicative of a ferroelectric transition. The XLD signal does not decrease fully to 
the signal observed in (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)3, suggesting that there may be an 
­additional structural component in the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 films that is not 
captured by the (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)3 component. The data shown in Fig. 2f were 
fitted to an order parameter plus a constant background using a Bayesian fitting 
­algorithm. From this, we identify a transition TC,el at about 550 K and 500 K in the 
(LuFeO3)3/(LuFe2O4)1 and (LuFeO3)5/(LuFe2O4)1 sample, respectively. Assuming 
the same constant background for the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 sample, we estimate 
a ­transition near 900 K, beyond the measurement range of this experiment. The 
­variable-temperature HAADF-STEM images (Extended Data Fig. 6d) recorded 
from these layering patterns are also consistent with transitions at ­comparable 
temperatures, although slightly different transitions between the m = 3 and 
m = 5 superlattices are found. The high-temperature transition in the (LuFeO3)9/
(LuFe2O4)1 superlattice is consistent with the observation of superlattice reflections 
in RHEED corresponding to the trimer distortion24 during thin-film deposition 
at the growth temperature for this film.
Piezoelectric force microscopy. Vertical (or out-of-plane) PFM was used to 
measure the ferroelectric polarizability of the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattice 
shown in Figs 2g and 4a35–37. A bottom electrode was added to the sample after 
thin-film deposition. The substrate was first thinned using tripod mechanical 
polishing at a 1° angle; the measured region had a substrate thickness of 
­approximately 150 nm. A copper adhesion layer and subsequent platinum layer 
were deposited onto the thinned substrate by direct-current magnetron sputtering 
in an argon background of 3 ×​ 10−3 Torr at room temperature. This provided a 
conducting back electrode for the PFM experiments without disturbing the epitaxy 
of the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 film on the insulating YSZ substrate.
In Fig. 2g, a 20 μm ×​ 20 μm region was poled with a d.c. bias of −​15 V to switch 
the sample to the ‘upward’-oriented out-of-plane polarization. A second switch 
with a d.c. bias of +​15 V was then performed to write the pattern shown with 
the corresponding ‘downward’-oriented polarization. The resulting structure was 
imaged directly after poling and again 100 h later using a 2-V a.c. voltage. The 
image acquired after 100 h was rotated after acquisition to follow the orientation in 
the original image. The persistence of the written structure demonstrates the ability 
to reversibly switch the ferroelectric polarization with an electric field. In Fig. 4a, 
a 15 μm ×​ 15 μm region was poled using a single switch of a d.c. bias at +​15 V and 
−​15 V (applied to the cantilever tip), generating a ‘downward’- and ‘upward’-­
oriented out-of-plane polarization, plotted in red and turquoise, ­respectively. 
The magnetic structure presented in Fig. 4b–d was measured nearly 200 h after 
the initial poling shown in Fig. 4a, further corroborating the persistence of the 
switched state.
Variable-temperature and magnetic field transport measurements. Variable-
temperature and magnetic field transport measurements were made in the van 
der Pauw geometry and performed using the combination of a Quantum Design 
PPMS and external Keithley electronics. Measurements were made of the in-plane 
resistivity, for example, parallel to the (0001) planes. The resistivity increases 
­substantially as the temperature is lowered until it is beyond our measurement 
abilities below about 200 K. Resistivity values for the entire stack of the two samples 
we measured, (LuFeO3)6/(LuFe2O4)1 and (LuFeO3)8/(LuFe2O4)1, are 4.3–86.5 Ω​ cm 
over the 330–198 K temperature range. Plotting the natural logarithm of the 
conductivity as various powers of inverse temperature suggests that conduction 
is primarily through thermally activated carriers. No anomaly in the resistivity 
at TC,mag or any changes in resistivity with the application of a magnetic field 
(0 T, 5 T and 9 T) were observed. We attempted, but were unable (the sample 
was too resistive), to measure a bare YSZ substrate that had undergone identical 
deposition conditions as a superlattice (the same oxygen partial pressure and time 
at growth temperature, but not exposed to the lutetium or iron molecular beams) 
to determine if the primary conduction path was mediated by oxygen vacancies 
generated in the substrate.
Possible origin of the enhancement of the magnetic transition of the (LuFeO3)1/
(LuFe2O4)n superlattices. The enhancement of TC,mag in region I could be caused 
by strain or oxygen stoichiometry effects. Lutetium atom distortions were not 
observed in these superlattices. A slight mismatch between the LuFeO3 in-plane 
lattice (a = 5.989 ±​ 0.005 Å in thick relaxed epitaxial films25 or 3.458 Å for 
the ­primitive cell) and the bulk LuFe2O4 (a = 3.4406 Å; ref. 38) produces a ­tensile 
strain of up to 0.25% on the LuFe2O4 layers; epitaxial strain has previously been 
shown to affect ferromagnetic transitions7,39,40. In region I, TC,mag reaches 250 K, 
­approximately the transition observed in LuFe2O4 single crystals17. Previous 
­experiments have shown that the magnetic properties of LuFe2O4 are extremely 
sensitive to deviations in oxygen stoichiometry41 and thus a small amount of 
­oxygen diffusion between the LuFe2O4 and LuFeO3 layers could have also caused 
the increase in TC,mag to 250 K.
LuFe2O4, ‘model LuFe2O4’ and the increase in TC,mag from first principles. 
We use first-principles DFT calculations to elucidate the origin of the increase 
in the magnetic transition temperature TC,mag with the number of LuFeO3 layers 
(Fig. 2c) and, correspondingly, the magnitude of the electrical polarization 
(Fig. 2e). In particular, we perform DFT calculations on what we call ‘model 
LuFe2O4’ systems: bulk-like LuFe2O4 structures with the addition of the trimer 
distortion Q. This trimer distortion is characteristic of LuFeO3 and, as shown in 
Fig. 1b, is experimentally observed in the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices, 
yet is not observed in bulk LuFe2O4. This allows us to derive a simple model that 
elucidates the origin of the effect in the superlattices, without performing DFT 
calculations directly on these larger structures.
First-principles calculations of bulk LuFe2O4. Previous experimental 
work17 has suggested that bulk LuFe2O4 has a net polarization due to a charge 
­disproportionation between the composing iron bilayers. In the first layer (A), an 
Fe2+ ion is at the centre of a hexagon composed of six Fe3+ ions, leading to a 1:2 
ratio of the charges. The second layer (B) has a similar arrangement with a majority 
of Fe2+. It was proposed that the bilayers order to form an ABAB stacking along 
the c direction. We denote this structure as ‘COII’, which is displayed in Fig. 3b and 
reproduced in Extended Data Fig. 10b. This stacking sequence breaks inversion 
symmetry and so is compatible with a ferroelectric state (space group Cm).
We have also considered multiple additional charge-order arrangements, 
­including those compatible with a non-ferroelectric state, consistent with later 
experimental results42,43. We introduce only the low-energy arrangements here. 
One such arrangement has the same bilayer structure as COII, but an opposite 
stacking of the bilayers, for example, ABBA ordering. In this case, a mirror plane 
is located at the Lu–O plane, preserving inversion symmetry (space group C2/m). 
We refer to this structure, displayed in Fig. 3a and reproduced in Extended Data 
Fig. 10a, as ‘COI’. In additional, the layers can be stacked in an AABB ­arrangement 
(proposed in ref. 42, but studied theoretically for the first time here), which we 
denote ‘COIII’ (space group C2/m) and display in Extended Data Fig. 10c. In 
this configuration, the AA and BB bilayers have excess charge and a mirror plane 
located at the centre between two A (B) layers. COI and COIII are non-polar (space 
group C2/m)42,43 and therefore not ferroelectric. We find that COI is the lowest-­
energy configuration, followed by COII, which is higher than COI by only about 
4 meV per formula unit. COIII is higher in energy than COI by more than about 
50 meV per formula unit and therefore will not be considered further. The small 
difference in energy between COI and COII is expected because the two structures 
differ only in long-range inter-bilayer Coulomb interactions. Structurally, however, 
COI and COII have a quite distinct (and relatively easy to experimentally discern) 
difference: the COII configuration induces the lutetium trimer distortions, which 
are forbidden by symmetry in COI.
Magnetic configurations of COI and COII from first principles. One ­difficulty in 
definitively determining the magnetic ground state of LuFe2O4 from first ­principles 
is the presence of multiple magnetic configurations of COI and COII with ­similar 
energy. The energetics of these magnetic configurations in COI and COII are 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 9b. The ground-state magnetization ­identified for 
COI is M = 0.5μB/Fe, whereas the lowest energy of COII has M = 1.2μB/Fe. Both 
COI and COII have low-energy states with M ranging from 0μB/Fe to 1.2μB/Fe.
M versus T from a first-principles parameterized Ising model. According to 
experimental measurements44, LuFe2O4 undergoes a ferrimagnetic transition 
at TC,mag = 240–250 K, resulting in an Ising-like net magnetic moment along 
the c direction. The reported moment ranges from 0.8μB/Fe to 1.4μB/Fe and 
is ­particularly sensitive to oxygen stoichiometry41. We thus consider an Ising 
Hamiltonian to describe the magnetic properties of the LuFe2O4 system:
∑
=
H
J S S
ij
ij
i j
Here Jij is the symmetric super-exchange interaction and the spin Si = ±​2 
(Si = 5/2) for Fe2+ (Fe3+) in trigonal bipyramidal coordination with high spin. 
The six super-exchange interactions considered correspond to nearest-­neighbour 
­interactions for iron (2+​/3+​) located either in the same plane (Jin-plane), in

­neighbouring planes within a bilayer (Jintra) or in neighbouring planes between 
different bilayers (Jinter); see Extended Data Fig. 8a. These parameters are ­estimated 
from first principles. The magnetic ground states and Curie transition temperatures 
are then determined from Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated TC,mag for COI 
(TC,mag ≈​ 500 K) is found to be about a factor of two higher than the ­experimentally 
reported value (TC,mag ≈​ 240 K). The possible origins of this discrepancy are: 
(1) correlations among electrons not captured with DFT +​ U that strongly influence 
the magnetic exchange interactions or (2) relativistic ­interactions between spins 
that are not included in the present model, yet that often strongly compete with 
symmetric exchange interactions. We therefore introduce a normalization factor of 
approximately 0.48 to match the calculated TC,mag of COI with the ­corresponding 
experimentally reported value and use this same factor throughout our study. 
Although, in essence, the TC,mag of bulk (COI) LuFe2O4 becomes a parameter, 
the changes in TC,mag (for example, from COI to COII) are calculated from a 
­parameter-free, first-principles theory. The corresponding results are displayed in 
Fig. 3a and b for COI and COII (with Q ≈​ 1), respectively, where it is seen that the 
ferrimagnetic transition temperature of COII is substantially larger (TC,mag ≈​ 300 K) 
than that of COI.
Model LuFe2O4. Noting that COII induces lutetium trimer distortions, we repeat 
our Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetic transition for different values of 
Q. As shown in Fig. 3b, we observe that TC,mag monotonically increases with the 
magnitude of this distortion. Calculated super-exchange values as a function 
of distortion are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8b. The largest super-exchange 
­interactions correspond to in-plane interactions and follow a linear trend as a 
function of Q. Although the Fe3+–Fe3+ interactions increase and become more 
antiferromagnetic, the Fe2+–Fe2+ interactions follow the opposite trend. The Fe2+–
Fe3+ interactions do not exhibit substantial variation as a function of Q. This result 
is consistent with the Goodenough–Kanamori–Anderson (GKA) rules considering 
the change in angle for the Fe–O–Fe super-exchange in-plane paths as illustrated 
in Extended Data Fig. 8a. As the distortions are increased, on average the Fe–O–Fe 
angle becomes larger than the undistorted value of 118° for Fe3+–Fe3+ ­interactions, 
smaller for Fe2+–Fe2+ and unchanged for Fe2+–Fe3+. Because the Fe2+ and 
Fe3+ ions both have partially filled d orbitals, the GKA rules predict antiferro-
magnetic and ferromagnetic super-exchange interactions for 180°and 90° angles, 
respectively, consistent with the trend observed in Extended Data Fig. 8b. The 
observed control of TC,mag by the trimer distortion is universal, parameter-free and 
is independent of any specific detail of the first-principles methods.
First-principles calculations of the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 structures. DFT 
­calculations were also performed on the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 periodic supercells 
for superlattices with m = 1, 3 and 5. The size of these supercells varies depending 
on whether m is odd or even. For odd values of m, the number of (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)1 blocks has to be doubled along the out-of-plane direction to obtain 
a periodic supercell. For even values, the number of blocks has to be tripled. 
Additionally, taking into account that trimerization of the LuFeO3 structure and 
charge order of the LuFe2O4 structure demand a supercell containing three formula 
units per plane, the total number of atoms for the different periodic (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)1 supercells is N = 6(5m +​ 7) and N = 9(5m +​ 7), for odd and even values 
of m, respectively. Owing to computational constraints, most of our calculations 
were performed on (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)1 (72 atoms) and (LuFeO3)3/(LuFe2O4)1 
(132 atoms) supercells. Calculations were also performed on (LuFeO3)5/(LuFe2O4)1 
supercells (192 atoms)—without considering full structural optimizations—to 
­confirm the key result obtained for m = 3, that is, stabilization of hole-doped 
LuFe2O4 blocks with head-to-head domain walls occurring in the middle of 
LuFeO3 blocks, as discussed below.
Charge order and magnetism in a single ferroelectric domain. In a single 
­ferroelectric domain of a (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattice, the most ­stable 
charge-order configuration is COII, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 10d for m = 3. 
The lowest-energy magnetic configuration corresponds to the same ­ferrimagnetic 
arrangement found in bulk LuFe2O4 with the COII pattern, ­characterized by 
M = 1.2μB/Fe. Once LuFeO3 is added to LuFe2O4—that is, (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 
superlattices with m ≥​ 1—the COI pattern becomes unstable. The single-­
domain configuration with the COII pattern of the m = 3 (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 
­superlattice is metastable against multidomain configurations, even under E = 0 
electrical boundary conditions. We refer to the multidomain configurations as 
(1) ‘undoped-type’ (Extended Data Fig. 10e) and (2) ‘doped-type’ (Extended Data 
Fig. 10f). For the m = 1 composition, the difference in energy between the domain 
types is negligible. By contrast, for the m = 3 superlattice, the doped-type domain 
configuration is about 8 meV per formula unit more stable than the undoped-
type, which itself is about 8 meV per formula unit more stable than the single-­
domain configuration, demonstrating the added stability of this configuration with 
­increasing m. We also verified that the doped-type domain configuration remains 
the most stable for the m = 5 superlattice.
Ferroelectric undoped-type domain. The undoped-type structure corresponds to 
the COII ordering pattern in which the AB bilayers are stacked in ABAB sequence 
along the c direction. Here the superlattice exhibits charged tail-to-tail and head-to-
head ferroelectric domain walls. For the m = 3 superlattice, the tail-to-tail domain 
wall occurs at the interface between a bilayer and LuFeO3, whereas the head-to-
head domain wall always occurs in the LuFeO3 block next to the second bilayer, as 
labelled in Extended Data Fig. 10e. The magnetism of this structure is similar to 
the single ferroelectric domain case shown in Extended Data Fig. 10d.
Ferroelectric doped-type domain. The starting point to understanding the doped-
type domain structure is again the COII ordering pattern of the bulk LuFe2O4. In 
this case, however, nearly an electron of charge from a Fe2+ cation located in the 
A layer of LuFe2O4 is transferred to an Fe3+ cation located in the LuFeO3 layer, 
as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 10f. This results in Fe3+-rich iron bilayers 
and a ­corresponding stacking sequence of AAAA (see Extended Data Fig. 10f). 
Therefore, we can consider the head-to-head domains in this configuration as 
being stabilized as a result of LuFe2O4 layers electron-doping the LuFeO3 layers. 
Indeed, in the doped-type domains, the tail-to-tail domain wall occurs at the 
­interface between a bilayer and LuFeO3, whereas the head-to-head domain wall 
occurs right at the doping layer in the LuFeO3 block, as shown in Extended Data 
Fig. 10f.
Alternatively, we can consider the LuFeO3 layers as hole-doping the LuFe2O4. 
In this doped-type of ferroelectric domain, the only contribution to the total 
­magnetization in the hole-doped LuFe2O4 layers is from ferromagnetically 
aligned Fe2+ ions located at the centre of the Fe3+ hexagons. Because the in-plane 
Fe3+–Fe3+ super-exchange interactions are always found to be antiferromagnetic, 
there is no net contribution due to the Fe3+ ions. This leads to a magnetization of 
M = 1.33μB/Fe for each Fe3+-doped bilayer, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 9c.
Although this charged domain-wall configuration might appear energetically 
unfavourable, mobile carriers redistribute to screen the excess of bound charges. 
The calculated density of states for each iron cation in the heterostructure is shown 
in Extended Data Fig. 10e. Our calculations demonstrate that electrons migrate 
from the LuFe2O4 block to occupy iron states in contiguous LuFeO3 layers, which 
nevertheless remain insulating. Owing to the shift in the electrostatic potential 
caused by LuFeO3 dipoles, conducting Fe d states appear at the head-to-head 
domain walls (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Because the potential drop across the 
structure should increase with superlattice periodicity, we expect the electrical 
conductivity of the walls to grow monotonically with m. The same qualitative 
trends are observed in the m = 5 superlattices.
Computational details. Structural relaxations of bulk LuFe2O4 were performed 
using the DFT +​ U method45 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)46 form of 
exchange correlation functional as implemented in VASP code47. We used the 
projector-augmented plane-wave method48. We considered Lu 4f states in the core; 
for Fe 3d states we chose UFe = 4.5 eV (where UFe is the screened Coulomb 
­interaction) and J = 0.95 eV (where J is the Hunds coupling on the iron site). The 
choice of U and J are based on our previous study on the LuFeO3 system16, but all 
results remain qualitatively similar for choices of UFe >​ 4.5 eV. We used a 6 ×​ 6 ×​ 2 
k-point mesh and a kinetic-energy cut-off value of 500 eV. The Hellman–Feynman 
forces were converged to 0.001 eV Å−1. To account for the different charge orders 
(COI, COII and COIII), a 
×
3
3 supercell of the high-symmetry R m
3  cell was 
considered.
Considering optimized structures with VASP, spin–spin exchange interactions 
were estimated by fitting the Ising model with the energies of different magnetic 
configurations calculated with the linearized augmented plane-wave (LAPW) 
method as implemented in the Wien2k code49. We considered 25 magnetic 
­configurations to construct the model Hamiltonian for the high-symmetry phase 
and each charge-ordered state. To be consistent, we used the same UFe and J values 
and k-point mesh as for VASP. We used ULu = 8.8 eV and J = 0.95 eV for Lu 4f states. 
The plane-wave cut-off, which is defined as the ‘muffin tin’ radius multiplied by 
kmax, is 7.0.
For (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices, all internal parameters as well as 
out-of-plane lattice constants were fully relaxed (except for the in-plane lattice 
constant, which was fixed to the average value of the corresponding LuFeO3 and 
LuFe2O4 lattice constants, aavg = 3.46 Å). All calculations involving superlattices 
were performed in VASP.
XMCD-PEEM imaging. Magnetic imaging was performed using cryogenic PEEM 
at the Advanced Light Source at Beamline 11.0.150, taking advantage of XMCD at 
the Fe L3 edge51. Magnetic images are obtained by dividing images recorded with 
left and right circular polarization. The resulting dark and bright contrast is a 
measure of the projection of the magnetization direction on the X-ray polarization 
vector, which has a 30° angle of incidence relative to the surface of the sample.
To probe the coupling between the ferroic orders, XMCD-PEEM ­measurements 
were made on a region of the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 sample that was poled with

a PFM tip to form distinct regions of ‘up’ and ‘down’ c-oriented ferroelectric 
­polarization. The PFM poling was performed eight days before PEEM imaging to 
ensure that the polarization configuration that was imaged was robust. The PFM 
poling was performed at 300 K. In the PEEM, the sample was first cooled to 200 K 
to increase the magnetic contrast from the buried LuFe2O4 layer. As shown in 
Fig. 4b, the magnetic structure displays the same distinct pattern as the ­ferroelectric 
polarization. Finally, to confirm that the magnetic image shown in Fig. 4b could 
not be due to extrinsic effects, the sample was heated to 320 K. As shown in 
Fig. 4d, the resulting dichroism dropped by about 70%, consistent with the drop 
in the saturation magnetization between these temperatures identified in SQUID. 
Because the overall XLD contrast was constant between those two ­temperatures 
(not displayed in Fig. 2f, but acquired using the same experimental configuration) 
and any extrinsic chemical contrast would similarly be constant, this indicates 
that the strong dichroism observed at 200 K must arise from the magnetic order.

at 300 K has a distinctly different shape that is more reminiscent of the 250-K 
loop, demonstrating that ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) fluctuations still 
exist at 300 K even if the entire film is not ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic).

Extended Data Figure 4 | Neutron diffraction of the (LuFeO3)6/
(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice. a, Magnetic reflections for the (LuFeO3)6/
(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice were observed in neutron diffraction by scanning 
along the [10L] direction in reciprocal space at several temperatures 
between 5 K and 325 K. A single peak is observed showing considerable 
change in intensity between 5 K and room temperature. The offset from 
the 101 position is due to a slight misalignment of the sample. r.l.u. in  
a denotes reciprocal lattice units. b, Integrated intensity of the 101 
magnetic reflection for the (LuFeO3)6/(LuFe2O4)2 superlattice as a 
function of temperature. The solid line is the mean-field fit. Error bars  
in a and b represent one standard deviation.

Extended Data Figure 5 | HAADF-STEM images of the (LuFeO3)m/
(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices. a–d, Coloured overlays represent the local 
polarization for m = 1 (a), m = 3 (b), m = 7 (c) and m = 9 (d). Turquoise 
atoms have positive polarization and red atoms have negative polarization, 
as indicated by the colour bars. For each row of lutetium atoms, the mean 
lutetium displacement is plotted, with the bar representing the 20%–80% 
spread of the root-mean-square displacement. The colour of the bar 
indicates the direction of polarization.

Extended Data Figure 6 | Quantification of the ferroelectric 
displacements from HAADF-STEM images. After identifying the 
position of the lutetium atom with sub-ångström precision, it is  
compared to the neighbouring atoms and the displacement is calculated.  
a, Schematics of the ‘down’, ‘up’ and non-polar polarization states.  
b, Average displacement of the lutetium atoms as a function of the 
number of LuFeO3 layers m in the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 structure. The 
displacement of the end-member LuFeO3 is shown for reference; this 
displacement of 29 pm corresponds to approximately 4.3 μC cm−2. Error 
bars in a and b are s.e.m. c, A comparison of the distortion observed in the 
middle of the LuFeO3 block to those in the edge layers, for example, those 
adjacent to the LuFe2O4 bilayers. d, In situ TEM heating experiment of 
the (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)n superlattices. We infer the ferroelectric phase 
from where distortions in the lutetium rows are resolved. With increasing 
temperature, ferroelectricity disappears starting with lower m. Above 
T = 675 K, we see no ferroelectric distortions; however, the electrical noise 
in the images at these temperatures is quite large.

Extended Data Figure 7 | X-ray linear dichroic spectroscopy of the  
Fe L2,3 edge. a, b, The X-ray adsorption spectra for in-plane (blue) and 
out-of-plane (red) linearly polarized radiation are plotted in the top  
panels for the (LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1 (a) and (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)3  
(b) superlattices at 300 K. The difference between the normalized spectra 
(black, bottom panels) is also plotted for each case. For the (LuFeO3)9/
(LuFe2O4)1 sample, the peak dichroism is about 40% whereas the peak 
dichroism is only about 20% for the (LuFeO3)1/(LuFe2O4)3 superlattice.
