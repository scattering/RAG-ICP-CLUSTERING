The face-centered-cubic (fcc) lattice of Ru5+ spins in the double perovskite Sr2YRuO6 shows a delicate,
three-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state composed of stacked square AFM layers. Inelastic
neutron scattering data taken on this state reveal a gapped low-energy excitation band emerging from [001] with
spin excitations extending to 8 meV. These magnetic excitations are modeled by a simple J1-J2 interaction scheme
allowing quantitative comparisons with similar materials. At higher temperatures, the low-energy excitation
spectrum is dominated by a quasielastic component associated with size ﬂuctuations of two-dimensional AFM
clusters that exhibit asymmetric correlations even at low temperatures. Thus, the fcc lattice in general and
the double-perovskite structure in particular emerge as hosts of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
dynamics resulting from frustration.

The large number of competing ground states in geomet-
rically frustrated magnets tends to destabilize the magnetic
ordering and may lead to remarkable correlated states at
sufﬁciently low temperatures [1]. An interesting and classical
example of a frustrated magnetic geometry is the face-
centered-cubic (fcc) lattice with a dominant nearest-neighbor
antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction [2–4]. This lattice, found
in many double-perovskite [5] and spinel [6] compounds,
shows a dense population of spin tetrahedra, with triangular
faces where the spin interactions cannot be simultaneously
satisﬁed. The presence of anisotropy terms or further-neighbor
interactions in the spin Hamiltonian tends to stabilize nearly
collinear long-range magnetic structures composed of stacked
AFM square layers, where the details of the stacking depend
on higher-order terms [7–9].
The ordered double-perovskite structure with the general
composition A2BB′O6 where A = Ca, Sr, Ba, is a rich and
versatile template for exploring frustrated phenomena on the
fcc lattice. Here, the transition metal B and B′ sites form
interpenetrating fcc lattices and are amenable to a variety of
chemical compositions [5] as both sites have octahedral oxy-
gen coordination. A prototypical quasi-fcc lattice of classical
spins is Sr2YRuO6 (SYRO), which crystallizes in a quasicubic
P21/n structure with only the Ru5+ ions being magnetic in
the system (S = 3/2, L = 0) [10–13]. This material shows two
magnetic transitions, at TN2 ∼24 and TN1 ∼32 K [11,14–16].
At sufﬁciently low temperatures (T < TN2), the spins order
in the type-I AFM structure [10,11] [see Fig. 1(a)], similar
to many d3 and d5 double perovskites [5,17–21]. For TN2 <
T < TN1, a partially ordered state is observed, with long-range
ordered alternating layers coexisting with layers with short-
range correlated spins [11]. Finally, above TN1, a magnetically
correlated state is observed, with signiﬁcant correlations up
to ∼300 K [11,22]. A second magnetic structure has been
recently reported to occur between TN1 and TN2 [23], however,
no evidence of this state was observed in our previous neutron
diffraction study [11].
Related A2YRuO6 compounds with the Fm¯3m cubic space
group such as Ba2YRuO6 (BYRO) exhibit a similar phe-
nomenology to SYRO, including type-I AFM structure, double
magnetic transitions [24,25], and short-range order at high
temperatures [26], while compounds with large monoclinic
distortion such as La2NaRuO6 order with incommensurate
magnetic structures, if at all [5,27–29]. Detailed studies of the
spin-excitation spectrum of intermediate compounds such as
SYRO are therefore necessary to determine the general nature
of the spin dynamics in this class of materials and to what
extent spin-orbit effects play a signiﬁcant role in the emergent
dynamics and ground state.
The 13 g ceramic sample in this work is the same sample
employed in a previous study and was synthesized by a
solid-state reaction [11]. Neutron scattering experiments were
performed on the time-of-ﬂight Disk Chopper Spectrome-
ter (DCS) at NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)
with neutrons of incident energy Ei = 9.73 or 4.64 meV,
yielding Gaussian instrumental energy resolutions of 0.5 and
0.15 meV full widths at half maximum at the elastic position,
respectively. Additional measurements to higher energies were
performed on the BT-7 triple-axis spectrometer at the NCNR
[30] employing the horizontally focusing analyzer geometry
with a ﬁxed ﬁnal energy Ef = 14.7 meV.
Figures 1(b)–1(i) show neutron scattering intensity plots
as a function of the magnitude of the momentum transfer,
or wave vector Q, and excitation energies of SYRO at 5,
15, 22, 27.5, 35, 50, 100, and 300 K taken with an incident
neutron energy Ei = 9.73 meV. In the elastic sector (bottom
of each ﬁgure), three reﬂections are observed in the selected
Q interval at low temperatures, corresponding to the [001] and
[110] magnetic ordering wave vectors at 0.77 and 1.09 ˚A−1,
respectively, and the [111] nuclear structure wave vector at
1.32 ˚A−1. The magnetic reﬂections are those expected for
the type-I AFM structure [Fig. 1(a)] previously reported for
this material [10,11], and fade away above TN1 = 32 K, as
expected. In the inelastic sector, a dispersion band emerging
from [001] is observed at low temperatures [see Figs. 1(b) and
1(c)]. Above TN2, the excitation spectrum is dominated by a
diffusive quasielastic column above the [001] magnetic wave
vector, which persists up to at least 100 K [see Figs. 1(e)–

the wave vector and excitation energy of SYRO at 15 and
35 K, respectively. With this ﬁner resolution it is apparent that
the scattering is greatly suppressed between 0.2 and 1.5 meV
in the ordered state, demonstrating that the spin waves are
gapped below TN2. In comparison, the diffusive quasielastic
scattering at 35 K is rather strong, increasing with decreasing
energy down to the experimental limit of 0.15 meV, as expected
for correlated paramagnetism.
Figure 3(a) shows the Q dependence of the inelastic
scattering integrated between 1 and 5 meV (denoted as E =
[1,5] meV) at selected temperatures. Although the inelastic
scattering maps at 5 K and above 27.5 K are entirely different
[see Figs. 1(b) and 1(e)–1(g)], their Q dependence is rather
similar, with a broad asymmetric maximum at Q = 0.77 ˚A−1
corresponding to the [001] wave vector, while no relevant
contribution centered at Q = 1.09 ˚A−1 corresponding to the
[110] position is observed. This asymmetric line shape is
characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) behavior, similar to
that reported in our previous energy-integrated measurements
[11]. We performed ﬁts of these inelastic proﬁles with the
Warren model for scattering from uncoupled layers [31],
shown as the solid lines in Fig. 3(a), resulting in the effective
dynamical correlation length as a function of temperature in
Fig. 3(c). The correlation length ﬁrst increases gradually with
decreasing temperatures, then dramatically increases between
TN2 and TN1 with the onset of magnetic order and well-deﬁned
spin-wave scattering. The integrated inelastic scattering below
TN2 is also described by a Warren line shape, demonstrating
a slight anisotropy of the powder-averaged direction, and that
there is no stiffening of the spin-wave modes with decreased
temperature.

(dotted black). Normalized data from (b) are shown as open circles for
comparison.
Further details on the spectral weight transfer with tem-
perature are given by the energy dependence of the intensity
integrated between Q = 0.6 and 1.0 ˚A−1 (Q = [0.6,1] ˚A−1),
covering the scattering around the [001] magnetic ordering
wave vector. This is shown in Fig. 3(b) for selected tempera-
tures. At E ∼5 meV, the scattering intensity is independent
of temperature before accounting for thermal factors. Below
this energy, the scattering at 5 K is strongly suppressed when
compared to the signal at higher temperatures, corresponding
to the opening of the spin gap. The temperature dependence
of the correlations and onset of the spin gap is quantiﬁed by
integrating the low-energy portion of the scattering, E = [1,2]
meV, shown in Fig. 3(c). The low-energy intensity increases
with decreasing temperature down to TN1, following the
quasielastic scattering in Fig. 1. The sudden loss of intensity
below TN1 demonstrates that the spin gap forms concomitantly
with long-range order [11], similar to BYRO [26].
The top of the magnetic scattering band extends beyond
the 5 meV maximum energy transfer shown here. Subsequent
inelastic measurements were made on the BT-7 triple-axis
spectrometer with energy transfers up to 16 meV at a constant
Q = 1.3 ˚A−1, the lowest allowable momentum transfer for
energy in this conﬁguration with sufﬁcient resolution. The
difference between 3 and 300 K data is shown in Fig. 4(b),
after correcting for the Boltzmann temperature dependence,
to separate the contribution from the spin-wave scattering.
The rather sharp maximum at E ∼8 meV signiﬁes the
maximum in the magnon density of states (DOS). This is
similar to the energy-dependent scattering found in BYRO
[25], with a 5 meV spin gap and 14 meV maximum in the
DOS.
The magnetic structure below TN2 is well deﬁned as a
type-I AFM and thus the excitations may be modeled using
spin-wave theory to ﬁrst approximation. We employ the
simpliﬁed Hamiltonian shown in Eq. (1) considering only
nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions J1, next-nearest-neighbor
(NNN) J2, and single-ion anisotropy D, with S = 3
2 moments
on the fcc lattice. The sign of the J2 interactions and D are
ﬁxed to ensure a type-I ground state with spins lying in the
plane, as previously observed [11],

The spin-wave excitations were calculated and powder
averaged within linear spin-wave theory using the SPIN-W
package [32]. The magnetic form factor for Ru5+ is not
tabulated in standard tables and so the form determined in
Ref. [33] was used for calculations and comparison with ex-
periment. The interaction terms in Eq. (1) were determined by
least-squares ﬁtting the wave-vector-integrated and resolution-
corrected magnetic scattering simultaneously to both the BT7
and DCS data shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).
A constant background and overall scaling term were
also included in each data set while a Gaussian of ﬁxed
amplitude and width was used to account for the elastic
contribution. The resulting best ﬁt is shown as the solid lines
in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), corresponding to J1 = 0.55(5) meV,
J2 = −0.40(5) meV, and D = 0.10(3) meV, and an excellent
goodness of ﬁt χ2 = 1.6. Calculation of the scattering intensity
as a function of wave vector and energy reproduced the
DCS data quite well, as in Fig. 4(b). The apparent lack of
inelastic scattering above the [110] wave vector in Fig. 1(b), for
example, can be conclusively attributed simply to the effect of
powder averagingandrapidlyvanishingformfactor [33] which
strongly suppress the observed scattering at this position, as
suggested previously [25].
The onset of long-range magnetic order is well described
within mean-ﬁeld theory by this set of exchange parameters, as
demonstrated by Monte Carlo calculations shown in Fig. 4(e).
Using a grid of 143 unit cells (10 976 spins) the static magnetic
moment is found to follow order-parameter-like behavior when
asimulatedannealingroutineis performed, resultinginasingle
transition in both magnetization and speciﬁc heat with TN =
27.5 K, quite close to that actually observed [11]. Furthermore,
if we simply increase the magnitude of J1 to 0.75 meV, we
obtain a maximum in the spin-wave spectrum of 15 meV and
TN = 38 K, both quite close to that found in BYRO [25]. It
should be noted that only one transition is possible with this
mean-ﬁeld analysis and simple model, and it therefore cannot
capture the second transition or low-dimensional correlations
at high temperatures. However, despite the simplicity of the
J1-J2 model, it appears to capture many salient features
correctly at the mean-ﬁeld level, including the magnitude of
the exchange interactions between Ru ions.
Previous ab initio and M¨ossbauer studies have suggested
J1 on the order of 15–20 meV, with symmetric exchange

anisotropy resulting in a lower magnetic ordering temperature
[8,12,14]. However, as shown in Fig. 4(f), the integrated
magnon density of states (DOS) for this model with no
single-ion anisotropy and J2/J1 = −0.01 does not result in
a single well-deﬁned peak in this energy range, but rather
global maxima at energies well above 100 meV. An additional
model incorporating all AFM exchange interactions up to third
nearest neighbor with ﬁxed proportions recently suggested for
BYRO [26] was also examined. This resulted in a best-ﬁt J1 =
1.5 meV, on the same order of magnitude as the simple J1-J2
model, but did not produce a single maximum in the DOS,
as the J3 interactions break the degeneracy of the spin-wave
modes at higher energies. Other models incorporating different
types of further-neighbor interactions or other anisotropies
such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction could not be
reliably studied due to the polycrystalline averaging.
The suppression of inelastic scattering below TN1 corrob-
orates recent results that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is the
primary source of single-ion anisotropy in these systems
[25,28,34], leading to the observed gap in the spin-wave
spectrum. This anisotropy favors ferromagnetic alignment
of the spins within the a-b plane and alternating along the
c axis as determined from previous high-resolution powder
diffraction measurements [11]. As a result, the spin gap is
nonuniform between zone centers, similar to other single
domain type-I AFM structures [35]. Calculations of the full
spin-wave dispersion using our best-ﬁt exchange constants
reveal a spin gap of roughly 2 meV at [00q]-type reciprocal
lattice vectors and 0.5 meV for [qq0] type, resulting in the
very weak scattering below 2 meV in the powder-averaged
scattering spectra in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) and in Fig. 2(a) to a
lesser extent. In addition to SOC, distortions of the oxygen
octahedra around each Ru ion may also act to break the
degeneracy of the t2g and eg manifolds and subsequent Ru-O
bonding, which will in turn effect the relative strength of
the superexchange pathways [14]. In fact, recent systematic
studies of Ca-doped SYRO [36] have found TN1 does in fact
decrease monotonically with increasing monoclinic distortion,
in agreement with our results here. If such distortions instead
generated anisotropy in the exchange interaction matrix, one
would expect frustration to be relieved and an increased TN
[8], which is not observed.
Both the shape of the quasielastic spectra and spectral
weight transfer from excitations on cooling [see Fig. 3(d)]
provide important insight into the mechanism of the long-range
ordering transition and correlated scattering. The column
of quasielastic excitations observed above the [001] wave
vector at intermediate temperatures is characteristic of a dense
population of quasistatic correlated layers. The lowest-energy
excitations in this state are arguably related to cluster size
ﬂuctuations between planes. At sufﬁciently low temperatures,
correlated two-dimensional clusters merge and condense,
while the signal from size ﬂuctuations is suppressed, giving
rise to elastic Bragg scattering. A similar mechanism was
recently proposed to explain the diffuse scattering above TN1
in BYRO [26], but suggested the primary correlations are
quasi-one-dimensional rather than 2D, as we have shown here.
In summary, the magnetic excitations of Sr2YRuO6 were
investigated by inelastic neutron scattering. The spin dynamics
in the ordered state are adequately described within linear
spin-wave theory with exchange interaction energies far
smaller than early predictions. Observation of signiﬁcant
correlations at temperatures an order of magnitude higher than
TN1, with asymmetric linewidths, is indicative of strong 2D
correlations, demonstrating low-dimensional spin correlations
for all temperatures above TN2. Similarities with cubic BYRO
demonstrate a common exchange-interaction model among
double-perovksite ruthenates, regardless of crystallographic
distortions, in which SOC may play an important role in
establishing the magnetically ordered state in these frustrated
fcc antiferromagnets.
