The effects of high magnetic ﬁelds applied perpendicular to the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization on
single crystals of BiFeO3 were investigated through magnetization, magnetostriction, and neutron diffraction
measurements. The magnetostriction measurements revealed lattice distortion of 2 × 10−5 during the reori-
entation process of the cycloidal spin order by applied magnetic ﬁelds. Furthermore, anomalous changes in
magnetostriction and electric polarization at a larger ﬁeld demonstrate an intermediate phase between cycloidal
and canted antiferromagnetic states, where a large magnetoelectric effect was observed. Neutron diffraction
measurements clariﬁed that incommensurate spin modulation along the [110]hex direction in the cycloidal phase
becomes Q = 0 commensurate along this direction in the intermediate phase. Theoretical calculations based
on the standard spin Hamiltonian of this material suggest an antiferromagnetic cone-type spin order in the
intermediate phase.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, multiferroic materials have been widely investi-
gated due to their coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric
ordering. BiFeO3 is perhaps the most extensively studied
multiferroic material as it possesses robust multiferroicity at
room temperature as well as various possible applications
[1–10]. The effects of magnetic ﬁelds on the coupled multiple
degrees of freedom behind these phenomena are not fully
understood.
BiFeO3 has a crystal structure with the polar space group
of R3c, which is realized by displacements of ions parallel
and perpendicular to a ⟨111⟩axis of the perovskite-type cubic
structure and rotation of the FeO6 octahedra around this
axis [11]. A large switchable spontaneous electric polarization
emerges along the c axis in the hexagonal setting of the
rhombohedral cell [12–14]. Degeneracy exists in selecting
the polarization direction from eight ⟨111⟩pc (“pc” denotes
the pseudocubic) directions. Hence, depending on synthesis
methods, BiFeO3 crystals can contain multiple ferroelectric
domains [15].
BiFeO3
exhibits
a
cycloidal
magnetic
order
below
640 K [16]. This state is known to exhibit marginal quadratic
magnetoelectric (ME) effect at low magnetic ﬁelds [17]. High
magnetic ﬁelds of ∼20 T stabilize the canted antiferromagnetic
(CAFM) phase as opposed to the cycloidal phase [18–22].
Although several groups succeeded in realizing the CAFM
phase at zero ﬁeld [23–28], the ME effect in this phase at zero
ﬁeld has not been clariﬁed. In this study, several features were
observed when a magnetic ﬁeld was applied normal to the
rhombohedral c axis, which indicated that a third magnetic
phase emerged in bulk BiFeO3 between the cycloidal and
CAFM phases at approximately room temperature. We note
that throughout this paper, we shall use the hexagonal setting
of the rhombohedral cell to emphasize the true symmetry of
the crystal structure. In this indexing, the pseudocubic [111]pc
direction is parallel to the c axis of the hexagonal setting of
the rhombohedral cell.
In the cycloidal state, magnetic domains can be present
even in single ferroelectric domain crystals. The magnetic
propagation vector Q points in one of the hexagonal ⟨110⟩hex
directions ([1¯10]pc, [01¯1]pc, and [¯101]pc directions normal to
the [111]pc direction) [16] in the cycloidal spin ordered state
below ∼640 K. We deﬁne the Cartesian coordinates X, Y, and
Z as shown in Fig. 1(d), in which X and Z are parallel to
the a and c axes of the rhombohedral cell in the hexagonal
setting ([1¯10]pc and [111]pc), respectively, and Y is normal to
them. We construct this coordinate system for the convenience
of working in an orthonormal coordinate system for some
calculations. The threefold rotational symmetry around the c
axis (Z axis direction in this paper) leads to three equivalent
Qi (i = 1,2,3), as shown in Fig. 1(d). The spins rotated
primarily in the Qi-Z plane in a magnetic domain with a
given Qi.
Recently, Tokunaga et al. indicated the emergence of an
electric polarization perpendicular to the Z direction that was
controlled by magnetic ﬁelds [22]. Theoretical calculations
suggested that the cycloidal spin order in BiFeO3 could
involve electric polarization perpendicular to the Qi-Z plane
as illustrated as PT in Fig. 1(d) [29–31]. The existence of PT
indicated that threefold rotational symmetry was broken in
the cycloidal state. Therefore, BiFeO3 had lower symmetry
than R3c at room temperature. Sosnowska et al. examined the
crystal structure of BiFeO3 using synchrotron x-ray diffraction
and proposed that monoclinic distortion led to the observed
broadening of the Bragg peaks below 1038 K [32]. However,
relation between the magnetic order and the monoclinic

distortion was not clear since this broadening was observed
even at temperatures well above 640 K.
In this study we measured magnetization and magnetostric-
tion of BiFeO3 single crystals in high magnetic ﬁelds applied
normal to the pseudocubic [111]pc direction. We found spon-
taneous lattice distortion within the ab plane in the cycloidal
state and its ferroelastic response against external magnetic
ﬁelds. We also found nonmonotonic response in magnetic,
dielectric, and structural properties in the intermediate region
between the cycloidal and CAFM phases at a temperature
of 300 K. Our neutron experiments clariﬁed that the spin
modulation at the intermediate phase was different from that
in the cycloidal phase.
II. EXPERIMENT
Single ferroelectric domain crystals of BiFeO3 were syn-
thesized by the laser-diode heating ﬂoating-zone method [33].
The magnetization was measured by the induction method
using a nondestructive 55 T pulse magnet with duration
of 8 ms installed at ISSP. Newly improved capacitance
dilatometry enabled the measurement of magnetostriction
using the capacitance method [34] and a 55 T pulse magnet
with duration of 36 ms.
The neutron diffraction experiments were carried out on
the BT-7 thermal neutron triple-axis spectrometer at the NIST
Center for Neutron Research [35]. The dimensions of the rod
shaped crystal used in this study are 3.5 mm in diameter
and 10 mm in length. Neutrons with an energy of 14.7 meV
was used, together with a horizontal collimator sequence of
50′-25′-50′-120′. Contamination from higher-order beams was
effectively eliminated using pyrolytic graphite (PG) ﬁlters. The
magnetic ﬁelds were applied along the X and Y directions. The
three magnetic domains of the crystals were previously aligned
by applying magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁelds along the Y
direction align the magnetic domains to Q2 [see Fig. 1(d)]. On
the other hand, the magnetic ﬁelds along the X direction align
the magnetic domains to Q1 and Q3. The single crystals were
oriented in the (hhl)pc which is the zone deﬁned by [111]pc
and [11¯2]pc [or (0YZ)] and (hk[h + k]/2)pc deﬁned by [111]pc
and [1¯10]pc [or (X0Z)] scattering planes for the measurements
with H ∥X and H ∥Y, respectively, and were mounted in a
15 T vertical ﬁeld superconducting magnet.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1(a) shows the magnetization (M) curve at 300 K
in the magnetic ﬁeld (H) applied along the Y direction. The
kink at ∼15 T indicated the existence of a magnetic transition
at this ﬁeld [22]. Extrapolation of the linear M-H curve at
high ﬁeld to zero ﬁeld indicated ﬁnite offsets in the vertical
axis and thus suggested that the high ﬁeld phase possesses
spontaneous magnetization (MS). Figure 1(b) presents the
change in electric polarization along the Y direction (PY)
caused by a magnetic ﬁeld H ∥Y. The PY steeply changes
below 10 T in the ﬁeld increasing process of the ﬁrst ﬁeld
cycle (red). However, this change was suppressed in the
second ﬁeld cycle (blue). This irreversible change (also known
as the nonvolatile effect) was ascribed to the reorientation
of the magnetoelectric domains [9,22]. It was assumed that
the transverse electric polarization PT changed the direction
during the reorientation of the cycloidal domains to the Q2
domain in the initial ﬁeld scan.
The emergence of PY indicates that threefold rotational
symmetry was broken at 300 K. We measured the transverse
magnetostriction with H ∥Y at 300 K to detect the relevant
lattice distortion. The vertical axis in Fig. 1(c) corresponds
to the ﬁeld-induced change in the sample length along X
(L) normalized by the length at zero ﬁeld (L). The ﬁeld
dependence of L/L followed that of PY, in the opposite
sign, including the irreversible behavior below 10 T. This
measurement demonstrated that the application of a temporal
magnetic ﬁeld slightly compressed the crystal normal to
the H-Z plane. Prior to this experiment, we measured the
magnetostriction along the X direction for H ∥X while
maintaining the capacitance cell setup [insets of Fig. 1(e)].
This result is indicated by a black solid line in Fig. 1(e). In
the case of H ∥X, the crystal length along the X direction
increased. The initial position of the L/L for H ∥Y was
the same as its ﬁnal position after the application of H ∥X.
Therefore, the data for H ∥Y is plotted with the vertical
offset of 2 × 10−5. These irreversible behaviors below 10 T
indicated that the sample length changed due to the direction
of Q. A neutron experiment in a recent study conﬁrmed that
application of H ∥Y of 6 T would stabilize the Q2 domain
in Fig. 1(d) [36]. These irreversible changes demonstrate the
existence of a spontaneous slight contraction along the Q

spectively. The blue dashed lines indicate the highest ﬁeld of 14 T and

vector. This breaking of the threefold rotational symmetry is
consistent with a monoclinic crystal structure as reported in
Ref. [32]. This result is consistent with the early report of
neutron diffraction measurements showing that the population
of the magnetic domain with the Q vector normal to the
applied pressure direction decreased when uniaxial pressure
was applied along the principal axis of the pseudocubic unit
cell [37].
A systematic analysis of the data obtained after the domain
reorientation in Figs. 1(a)–1(c) indicated that all the quantities
showed nonmonotonic changes between 10 and 15 T, which
is reproducible in the ﬁrst and second ﬁeld scans. In order
to clarify this anomaly, we measured the magnetization with
H ∥X and H ∥Y at various temperatures. The results are
shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). At 150 K, the magnetization
showed a steplike change at the transition ﬁeld. Conversely,
M-H curves above 200 K showed the region with a large
gradient in the intermediate ﬁeld region. In the following, we
will refer to the magnetic phase in this intermediate region as
the IM phase. The transition from the cycloidal phase to the IM
phase was discontinuous while that from the IM phase to the
CAFM phase was continuous. The IM phase appeared from the
lower ﬁeld as the temperature increased. Figures 2(c) and 2(d)
show the phase diagram in the H-T plane determined by the
magnetization curves. As observed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), no
intrinsic differences of the transition ﬁeld between the cycloid
and the IM phases were detected in the M-H curves for H ∥X
and H ∥Y. Here characteristic ﬁelds were assigned in the
magnetization curves as the transition ﬁelds as marked by
several symbols in the inset of Fig. 2(c).
Gareeva et al. theoretically predicted the emergence of
the intermediate phase [38]. Their study proposed that an
antiferromagnetic-cone (AF-cone) phase existed between the
cycloidal and CAFM phases in the magnetic ﬁelds parallel as
well as perpendicular to the Z axis (or [111]pc direction).
The calculations suggested that the boundary between the
cycloidal and AF-cone phases corresponded to a ﬁrst order
phase transition, and this is consistent with the results of the
present study. Their calculations focused on a one-dimensional
spatially modulated spin structure along a ﬁxed direction.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider more general states in
order to determine the actual spin order in the IM phase.
We performed calculations starting with the following spin

Here i, j and x, y, z represent the Fe sites and three adjacent
directions in the pseudocubic cell as shown in Fig. 3(c),
respectively. J1 and J2 represent nearest and next-nearest
neighbor interaction. D, D′, and K denote DM interactions
and single-ion anisotropy. Figure 3(a) shows the energy of
several phases as a function of magnetic ﬁeld applied normal to
the Z direction. Here we used S = 5/2, J1 = 5.32 meV, J2 =
0.24 meV, D = −0.15 meV, D′ = 0.1 meV, K = 0.0055 meV,
and g = 2, which are slightly tuned from the values in
Refs. [39–41]. Using these parameters, an intermediate (IM)
phase is stabilized between the cycloidal and CAFM phases.
The IM phase shows an AF cone-type spin structure with the
propagation vector pointing to the ﬁeld direction as shown in
Fig. 3(c). In the present Hamiltonian, the D terms stabilize
the cycloidal state, while the D′ term favors the CAFM one.
The AF cone state is a kind of the superposition of these two
orders caused by the competition of these two DM interactions.
Figure 3(b) shows calculated magnetization curves for the
three phases. The gradual increase in magnetization for the IM
phase reproduces the experimentally observed change in the
slope shown in Fig. 2(b).

FIG. 3. Calculated magnetic ﬁeld dependencies of (a) energy per
site and (b) magnetization in the cycloidal, intermediate (IM), and
CAFM phases. (c) Schematic drawing of the AF-cone spin structure
expected in the IM phase. Closed and open circles represent Fe
sites which differ by (c/6) along the Z axis. Red arrows represent
the spin moments. x, y, and z denote three adjacent directions in
the pseudocubic unit cell. The propagation vector QAF-cone becomes
parallel to the ﬁeld H ex applied in the Y direction.
In this AF-cone state, spin susceptibility along the spin
modulation vector will be larger than that normal to it.
Accordingly, a ﬂop of the modulation vector can be caused
by the transition from the cycloidal to the AF-cone state.
Therefore, we performed neutron diffraction measurements of
BiFeO3 to study the ﬁeld dependence of the spin modulation
through this transition. We performed scans along the X
direction at 285 K under applied H ∥Y. The data were taken as
we ramped up the magnetic ﬁeld and these scans are shown in
Fig. 4(a). As the ﬁeld increases, the incommensurate peaks
at h ∼±0.004 are reduced in intensity, while in contrast,
the commensurate peak at h = 0 grows. In Fig. 4(b) we
show the ﬁeld dependence of the integrated intensities of
the commensurate and incommensurate peaks. At 285 K,
application of 14 T was sufﬁcient to reach the IM phase, but
insufﬁcient to reach the CAFM phase, at this temperature as
denoted by a cross point of vertical and horizontal dashed
lines in Fig. 2(d). An increase in magnetic ﬁelds from ∼6 T
led to a gradual increase and decrease in the commensurate
and incommensurate scattering intensities, respectively. The
propagation vector along the X direction becomes QX = 0
in the IM phase realized at 14 T. By using the results of
the present study, it is not possible to conclude whether the
spin structure was commensurate or incommensurate along
the Y direction due to the limited resolution out of the
scattering plane, as shown in Figs. 4(e)–4(g). A decrease in
the magnetic ﬁeld resulted in the change from the commen-
surate state to the incommensurate one showing hysteresis. In
the transition region, where the hysteresis is observed, we also
tried to ﬁt the data with only incommensurate peaks, whose
incommensurability reduces with increasing magnetic ﬁeld.
However, the model could not ﬁt the peak proﬁles properly.
The coexistence of commensurate/incommensurate scattering
supports the conclusion that the transition from the cycloidal
phase to the IM phase is ﬁrst order. The disappearance of the
incommensurate spin modulation along the X direction in the
FIG. 4. Proﬁles oftheneutrondiffraction(a)alongthe X direction

and solid lines are the experimental data and the ﬁts to the data,
respectively. The error bars are smaller than the symbol size, but
correspond to one standard deviation. Relative integrated intensities

and (g) antiferromagnetic cone structures in H ∥Y. The solid points
represent the peak positions. The ellipsoid shows the instrumental
resolution.
IM phase did not contradict the picture of the AF-cone phase
as shown in Fig. 3(c). We also performed neutron diffraction
measurements at 300 K in magnetic ﬁelds applied along
[1¯10]pc (or X) direction with the scattering plane of (hhl)pc. As
shown in Fig. 4(c), the incommensurate peaks at h ∼±0.0074,
which come from magnetic domains Q1 and Q3, become
less intense above 9 T. At the same time, the commensurate
peak develops. Field dependence of the integrated intensities
of the commensurate and incommensurate peaks is plotted
in Fig. 4(d). The volume fraction of the intermediate phase
becomes almost 100% at 14 T in the ramping up process.
This critical ﬁeld is consistent with that obtained from the
magnetization measurements. This result is also similar to that
measured with magnetic ﬁeld along the Y.
In the IM phase, magnetization, electric polarization, and
magnetostriction changed linearly as a function of magnetic
ﬁeld. The coefﬁcient of the linear ME effect between 12 and
15 T shown in Fig. 1(b) is approximately 210 ps/m. Although
we cannot identify this value determined in a limited ﬁeld
region as the representative one in the IM phase, the observed
slope in the P-H curve in the IM phase is approximately 50
times steeper than that in the CAFM phases. The linear ME
effect in the IM phase is about 400 times larger than that in the
standard material Cr2O3 [42].

PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS 1, 024408 (2017)
Thus far we have not succeeded in reproducing the ME
effect in the IM phase based on the generalized inverse
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya effect [30]. Phenomenologically, the
ME effect might be explained by slight tilting of the hexagonal
c axis by the monoclinic distortion. Using the reported lattice
parameters [32], we determined that the tilting angle was
θ = 0.01◦–0.04◦(see the Appendix). According to a recent
x-ray and neutron study on ∼1 μm thick single ferroelectric
domain ﬁlms of BiFeO3, similar tilting of the hexagonal
c axis by 0.030◦± 0.005◦was observed orthogonal to the
Q vector [43]. Assuming a spontaneous polarization of 1 C/m2
along the c axis, the projected component will be between 200
and 800 μC/m2, which is the same order of magnitude with
the observed transverse component. The important point here
is that the tilting is coupled to the spin system, and hence can
be controlled by an external magnetic ﬁeld.
Finally, the study involved examining ways to realize the
IM phase at lower magnetic ﬁelds than the ﬁelds observed in
this study. In accordance with the Landau-Ginzburg theory for
BiFeO3, exchange stiffness, DM interaction, effective mag-
netic anisotropy constant (κc), differential magnetic suscepti-
bility (χ⊥), and spontaneous magnetization in the CAFM phase
(MS) are fundamental parameters. Among these parameters,
χ⊥and MS were determined from the experimental results of
the M-H curves. Figure 2(e) shows the temperature depen-
dence of these parameters determined from the magnetization
curves at various temperatures. These parameters were almost
constant at temperatures from 150 to 320 K. The temperature
dependence of the transition ﬁeld to the IM phase could be
a result of the change in κc because the exchange stiffness
and DM interaction are likely insensitive to temperature.
According to a theoretical study [38], when κc changed
toward easy-plane type while holding the other parameters
constant, the transition ﬁeld to the AF-cone phase was reduced.
Therefore, future research could examine the AF-cone phase
in thin ﬁlms that have easy-plane type anisotropy [28].
IV. CONCLUSION
In summary, magnetization, magnetostriction, and neutron
diffraction measurements were performed on BiFeO3 single
crystals in magnetic ﬁelds applied normal to the pseudocu-
bic [111]pc direction. The observations indicated that the
reorientation of multiferroic domains occurred below 10 T
in conjunction with irreversible ﬁeld-induced change in the
lattice distortion. This demonstrated the existence of a mono-
clinic distortion in the cycloidal phase. The application of an
increased magnetic ﬁeld realized an intermediate phase prior
to the transition to the canted antiferromagnetic state. A large
ME effect was observed in this intermediate phase. Theoretical
calculations indicated the presence of an antiferromagnetic
cone-type spin order in this phase, consistent with the neutron
diffraction measurements.

APPENDIX: ESTIMATION OF THE TRANSVERSE
POLARIZATION CAUSED BY THE TILTING
SPONTANEOUS ELECTRIC POLARIZATION
In the monoclinic phase, c axis in the hexagonal unit tilts
toward one direction, which causes the transverse component
of the electric polarization Ptilt along this direction. Here we
estimate this component using the lattice parameters reported
in Ref. [32]. Similar to this literature, we use the following
setting of the unit vectors:
a0
h = −3
2 a0
m −1
2 b0
m −c0
m,
b0
h = 3
2 a0
m −1
2 b0
m + c0
m,
c0
h = c0
m,
(A1)
where ah, bh, and ch (am, bm, and cm) are the unit vectors in
the hexagonal (monoclinic) unit cell. Here the superscripts 0
represent the vectors without monoclinic distortion. Therefore,
a0
h × b0
h is parallel to the c0
h. Monoclinic distortion changes
the length of these vectors. The resultant tilting angle of the
hexagonal c axis can be evaluated as
θP = cos−1 (ah × bh) · ch
|ah × bh||ch|
= cos−1
3am sin β

9a2m + 4c2m + 12amcm cos β
,
(A2)
where β is the angle between am and cm. Using the reported
parameters, we calculated the θP for several samples as shown
in Table I. The transverse component of electric polarization
Ptilt is given as
Ptilt = PS sin θP .
(A3)
Thus calculated values of Ptilt for spontaneous polarization of
PS = 1 C/m2 are listed in Table I. In addition,
ah × bh =
3
2 am + cm
	
× bm.
(A4)
Therefore, ch tilts around bm. Since bm ∼b0
m = −a0
h −b0
h ∥
Q1, Ptilt emerges normal to the Q1.
