The low-temperature magnetic phases in the layered honeycomb lattice material α-RuCl3 have been studied as
a function of in-plane magnetic ﬁeld. In zero ﬁeld this material orders magnetically below 7 K with a so-called
zigzag order within the honeycomb planes. Neutron diffraction data show that a relatively small applied ﬁeld
of 2 T is sufﬁcient to suppress the population of the magnetic domain in which the zigzag chains run along the
ﬁeld direction. We found that the intensity of the magnetic peaks due to zigzag order is continuously suppressed
with increasing ﬁeld until their disappearance at μoHc = 8 T. At still higher ﬁelds (above 8 T) the zigzag order
is destroyed, while bulk magnetization and heat capacity measurements suggest that the material enters a state
with gapped magnetic excitations. We discuss the magnetic phase diagram obtained in our study in the context
of a quantum phase transition.

The transition metal halide α-RuCl3 has a crystal structure
made up of stacked honeycomb layers of edge-sharing RuCl6
octahedra. Plumb et al. [1] found that spin-orbit coupling
in this material is substantial, leading to a jeff = 1
2 state
description of the Ru3+ valence electrons. Since this material
is built up with edge-sharing RuCl6 octahedra, its spin Hamil-
tonian is believed to include a signiﬁcant bond-dependent
Kitaev interaction [2,3], making α-RuCl3 a material of great
interest in the ongoing search for a Kitaev spin-liquid ground
state [4–23]. Although α-RuCl3 orders magnetically at low
temperature with zigzag magnetic order [24–27], this material
has shown some signatures of spin-liquid physics, such as
a broad continuum of magnetic excitations identiﬁed in
both Raman scattering [28] and inelastic neutron scattering
measurements [25,29].
When a magnetic ﬁeld is applied within the honeycomb
plane, previous bulk measurements have reported that α-RuCl3
undergoes a number of transitions [26,30–32], including low-
ﬁeld transitions resembling spin-ﬂop transitions occurring at
1 T and 6 T, followed by the apparent loss of zigzag magnetic
order at 8 T. In contrast, when a magnetic ﬁeld is applied
perpendicular to the honeycomb planes the zigzag magnetic
order appears to be robust up to ﬁelds of 14 T [31]. The
high-ﬁeld phase above the loss of zigzag magnetic order has
been the subject of particular interest recently [26,30–33]. It
has been proposed that this phase may be a simple polarized
paramagnetic state [26]; however, this does not account for
the lack of saturation in the magnetization [30]. The high-ﬁeld
phase has also been characterized by NMR measurements [32]
which show that the magnetic excitations develop an energy
gap. The gap size was similar for the two ﬁeld directions
measured, a result difﬁcult to reconcile with the physics
of a polarized paramagnetic state. This ﬁnding of gapped
excitations in the high-ﬁeld phase is in contrast to recent
thermal conductivity measurements [33] which suggested the
presence of gapless excitations in the high-ﬁeld phase.

In this paper, we have characterized these ﬁnite ﬁeld
transitions using magnetic neutron diffraction, and bulk
heat capacity and magnetization measurements on the same
samples. Neutron diffraction measurements show that at low
ﬁeld (2 T) the diffracted intensity due to one of the zigzag
domains disappears, suggesting that redistribution in domain
population occurs in this rather low ﬁeld range. We found
that the zigzag magnetic order temperature Tc is continuously
suppressed with applied ﬁeld and eventually disappears above
the critical in-plane ﬁeld of μoH c = 8 T [34]. The high-ﬁeld
phase above the critical ﬁeld is characterized by a magnetic
excitation gap  which can be extracted from the speciﬁc
heat data. The energy scales both below (Tc) and above ()
the critical ﬁeld exhibit power-law scaling as a function of
in-plane magnetic ﬁeld, indicating the presence of a quantum
critical point. We note that the quantum phase transition due
to the transverse ﬁeld in the Ising model provides a reasonable
phenomenological description of the observed phase diagram.
Single crystals of α-RuCl3 were grown from commercial
RuCl3 powder (Sigma-Aldrich, Ru content 45%–55%) by
vacuum sublimation in sealed quartz tubes. This resulted in
ﬂat, platelike crystals with typical dimensions 1–2 mm2 and
mass 1–5 mg. The crystallographic c direction (hexagonal
notation) was found to be perpendicular to the large surface of
the crystal. Throughout this paper we will use the hexagonal
crystallographic notation with a = 5.96 ˚A and c = 17.2 ˚A,
in which the a-b plane coincides with the honeycomb layers.
The crystals have well-deﬁned facets at 120◦angles, and it was
found that the facets coincide with the hexagonal (1,1,0)-type
directions.
Neutron diffraction measurements were carried out using
the BT-7 triple-axis spectrometer at the NIST Center for
Neutron Research (NCNR) [36]. The neutron diffraction data
were collected using a crystal array of 60 crystals with a mass
of 100 mg. The incident neutron energy was 14.7 meV, and
measurements were conducted in the (H0L) plane as well as
the plane containing the (0, 0.5, 2) and (–0.5, 0.5, 2) magnetic
Bragg peaks. In both cases magnetic ﬁelds up to 15 T were
applied perpendicular to the scattering plane using either a
10-T or a 15-T vertical ﬁeld superconducting magnet. In order

FIG. 1. (a) Low-ﬁeld magnetic peak intensity at 2 K as a function of the in-plane component of magnetic ﬁeld (μo ˜H). The intensity is
normalized to the value at zero ﬁeld. The inset shows individual scans of (0.5,0,1) and (0,0.5,2) Bragg peaks at 0, 1, and 1.6 T (in-plane ﬁeld)
and 2 K. (b) High-ﬁeld intensity of the (0,0.5,2) peak at 2 K, 5 K, and 6 K. Solid lines are ﬁts with ∼(H −Hc)2β∗to extract the critical ﬁeld.
The same critical exponent β∗= 0.28 was used for all three curves. Error bars where indicated represent one standard deviation.
to gain access to the (0,0.5,2) magnetic peak, it was necessary
to rotate the sample such that the angle between the magnetic
ﬁeld and and the honeycomb plane was approximately 35◦. In
this case, we quote the in-plane component of the ﬁeld ˜H rather
than the total ﬁeld applied. For all the other measurements, the
magnetic ﬁeld was applied within the honeycomb plane.
Magnetization and heat capacity were measured as a func-
tion of temperature using a physical property measurement
system (PPMS) with ﬁelds up to 14 T. The magnetization
measurements were conducted on a collection of six crystals
mounted with the ﬁeld applied along the in-plane (–1,2,0)
direction. The heat capacity measurements were done with a
single crystal mounted vertically on an aluminum oxide mount
in the same orientation as that used for the magnetization
measurements. The phonon contribution to heat capacity was
subtracted using the nonmagnetic isostructural α-IrCl3 [37].
We have investigated the magnetic transitions directly by
measuring the magnetic Bragg peak intensity as a function of
ﬁeld. When the magnetic ﬁeld was applied perpendicular to the
H0L plane, all the magnetic peaks in this plane—(±0.5,0,l)
with l = 1,2,4—decreased in intensity and disappeared at the
relatively low magnetic ﬁeld of 2 T. The sample was then
rotated to gain access to the (0,0.5,2) magnetic peak, which was
found to increase in intensity over this ﬁeld range, as shown
in Fig. 1(a). The critical ﬁeld for this transition is in rough
correspondence with the low-ﬁeld transition observed in bulk
measurements and previously interpreted as a spin-ﬂop–type
transition, which traditionally refers to a reorientation of spins
perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld in an antiferromagnet [30].
In our experiment, the direction perpendicular to the applied
ﬁeld corresponds to the hexagonal (1,0,0) direction, which is
not one of the easy axes. We also note that a spin-ﬂop transition
still preserves the magnetic ordering wave vector, even though
magnetic Bragg peak intensities will be modiﬁed. Therefore,
a spin-ﬂop transition is not compatible with our observation
of the disappearance of all magnetic Bragg peaks in the H0L
plane. This unexpected ﬁnding can be explained as a result of
a change in magnetic domain population.
Zigzag magnetic order can be described as ferromagnetic
zigzag chains, running along the so-called zigzag direction
of a honeycomb lattice, coupled antiferromagnetically. The
undistorted honeycomb lattice possesses a threefold symmetry
which is broken in the monoclinic structure previously re-
ported for α-RuCl3 at room temperature [26]. We note that the
low-temperature structure is still a matter of some uncertainty,
with both monoclinic and trigonal structures reported [12,27].
A detailed discussion of crystal structure is, however, outside
the scope of this work, and we do not assume the presence or
absence of threefold symmetry in a single-domain crystallite.
Even in the absence of threefold symmetry for a single layer,
in large crystals or in multicrystal arrays it is probable that all
three magnetic domains will be present. The three magnetic
domains contribute to diffraction intensity in different regions
of reciprocal space as shown in Fig. 2, and the disappearance
of the peaks in the H0L plane is well explained by the
disappearance of domain 1, as shown in Fig. 2. The increase
in intensity for the (0,0.5,2) magnetic peak belonging to
domain 2 is expected for a redistribution of domain population
from domain 1 into domains 2 and 3. We conﬁrmed that the
domain 3 population increases with ﬁeld as well (not shown).
We note that this “domain reorientation” occurs gradually
with ﬁeld and reaches equilibrium above about 2 T. The
observed gradual ﬁeld dependence is also consistent with this
change coming from domain population change, as spin-ﬂop
transitions tend to be ﬁrst order when the ﬁeld is parallel to the
spin direction. Above this “domain-reorientation” transition,

FIG. 2. Magnetic structures and Bragg peak positions in the ﬁrst

In a vertical magnetic ﬁeld the intensities due to domain 1 disappeared
and intensities due to domain 2 increased. Note that the moments are
shown pointing along the zigzag direction for illustrative purposes
only. Drawings of magnetic structure were done in VESTA 3 [35].
the magnetic Bragg peak shows little change in intensity
up to 6 T. Above 6 T the intensity begins to decrease and
disappears entirely above μoHc ≈8 T, directly conﬁrming
that zigzag magnetic order disappears above a critical in-plane
ﬁeld of approximately 8 T. This transition is continuous as a
function of magnetic ﬁeld. The zigzag order parameter
√
I,
where I is the intensity of the (0,0.5,2) peak, exhibits power-
law behavior
√
I ≈(H −Hc)β∗with β∗= 0.28 ± 0.05. This
power-law behavior seems to hold for higher temperature data
as well, although the critical ﬁeld Hc shifts to lower ﬁeld with
increasing temperature.
Heat capacity and magnetization data collected at zero
magnetic ﬁeld both show signatures of the zigzag magnetic
ordering at low temperature. The heat capacity at zero
magnetic ﬁeld shows a sharp feature at 6.5 K and a second,
smaller feature at around 9 K [Fig. 3(a)]. The magnetic Bragg
peaks observed by neutron diffraction in our samples show an
ordering temperature of about 7–8 K [24], so we attribute the
lower temperature feature to this zigzag ordering. The nature
of the 9-K feature seen in our samples is not known, but Cao
et al. reported that stacking disorder in α-RuCl3 can increase
the ordering temperature to approximately 14 K [25,27], and
it is plausible to suppose that the 9-K transition observed in
our sample arises from a grain with a different stacking order.
As ﬁeld is increased, the sharp feature in the heat capacity
decreases in size before shifting to lower temperature and
becoming difﬁcult to resolve, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Magneti-
zation data at low ﬁeld show a sharp drop upon decreasing
temperature below 7 K as the crystal enters the ordered
phase. Figure 3(b) shows that this drop becomes smaller in
size and eventually disappears at high ﬁeld once the zigzag
magnetic ordering has disappeared. In the high-ﬁeld phase the
heat capacity no longer shows any sharp feature but instead
shows a broad feature that increases in temperature with
increasing magnetic ﬁeld [Fig. 3(c)]. The low-temperature
heat capacity data were ﬁt using an expression for activated
behavior (Ae−/T ) to extract the magnetic excitation gap .

expected for gapless excitations was also examined and found
to provide a poorer ﬁt of the data. This discussion is included
in the Supplemental Material [38]. The magnetization in the
high-ﬁeld phase shown in Fig. 3(d) increases gradually with
decreasing temperature, reaching ﬁeld-dependent saturation
values at low temperature.
The experimental results are summarized in Fig. 4, which
combines neutron and bulk measurements to determine the
phase diagram. The low-ﬁeld transition was found to be a
change in magnetic domain population, separating phases
made up of three and two magnetic domains (phases ZZ3
and ZZ2, respectively). The loss of magnetic order above the
high-ﬁeld transition was also conﬁrmed, although the nature
of the high-ﬁeld phase remains to be clariﬁed. The magnetic
excitation gap in the high-ﬁeld phase was characterized by
ﬁtting low-temperature heat capacity data. The gap size scales
with magnetic ﬁeld, going to zero at ﬁnite ﬁeld rather than
at zero ﬁeld, as would be expected for a simple polarized
paramagnetic state. This ﬁnding is consistent with the NMR
measurements reported previously [32] but contrasts with
the results of thermal conductivity measurements, which
suggested the presence of gapless excitations [33].

FIG. 4. In-plane ﬁeld-temperature phase diagram. ZZ3: Zigzag
magnetic order with three equal domain populations; ZZ2: zigzag
magnetic order with redistributed (two) domain population; QPM:
quantum disordered phase with gapped magnetic excitations; PM:
paramagnetic phase. The phase boundary between ZZ2 and PM is
the transition temperature Tc obtained from heat capacity and neutron
measurements. The thick solid line is from the transverse-ﬁeld Ising
model, and the thin solid line is ﬁt with a power law as described in
the text. The value of  found from the heat capacity data is also
shown (right-hand axis), and the dashed line is a power law ﬁt to the
gap size .
The observation of vanishing energy scales toward a critical
ﬁeld in both high- and low-ﬁeld regimes is strongly suggestive
of quantum critical behavior. Although detailed analysis of
the spin Hamiltonian of α-RuCl3 is beyond the scope of this
paper, the phase diagram could be understood heuristically by
comparing our results with one of the simplest models that goes
through a quantum phase transition: the transverse-ﬁeld Ising
model (TFIM). There is also physical motivation for our choice
of transverse-ﬁeld Ising model. α-RuCl3 does show a large
uniaxial anisotropy, and the magnetic ﬁeld in our experimental
setup has a large component transverse to the easy axis. This
is a result of the domain-reorientation transition, which favors
domains in which the zigzag chain directions are perpendicular
to the ﬁeld direction. The moment direction has been found
to point along the zigzag direction (neglecting a small out-
of-plane component) [27], resulting in a phase with magnetic
ﬁeld nearly perpendicular to the moment directions.
In Fig. 4, we compare the phase boundary with the TFIM
mean-ﬁeld result and ﬁnd that they are in good agreement
in the region close to Hc. We could also ﬁt Tc(H) using a
power law with Tc(H) ≈(Hc −H)0.18, as shown in the ﬁgure.
Above the critical ﬁeld, the gap follows a power-law scaling
 ≈(H −H ∗
c )zν with zν ≈1. Note that the critical ﬁeld value
extrapolated from this scaling H ∗
c ≈6.5 T is slightly different
from the critical ﬁeld μoHc ≈8 T. This discrepancy may be
due to the complex nature of the Hamiltonian of the real
material or indicates the necessity of another parameter that
needs to be tuned to reach the quantum critical point that exists
away from the T −H plane. We note that the critical exponent
relation zν = 1 is consistent with the d = 2 Ising model [39].
In addition, in Fig. 1(b), the magnetic order parameter could
be ﬁtted well using the critical exponent β∗= 0.28, which
is close to the theoretical value of 0.32 [40]. Finally, the
low-temperature saturation behavior observed in Fig. 3(d)
is naturally explained by the temperature dependence of the
transverse magnetization in the TFIM.
In conclusion, we have determined the high-ﬁeld phase
diagram for α-RuCl3 using neutron diffraction, magnetization,
and heat capacity measurements. We have conﬁrmed the loss
of zigzag order in the high-ﬁeld phase and found that the
material enters into a phase with gapped magnetic excitations.
The experimentally determined energy scales represented by
the magnetic ordering temperature for ﬁelds below the critical
ﬁeld and the energy gap above the critical ﬁeld, both show
power-law scaling behavior and vanish towards the critical
ﬁeld, indicating a ﬁeld-driven quantum phase transition. We
found that the phase diagram and the critical behavior are
qualitatively similar to that expected for the transverse-ﬁeld
Ising model.
Note added in proof. After submission of this manuscript,
several papers exploring the behavior of α-RuCl3 in a magnetic
ﬁeld have been posted on the arXiv server. These papers report
nuclear magnetic resonance [41], thermal conductivity [42],
and low-temperature heat capacity measurements [43] of this
material in a magnetic ﬁeld.

[34] We conﬁne our discussion only to magnetic ﬁelds applied within
the honeycomb plane. Justiﬁcation for this is purely empirical.
Large anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility measurements and
high-ﬁeld magnetization indicates that the easy axis is within the
honeycomb plane. However, a recent neutron diffraction study
reported that the ordered moment has components perpendicular
to the plane. We are only concerned with magnetic behavior
projected to the honeycomb plane in this paper.
