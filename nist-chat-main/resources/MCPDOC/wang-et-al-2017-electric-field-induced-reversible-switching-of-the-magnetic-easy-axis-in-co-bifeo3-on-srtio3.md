ABSTRACT: Electric-ﬁeld (E-ﬁeld) control of magnetism enabled by multiferroic materials
has the potential to revolutionize the landscape of present memory devices plagued with high
energy dissipation. To date, this E-ﬁeld controlled multiferroic scheme has only been
demonstrated at room temperature using BiFeO3 ﬁlms grown on DyScO3, a unique and
expensive substrate, which gives rise to a particular ferroelectric domain pattern in BiFeO3.
Here, we demonstrate reversible electric-ﬁeld-induced switching of the magnetic state of the
Co layer in Co/BiFeO3 (BFO) (001) thin ﬁlm heterostructures fabricated on (001) SrTiO3
(STO) substrates. The angular dependence of the coercivity and the remanent magnetization
of the Co layer indicates that its easy axis reversibly switches back and forth 45° between the
(100) and the (110) crystallographic directions of STO as a result of alternating application
of positive and negative voltage pulses between the patterned top Co electrode layer and the
(001) SrRuO3 (SRO) layer on which the ferroelectric BFO is epitaxially grown. The
coercivity (HC) of the Co layer exhibits a hysteretic behavior between two states as a function
of voltage. A mechanism based on the intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic BFO
involving projection of antiferromagnetic G-type domains is used to explain the observation. We have also measured the exact
canting angle of the G-type domain in strained BFO ﬁlms for the ﬁrst time using neutron diﬀraction. These results suggest a
pathway to integrating BFO-based devices on Si wafers for implementing low power consumption and nonvolatile
magnetoelectronic devices.

lectric-ﬁeld control of magnetism by integrating a
multiferroic material is widely being pursued because of
its potential in spintronic applications with reduced energy
dissipation due to the intrinsic coupling between magnetic and
ferroelectric (FE) order parameters in multiferroic materials.1−9
As the only known single-phase multiferroic material that
exhibits both ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
order parameters at room temperature,10,11 BFO has attracted
great attention. It has been demonstrated that the AFM state of
BFO ﬁlms can be reversibly changed with an E-ﬁeld due to the
coupling between its FE polarization and AFM spins.12,13 The
manipulation of the AFM state in BFO, in turn, can be used to
inﬂuence the properties of an adjacent ferromagnetic (FM)
layer through exchange coupling at the interface between the
AFM BFO layer and the FM layer.14−17
Taking advantage of the magnetoelectric coupling and
exchange coupling, Heron et al. have demonstrated a 180°
reversible switching of the magnetization of CoFe in CoFe/
BFO heterostructures as the E-ﬁeld is applied horizontally or
vertically through the BFO ﬁlms.1,2 Their ﬁndings have shown
that the switching of magnetization is directly associated with
the FE domain structure of BFO ﬁlms deposited on DyScO3
(DSO) substrates which only display one set of FE stripe
domains. In the present work, by using BFO ﬁlms grown on
SrTiO3 (STO) substrates, we demonstrate reversible 45°
switching of the magnetic easy axis in the Co layer exchange

coupled to BFO by applying alternating vertical voltage pulses.
We show that, concomitant with the switching, the coercivity of
the Co layer is reversibly tunable between two states. A key
diﬀerence between the reported work on BFO ﬁlms fabricated
on DSO substrates and our work on BFO ﬁlms fabricated on
STO substrates is the diﬀerence in the switching behavior of
the ferroelectric polarization, leading to the diﬀerent switching
angle of the ferromagnetic magnetization of the Co layer. This
new switching mechanism in the present work was previously
overlooked, and because it does not rely on a unique
ferroelectric domain structure of BFO on DSO, it is more
generic, and it can be extended to STO grown on Si since STO
ﬁlm can be epitaxially grown on Si substrate by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). Once STO ﬁlm is grown on Si, SRO/BFO can
be epitaxially grown on Si with an epitaxial buﬀer layer of
STO.18−20 SRO/BFO layers grown by sputtering have also
been previously demonstrated.21 Thus, the present work is an
important step toward epitaxial BFO-based E-ﬁeld tunable spin-
valve devices integrated on Si.
Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured on 100 μm × 100
μm and 200 μm × 200 μm Co pads at room temperature using
a longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr eﬀect (LMOKE) setup. To
enhance the signal/noise ratio of the LMOKE response from
each of the patterned pads, hysteresis loops were averaged over
10−15 measurements. Figure 1 shows typical hysteresis loops
of a 100 μm × 100 μm Co pad on an 80 nm thick BFO ﬁlm
with the magnetic ﬁeld applied along the STO (100) direction
(black loop) and the STO (010) direction (red loop). The
magnetic in-plane coercivity (HC) is approximately 11 mT and
7.5 mT, and the remanence ratio (MR/MS) is 0.85 and 0.6
when the ﬁeld is applied along (100) and (010) directions,
respectively. The HC of the Co layer is larger than that of Co
ﬁlms directly deposited on STO substrates (≈1.5 mT),
indicating that a robust exchange coupling is established
between the FM Co and the AFM BFO layer. However, the
exchange bias ﬁeld (HE), i.e., the shift of the hysteresis loop
along the ﬁeld axis, is quite small with an upper limit of 0.3 mT.
The small exchange ﬁeld could be due to the small
antiferromagnetic anisotropy of BFO ﬁlms,22,23 and this is
consistent with previous reports of the exchange bias ﬁeld of
CoFe layers on BFO ﬁlms where BFO heterostructures with
stripe FE domain structures show a relatively small exchange
bias ﬁeld and the observed exchange coupling was attributed to
nanoscale domain walls in the BFO ﬁlms with stripe-like
ferroelectric (FE) domains.14
To determine the direction of the easy axis of the Co layer
and investigate the E-ﬁeld eﬀect on its magnetization state, the
angular dependence of the hysteresis loop was measured using
LMOKE relative to the (100) or the (010) direction of the
BFO/STO in the as-deposited state and after the voltage pulses
were applied. The voltage pulses, ±3.5 V corresponding to
±400 kV/cm, were applied vertically to the BFO layer between
a bottom SRO electrode and a Co pad, and after each voltage
pulse, the angle-dependent MOKE hysteresis loop was
measured. From the measured hysteresis loops, the HC and
the MR/MS can be mapped at angles relative to the (100) or the
(010) direction of STO. A schematic view of the device is
shown in the inset of Figure 1.
Figure 2 shows the angular dependence of HC and MR/MS in
the as-deposited state (a, e), after the ﬁrst +400 kV/cm poling
(b, f), after the subsequent −400 kV/cm (c, g), and after the
second +400 kV/cm poling (d, h). ±400 kV/cm corresponds
to ±3.5 V, and for each poling, the voltage is applied for
approximately 10 s. The HC and the MR/MS both reach maxima
at 0° (and 180°) and minima at 90° (and 270°) in the as-grown
state (a and e), indicating that the easy and the hard axes of the
Co pad are along the (100) and the (010) crystallographic axes
of the STO layer (i.e., 0° and 90° in the polar curves),
respectively. (We note that because the (100) direction and the
(010) direction here are equivalent, for a given device, we
denote the initial easy axis direction as the (100) direction.)
The polar curves have the typical shapes of angular dependence
of the HC and the MR/MS in a conventional ferromagnet/
antiferromagnet exchange-biased system.24,25
After a positive voltage (+400 kV/cm) pulse was applied to
the same pad, the HC and the MR/MS now exhibit their maxima
and minima at 45° and 135°, respectively (Figure 2b and f).
The results suggest that, after the E-ﬁeld poling, the easy and
hard axes are now located at 45° and 135°, respectively. The
easy axis now is along the (110) or (−110) directions. As
shown in Figure 2c and g, after applying a −400 kV/cm E-ﬁeld
pulse on the same sample pad, the easy and the hard axes
switch back to 0° and 90°, respectively, which are the starting
crystallographic (100) and (010) directions of the STO ﬁlm.
Figure 2d and h show the angular dependence of HC and MR/
MS after the second positive E-ﬁeld pulse (+400 kV/cm) was
applied. The easy axis has once again rotated 45°.
The results here clearly demonstrate that the easy axis of the
Co layer reversibly switches back and forth with applied
polarity-alternating E-ﬁeld pulses. This indicates that there is
reversible change in the AFM domains of the BFO ﬁlm, which
determines the exchange bias and its direction in the Co layer.
The AFM domains are in turn directly associated with the FE
polarization of the BFO ﬁlm.13
It has been explained theoretically that, in strained BFO ﬁlms
with stripe domains, there are G-type AFM domains with local
AFM moments oriented in the (111) planes with canted
moments in the (11−2) direction.2,26 It is the projection of this
canted moment to the surface of the ﬁlm which leads to
exchange bias. There have previously been numerous
experimental reports on investigation of the magnetic structure
of BFO ﬁlms by neutron diﬀraction.27−30 The general
consensus is that, in strained ﬁlms much thinner than 500
nm, there are G-type AFM domains, while when the ﬁlms get
thicker, cycloids begin to appear. We note that, due to the
subtle diﬀerences in ﬁlm-growth conditions among diﬀerent

groups and the subsequent residual strain states of the ﬁlms, the
“crossover” thickness (G-type to cycloid) diﬀers from report to
report. Most recently, Bertinshaw et al. have showed that they
can grow strain-relaxed BFO ﬁlms down to 100 nm and have
observed cycloids at this thickness.28 As we discuss below, our
ﬁlms used in the present study (80−200 nm thick) exhibit clear
stripe domains, and they thus consist of G-type AFM domains,
which are needed to give rise to the clear exchange bias in the
Co ﬁlm deposited above.
Even though this canted moment geometry is consistent with
the observed exchange bias behavior,23 the details of the
canting has never been experimentally studied. To this end, we
have carried out neutron diﬀraction measurements in the
(HHL) scattering plane in a BFO ﬁlm (200 nm) on the C5

triple axis spectrometer at Chalk River Laboratories in magnetic
ﬁeld at H ≈0 (except for a small guide ﬁeld less than 3 mT).
Figure 3 shows reciprocal space maps of a 200 nm thick BFO
ﬁlm revealed by neutron diﬀraction where only one reﬂection is
present, which indicates that the magnetic structure of BFO
ﬁlm is G-type, rather than cycloids as seen in a previous study.27
In the previous study, the period of the cycloid was found to be
longer. However, with our resolution (indicated in red on the
ﬁgure), we would have still seen the peak splitting. Thus, we are
conﬁdent that these ﬁlms (80−200 nm thick) consist of G-type
domains, rather than magnetic cycloids.
To precisely determine the direction of magnetic moments
of the 200 nm thick BFO ﬁlm, we turned to polarized neutron
diﬀraction measurements in the HHL zone and measured the
(0.5 0.5 0.5) and (−0.5 −0.5 −0.5) magnetic reﬂections.
Several nuclear reﬂections from the substrate were measured to
determine the ﬂipping ratio and the uniformity of the spin
transport, and ﬂipping ratios of ≈15 were achieved. As there is a
3-fold axis about the (111) axis for rhombohedral systems, we
expect magnetic domains to be present. Given equally
populated magnetic domains such as in BFO, we are only
sensitive to the magnitude of the magnetic moment and its
angle with respect to the (111) axis. We are not able to
determine the moment on an absolute scale due to our inability
to measure nuclear reﬂections from the ﬁlm, which will be
shadowed by reﬂections from the substrate. From our ﬁts, we
ﬁnd the angle of the magnetic moment with respect to the
(111) is 83.9(23) degrees (≈84°) which is consistent with the
magnetic easy plane suggested by Ederer et al.26 In the ﬁtting,
we have corrected for nonuniform spin transport and for the
ﬁnite ﬂipping ratio. These results are presented in the
Supporting Information. We note that previous studies have
shown that the magnetic structure of these materials is very
sensitive to strain, growth direction, and synthesis conditions.31
We have investigated the ferroelectric domain structures of
the BFO ﬁlms on STO substrates and their switching modes by
piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The details of the
PFM characterization technique is described elsewhere.13
Brieﬂy, both out-of-plane and in-plane components of the FE
polarization are simultaneously acquired from the PFM images
obtained using two lock-in ampliﬁers. Figure 4a shows the in-
plane PFM images of a 80 nm thick BFO ﬁlm with the PFM
cantilever oriented along the (110) direction in the as grown
state and after 3.5 V poling. Here, the voltage was vertically
applied between two electrodes, i.e., an SRO layer and a Pd
layer (deposited above BFO for this study). To identify the
polarization direction in each ferroelectric domain and their
switching modes, we have taken the in-plane and the out-of-
plane PFM images (not shown here) along two orthogonal
(110) directions of the STO substrate. In the as-grown state,
the stripe domains are clearly observed, and two colors are
seen, which correspond to two possible polarization variants.31
Note that Figure 4a only shows one of the two sets of domains
in the as-grown state. The other set of domains would be
appear orthogonal to the one seen here. Based on both in-plane
and out-of-plane PFM images, we are able to deduce these two
variants to be pointing in (−1−11) and (−111) directions. The
projections of the two variants on the (001) plane marked with
blue arrows in panel a. After the sample is poled at 3.5 V (400
kV/cm), the domains are now split into two sets of stripe
domains orthogonal to each other: the shape/direction of some
of the domains has rotated 90° with respect to the initial shape/
direction. This change is allowed because on BFO ﬁlms grown
on STO the two sets of orthogonal domains are equally likely.

Concomitantly, the domain width has also increased after E-
ﬁeld poling, indicating that some initial domains with diﬀerent
polarization directions have now merged together into a single
polarization direction. Within a ﬁxed PFM region (5 μm × 5
μm), we are able to distinguish the diﬀerent switching modes
(71°, 109°, and 180° switching) after E-ﬁeld poling and to
evaluate the switching mode fractions (Figure 4c). It can be
seen that 54% and 40% of the area have undergone 71° and
109° switching, respectively, and 180° switching has taken place
in less than 10% of the area. These observations are consistent
with the 45° switching mechanism of the magnetic easy axis of
the Co layer deposited on top of the BFO layers as discussed in
the next section.
Figure 4b shows the schematic of two initial polarizations
(−1−11) and (−111) directions (blue arrows). The angle
between the FE polarization and the canted magnetic moment
is 84° is determined by neutron diﬀraction, and it is shown for
one of the FE polarization arrows. As discussed above, it is the
projection of the canted G-type AFM moments on the (001)
plane which generates the exchange bias on adjacent FM layers,
and the projection direction is parallel to the projection of the
polarization on the plane. Figure 4d shows the schematic of the
coupling relationship between the polarization in the BFO layer
and the coupled magnetic moment in the Co layer. Because we
initially have equal populations of (−1−11) and (−111)
domains, the net polarization projection points to the (−100)
direction, as represented by the large solid blue arrow. The
ferroelectric polarization and the canted moments are directly
linked together with 84° via the antiferromagnetic axis L (green
arrows in Figure 4d),1,2,12 and the in-plane projection of the
moment is always parallel to the in-plane projection of the
polarization.2 The end result is that the projection of the canted
AFM moments on the (001) plane initially points to the
(−100) direction as an average over this region. Thus, the Co
layer always has the initial easy axis in this direction (−100)
represented by large solid pink arrow in the Co layer in Figure
4d. We note that we do not apply biasing magnetic ﬁeld during
deposition of the Co-layer on BFO and thus the easy axis
direction is entirely dictated by the distribution of ferroelectric
local domains in BFO. As deduced from PFM images, most of
the domains undergo 71° and 109° switching (Figure 4c), and
the two starting polarizations now point either both in the
(−1−1−1) direction or in the (−1−1−1) and (11−1)
directions after switching. Therefore, the net polarization on
the (001) plane switches 45° or 135° and points to the (−1−
10) (large unﬁlled blue arrow) or the (110) direction. Of the
two, the 135° switching is unlikely because it forms
energetically unfavorable tail-to-tail domain conﬁguration as
discussed in the next section.
Because of the biaxial strain applied to BFO by STO, the
other set of FE domains orthogonal to the region shown in the
initial state of Figure 4a is likely present on other parts of the
same BFO ﬁlm. The polarizations in these FE domains would
naturally switch with the same fractional percentage modes as
the polarizations shown in Figure 4a. The net polarization
directions of a local region before and after E-ﬁeld poling
depend on which set of domains is dominant, which can vary
from sample to sample and the ﬁlm growth conditions,31 and
locally it is always 45° rotated with respect to the net
polarization before poling as described above.
Let us examine the further details of the switching to see how
we end up with a 45° angle but not any other angles. All
possible combinations of the switching of the easy axis of the
Co layer as a result of switching of two initial polarization
directions are shown in Figure 5. The red arrows depict the
average projection of the canted moments of BFO on (001)
plane. Because the moments are tied to the polarizations, the
in-plane directions depicted here simultaneously represent both
the polarization projection and the canted-moment projection,
which determines the local direction of the unidirectional
exchange bias the Co layer experiences. The initial two adjacent
FE polarizations of BFO point to (−1−11) and (−111)
directions (Figure 4b), corresponding to coexisting variants
within one set of domains, and their projections on the (001)
plane of the average polarization is parallel to the net magnetic
moments of the Co layer indicated by the solid pink arrow in
Figure 4d. After poling with a 3.5 V pulse, each polarization can
undergo three possible switching: 71°, 109°, or 180°. Given the
initial projection directions as shown in Figure 4b, then this
results in six possible combinations of relative domain
conﬁgurations for the adjacent domains after switching: namely,
the two switchings are by 71°/71°, 109°/109°, 180°/180°, and
71°/109° (or equivalently 109°/71°), 71°/180° (or equiv-
alently 180°/71°), and 109°/180° (or equivalently 180°/109°)
where the ﬁrst number is the switching angle of the left domain
in Figure 5a−f and the second number after/is the switching
angle of the right domain in Figure 5a−f. It has been reported
that direct 180° switching in strained BFO ﬁlms fabricated on
STO is highly unfavorable energetically and that the two-step
180° switching is likely observed only in small-sized devices
(e.g., 3 μm × 3 μm).32 Thus, for our large devices (100 μm ×
100 μm), we eliminate three of the six conﬁgurations which
involve 180° switching in Figure 5 which are panels c, e, and f.
There are thus three remaining possible switching conﬁg-
urations in Figure 5a, b, and d. Of the three, only the 71°/109°
switching case results in a head-to-tail polarization domain
boundary condition, which is energetically favorable over other
conﬁgurations which result in head-to-head or tail-to-tail
boundary conﬁgurations which are electrostatically unfavorable.
Thus, out of all possible switching conﬁgurations, the 71°/109°
case is the predominant one. This is also consistent with the
fact that we observed more regions with 71° and 109°
switching than ones with 180° switching (Figure 4c). As seen in
Figure 5d, this conﬁguration leads to average direction of the
projected moment at 45° from the (100) direction, resulting in
exchange bias with the easy axis now rotated 45°. It is known
Figure 5. Six possible switching combinations of the canted moments

switching. The inset numbers indicate the switching angles of
polarization, which results in the corresponding moments switching,
and the dashed lines are the FE domain boundary. Note that, in the
cases d and f, the domains would merge to be one.

that the same but reversed path of the polarization rotation is
the favorable one upon application of a reverse ﬁeld.2 This
results in the domains returning to the original domain
conﬁgurations with the second pulse of −3.5 V, thus leading to
the reversible switching of the exchange-biased easy axis of the
Co-layer between (100) and (110) directions as observed here.
In considering diﬀerent exchange coupling mechanisms
involving perovskite oxide layers, superexchange observed in
heteroepiaxial superlattice structures comes to mind.33,34 In
such structures, the interfacial superexchange coupling through
an epitaxial interface arises from the ferromagnetic moments of
the magnetic layer and the induced surface moments in the
nonmagnetic layer [e.g., PrBa2Cu3O7 (ref 33), LaFeO3 (ref 34)
layer)] due to the charge transfer and/or electronic orbital
reconstruction at the interface. The superexchange coupling
takes place only between ions (e.g., Fe3+, Mn3+, Mn4+, Cu2+,
etc.) at the interface through O2−ions.
In our Co/BFO structures, we rule out the occurrence of
such a superexchange mechanism. As we shown in the
Supporting Information, the Co layer is not epitaxially grown
on BFO layer, and we do not expect the Co layer to be oxidized
since it was deposited at room temperature. Therefore, Co2+ or
Co3+ cations were not provided from Co layer side for the
superexchange coupling. Meanwhile, our BFO ﬁlms display
stripe domains, and their exchange coupling behaviors are very
similar to ﬁlms by Martin et al.;14 namely, we see coercivity
enhancement, but there is no exchange bias shift. We therefore
believe our Co/BFO coupling is similar to the exchange
coupling in the CoFe/BFO interface described in Martin et al.
and that the BFO moments are compensated in our samples.14
In this case, the exchange coupling in our system arises from
the surface magnetic heterogeneities, such as the nanoscale
domain walls.14
The diﬀerence between the deterministic 180° magnetization
switching of a CoFe layer in CoFe/BFO/SRO/DSO structures
previously reported by Heron et al.1,2 and the 45° switching in
our structures on STO is attributed to two facts. First, the
diﬀerent substrates give rise to diﬀerent strain states imposed
on BFO ﬁlms, and thus there are diﬀerent FE domain
structures in BFO. Speciﬁcally on DSO substrates, only one
set of stripe domains are observed in epitaxial BFO,1,2,35 as
opposed to the two sets observed in BFO on STO. DSO has an
orthorhombic structure with the lattice constant a = 5.54 Å, b =
5.71 Å, and c = 7.89 Å (pseudocubic lattice constant 3.944 Å),
whereas the lattice constant of STO is a = b = c = 3.91 Å. The
diﬀerence in the lattice mismatch between the substrates and
BFO (a = b = 3.96 Å, c = 4.02 Å) is such that the symmetry in
relative populations of diﬀerent polarization domains of
strained (001) BFO ﬁlms grown epitaxially on DSO is broken,
leading to only one set of domains in BFO on DSO.35−37 On
STO, on the other hand, BFO experiences biaxial strain,
resulting in roughly equal proportion of diﬀerent polarization
domains, giving rise to the observed PFM images with two sets
of stripe domains.32,35
Second, it is known that the diﬀerent device sizes and varying
FE domain sizes can lead to diﬀerent switching behaviors
because the stability of 71°switching is associated with the
domain size.32 As reported in refs 1 and 32, the deterministic
180° switching in the 3 μm × 3 μm sized device is a two-step
switching process consisting of a 71° switching and a 109°
switching, where the initial 71° switched state relaxes via a
subsequent 109° switching. The relaxation rate of the
“intermediated” 71° switched state depends on the local FE
domain volume and is inversely proportional to the E-ﬁeld
poled area due to the depolarization from the unswitched
area.1,32 In our 45° switching case, the area size of the Co pad
(E-ﬁeld poled area, see the cartoon in Figure 1) is 100 × 100 or
(200 × 200) μm2 which is much larger than the E-ﬁeld poled
area in the device areas reported by Heron et al. and by Baek et
al., where the 180° switching was observed.1,32
Thus, the relaxation rate from 71° switching to 180°
switching in the present devices is expected to be much longer,
or the relaxation rate is so long that the subsequent switching
does not take place. In other words, the 71° switching is stable,
and the 180° switching (71° followed by 109°) does not take
place in our relatively large devices. Therefore, 45° switching of
magnetization in the exchange-coupled adjacent FM layer is
dominant if the BFO ﬁlm is grown with biaxial strained (on
STO) which results in two sets of FE domains and if the E-ﬁeld
is applied to a large area (≈100 μm2 region) in BFO ﬁlm,
whereas two-step 180° switching of magnetization is dominant
in a smaller E-ﬁeld poling area (e.g., 500 nm2 region) in BFO
ﬁlms grown on anisotropic structural substrates such as DSO.
The minimum size of the present devices (≈100 μm2) was
limited to the size large enough for us to obtain LMOKE
signals. We also note that, because of this relatively large pad
size, it is possible to have both sets of domains present within a
pad each exhibiting its own reversible 45° rotation locally. In
such a case, depending on the relative direction of the initial
polarization directions within each set of domains, the pad as a
whole then might not exhibit a clear single 45 switching of the
easy axis. Even in this complex scenario, we would still expect
some reversible switching of the overall magnetic state to take
place resulting in reversible change of the coercive ﬁeld of the
Co layer in some ﬁxed directions.
To further demonstrate the reversible control of the
magnetic state of the adjacent Co-layer by E-ﬁeld, we have
investigated how magnetic HC changes with the applied E-ﬁeld
in Co/BFO (200 nm) ﬁlm heterostructure devices (100 μm ×
100 μm). Figure 6a shows three representative LMOKE M(H)
loops with a magnetic ﬁeld applied along the (110) direction of
STO substrate in the as-grown state and after applying
subsequent ±10 V pulses. Clearly, the HC changes with
diﬀerent E-ﬁeld pulses applied to the BFO layer. The HC is 4.8
mT in the as-grown state; it increases to 11 mT after a +10 V
pulse poling, and then it decreases to 6.8 mT after applying the
second −10 V pulse. Based on a set of M(H) loops obtained
after applying diﬀerent voltage pulses, we have plotted the HC
of the Co layer for the initial easy axis direction as a function of
the applied E-ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 6b. The black curve is
the HC versus E-ﬁeld in the ﬁrst poling cycle where the device
was poled with changing amplitude of the voltage pulses from
the initial state to +15 V, then to −15 V, and ﬁnally back to 0 V
where each voltage pulse was applied for 10 s. In the ascending
branch, the HC increases slightly from the initial value of 4.8
mT after poling with pulses of +2 V and +5 V but rapidly jumps
up to 11.0 mT at +7.5 V. The HC value then remains at 11.0
mT, while the amplitude of the voltage pulse further increases
to as high as +15 V. In the descending branch, the HC slightly
decreases from 11.0 mT at the saturation state and then jumps
down to 6.8 mT after a −5 V voltage was applied. The HC value
then remains a constant for subsequently applied pulses with
increasing negative voltage amplitude. We then preformed the
same measurements on the same Co pad after the ﬁrst poling
cycle and measured the HC as a function of E-ﬁeld for the
second poling cycle in Figure 6b, denoted by the red curve. The

second poling process shows two similar reversible HC states
with the ﬁrst poling process: the E-ﬁeld dependent HC shows a
hysteresis behavior with clear two reversible HC states (high HC
and low HC).
To conﬁrm that the observed reversible HC states are directly
correlated with ferroelectric states, we measured the polar-
ization−electric ﬁeld (P−E) loop of BFO ﬁlm. As shown in
Figure 6c, the P−E loop of 200 nm thick BFO ﬁlm shows a
saturation polarization of about 70 μC/cm2 and the ferro-
electric coercivity (EC) is +7.5 V and −5 V in the ascending
branch and descending branch, respectively. The switching of
the HC states is coincident with FE polarization switching
taking place at EC, indicating that the observed two reversible
HC states are directly associated with the switching of the FE
polarization of BFO.
In the present work, the mechanism of the HC-state
switching is due to the reversible switching of the FE
polarization in the BFO layer and the easy axis direction in
the adjacent Co layer. Because the HC states are tied to the
reversible modulation of the magnetic anisotropy, the eﬀect is
expected to be robust and scalable. It provides an alternative
pathway of reversible magnetic state modulation compared to
the 180° switching of magnetization. We have veriﬁed the
reversibility of the switching in some devices with over 500
alternating voltage pulses to date. Further reversible switching
cycle test is currently ongoing and will be reported in the
future.
In summary, we have demonstrated reversible control of the
magnetic state of a ferromagnetic Co layer by an E-ﬁeld in Co/
BFO ﬁlm heterostructure devices fabricated on STO substrates.
The LMOKE studies on the bilayer heterostructure suggest that
the easy axis of Co is reversibly switched by 45° back and forth
under the voltage pulses applied on the BFO. A new switching
mechanism of the net vector of the exchange coupled Co-layer
coupled to the canted moment of the AFM in multidomain
BFO is proposed to explain the 45° switching. These results
demonstrate that the BFO devices fabricated on common STO
substrates have the potential to serve as the basis for reversible
E-ﬁeld switchable spin valves with low energy consumption.
The switching mechanism is a generic one since it arises
naturally from the multidomain state of BFO, and reversible
modulation of magnetic anisotropy provides a possible path
toward device scaling. Because epitaxial STO can be prepared
on Si substrates,18−20 this opens the door for fabrication of
reversible multiferroic spin valves on Si.
Method. Epitaxial BFO thin ﬁlms used in this study were
grown under 25 mTorr oxygen environment and at 590 °C
using pulsed laser deposition on (001) oriented STO substrates
with a predeposited 50 nm SrRuO3 (SRO) layer, which serves
as the bottom electrode. A 5 nm thick Co layer is deposited
above the BFO layer by e-beam deposition which is patterned
into arrays of square pads of diﬀerent sizes using a lift-oﬀ
process. A 5 nm Pd cap layer was deposited on the top of the
Co layer to prevent its oxidization. The root-mean-square
(RMS) surface roughness of our 100 nm thick BFO ﬁlms is
typically 2 nm measured over 5 μm × 5 μm area.
