We have investigated the magnetic ground state of CuFeAs and CuFeSb by means of 57Fe-M¨ossbauer
spectroscopy, muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR), neutron diffraction, and electronic structure calculations. Both
materials share the 111-LiFeAs crystal structure and are closely related to the class of iron-based superconductors.
In both materials there is a considerable occupancy of the Cu site by Fe, which leads to ferromagnetic moments,
which are magnetically strongly coupled to the regular Fe site magnetism. Our study shows that CuFeAs is close
to an antiferromagnetic instability, whereas a ferromagnetic ground state is observed in CuFeSb, supporting
theoretical models of anion height driven magnetism.

I. INTRODUCTION
The so-called “111” class of iron pnictides contains
compounds which are isostructural to LiFeAs [1]. LiFeAs was
the ﬁrst discovered stoichiometric iron-based superconductor
after LaFePO [2]. Interestingly, other parent compounds like
NaFeAs [3] and LiFeP [4] are also superconducting, even
though every single compound seems special. While LiFeP
belongs [5] to the nodal class of iron-based phosphide super-
conductors [6], NaFeAs shows only a small superconducting
volume fraction (but that rapidly increases upon electron
doping [7,8]), along with the usual stripe antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order and a nematic state in an exceptionally broad
temperature range. In LiFeAs the details of the supercon-
ducting states are still under debate [9,10]. It features weak
Fermi surface nesting conditions [11] and a moderate degree
of electron correlation [12,13] and was initially considered

close to the stripe AFM ground state [14,15], but with a small
interlayer spin coupling that prevents magnetic order [16].
LiFeAs is called a “paradigmatic testbed for theoretical models
on multiband superconductors” [9].
Moon et al. predicted larger magnetic moments and
stronger Hund’s rule coupling in case of (As,Sb) substitution
in the 111 class, stabilizing a magnetic phase [17]. According
to their later work [18] the increased anion height hanion
through larger ionic radius of Sb compared to As or P plays
an important role, because an increasing anion height can
render a magnetic system from the typically observed stripe
over to double stripe AFM order (observed in FeTe [19]), to
ﬁnally a ferromagnetic (FM) order for hanion > 1.9 ˚A. This
idea was further pursued by Yin, Lee, and Ku [20] to generate
a uniﬁed picture of hanion driven magnetism in iron-based
arsenides and chalcogenides in general. An increase in hanion
corresponds to a decreased hopping of itinerant dxz or dyz
electrons, consequently the increase in local moment.
The anion heights of LiFeP, NaFeAs, and LiFeAs increase
from 1.32 ˚A to 1.44 ˚A and 1.51 ˚A [1,3,4], respectively,
and thus still range around the optimal anion height for
superconductivity [21]. FeTe still exhibits the largest hanion =
1.74 ˚A [22], showing bicolinear order. So far, ferromagnetism
of the transition metal ions was only observed in Co based

materials LaOCoP and LaOCoAs [23] until 2012, when
CuFeSb was synthesized by Qian et al. [24]. CuFeSb is a soft
ferromagnet, which shows a high spin polarization and a large
anion height of hanion = 1.84–1.89 ˚A [24,25], vindicating the
theories. Aside from the unique itinerant ferromagnetism of an
iron pnictide in general, it is remarkable that a transition metal
like Cu occupies the alkali ion position, opening an alternative
route for the search of novel materials in the framework of iron-
based superconductivity. This new route was consequently
used for the synthesis of CuFeAs, where the substitution
of Sb by As should naturally decrease hanion. However, the
reported anion heights of 1.74 AA [26] to 1.8 ˚A [27] are still
large and justify a ground state with dominant ferromagnetic
interactions and large magnetic moments. This was explicitly
shown in electronic structure calculations applied to CuFeAs
and CuFeSb [28]. Experimentally, these expectations are not
reﬂected in CuFeAs. Instead, an AFM ground state with
<0.2 μB/Fe below 9 K by Thakur et al. [26] and a weak
FM ground state with 0.4 μB/Fe by Qian et al. [27] for Cu
deﬁcient specimens are observed.
The discrepancy of experimental observations and theo-
retical modeling challenges the intrinsic properties, structural
parameters, and/or stoichiometry which have been reported so
far. Both the investigations of Thakur [26] and Qian [27] give
room for further interpretation because important statements
are based on macroscopic susceptibility data, which show
neither typical AFM nor typical FM behavior. The focus of our
investigation is to examine both systems from a microscopic
point of view by means of 57Fe M¨ossbauer spectroscopy
and muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR). Moreover, neutron
diffraction was performed to determine the real crystallo-
graphic structure and search for and identify the CuFeAs long
range order. Finally, DFT calculations quantify the effect of
Cu deﬁciency on the stabilization of a magnetic ground state
and anion height.
Our experiments on CuFeSb reproduce the soft FM order
and evidence a strong coupling of the magnetic order param-
eters at the regular Fe site and secondary Fe site at the Cu
position. One major result of this paper is that this Fe-Cu
mixing not only takes place in CuFeSb, but in CuFeAs as
well. An FM behavior of CuFeAs thus can be attributed to the
secondary Fe moments with a magnetic moment of ≈1 μB at
the Cu site. The regular iron site on the other hand is close to
a magnetic instability with saturated moments of ≈0.4 μB. In
our sample this magnetic ground state is only partially realized
due to Cu deﬁciency or the doping effect of secondary iron.
Because of the strong coupling of magnetic order parameters at
both sites, there is a common ordering temperature of ≈11 K.
II. METHODS
Polycrystalline specimens of CuFeAs and CuFeSb were
prepared as described elsewhere [25,26]. For μSR we used the
same samples as previously described by Thakur et al. [26],
whereas for neutron diffraction a new sample was synthesized.
The samples are then accordingly designated as “μSR” and
“neutron.” Withtheexceptionof anincreasedhomogeneityand
slightly reduced amount of excess iron in the neutron sample,
both samples are comparable with respect to M¨ossbauer and
WDX analysis.
M¨ossbauer spectroscopy was performed in a standard
transmission geometry employing a 57Co source with initial
activity of 2 GBq and a source linewidth of 0.105 mm/s. A thin
powder ﬁlm was dried from an ethanol slurry and stabilized
with dried sugar on top. The drive was run in sinusoidal mode
minimizing the velocity error. The measurements were carried
out in an Oxford continuous ﬂow cryostat in under-pressure
mode enabling temperatures from 2 K to 315 K. The applied
magnetic ﬁeld has a homogeneity of 0.6% over the sample.
M¨ossbauer spectra were analyzed with Moessﬁt [29] using
transmission integral simulation, with the exception of those
treated with maximum entropy method (MEM). Isomer shifts
δ are given relatively to room temperature α iron.
μSR measurements using a pressed pellet were carried out
in the GPS instrument at the πM3.2 beamline of the Paul
Scherrer Institute in Switzerland between 1.6 K and 290 K at
zero and 5 mT transverse ﬁeld. The muon spin was rotated by
≈50◦with respect to the beam direction.
High intensity/coarse resolution neutron measurements at
the NCNR were carried out on the BT-7 spectrometer using
collimations of 80’ full-width-at-half-maximum before and
after the pyrolytic graphite (PG) monochromator and 80’
radial collimator after the sample, with the 1-d position
sensitive detector [30]. An incident monochromatic beam of
λ = 2.4436 ˚A was employed with a PG ﬁlter to suppress
higher-order wavelengths. A closed cycle helium refrigerator
was employed to take data at 2.5 K and 20 K to search for
evidence of magnetic long range order. High resolution powder
neutron diffraction data were collected on the BT-1 high-
resolution neutron powder diffractometer, using monochro-
matic neutrons of wavelength λ = 1.5403 ˚A produced by a
Cu(311) monochromator. S¨oller collimations before and after
the monochromator and after the sample were 15’, 20’, and
7’ full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), respectively. Data
were collected in the 2θ range of 3◦to 168◦with a step size
of 0.05 θ at 20 K, and structural reﬁnements were performed
using the FullProf program [31].
The homogeneity of the samples has been examined
by wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDX) on an
electron microprobe Cameca SX100. The coarse powder of
CuFeAs was mounted in a conductive epoxy resin with
silver ﬁller (EpoTek H20E), which allows us to prepare
metallographic microstructures suitable for microprobe anal-
yses. The local chemical composition of several particles
was analyzed by using an electron beam of 20 kV and
20 nA. The mass concentration of the elements was calculated
from the intensities ratio of the K(alpha) lines measured
on the CuFeAs phase and on the references As, Cu, and
FeSi. The PAP model [32] was used to take matrix ef-
fects into account. Topographic effects do not inﬂuence
the analytical results due to the planarity of the sample
surface.
The electronic structure calculations for CuFeAs are per-
formed using the full-potential local-orbital code (FPLO),
version 9.07 [33,34]. The local (spin) density approximation
[L(S)DA] with the Perdew and Wang ﬂavor [35] of the
exchange and correlation potential was selected. For the re-
laxation of the internal positions, also the generalized gradient
approximation [36] was applied, yielding basically identical
parameters. As lattice parameters we applied the neutron

III. RESULTS
A. Structural analysis using neutron diffraction on CuFeAs
A preliminary structural reﬁnement of the BT-7 data
indicated that both the Cu and Fe sites are fully occupied for
the neutron sample. Subsequently high resolution data were
collected at 20 K with a vanadium sample holder. Figure 1
shows the neutron powder diffraction pattern and Rietveld
reﬁnement ﬁt results for CuFeAs. The colored vertical lines
show the Bragg positions of CuFeAs, of 18% Cu3As (PDF#74-
1068), and of 8% Fe3O4 [39]. The Rietveld reﬁnement results
for CuFeAs are listed in Table I. The results demonstrate that
all sites are fully occupied consistent with previously reported
x-ray results [26]. Presence of FeAs impurity can be excluded.

FIG. 2. Results of M¨ossbauer spectroscopy on the CuFeAs μSR
sample. The left inset shows the two component model at 2 K
with CuFeAs (solid) and ferrocene (dashed, providing experimental
linewidth). The increase of magnetic ﬁeld Btot below 11 K is
accompanied by a drop of spectral area (right inset), indicating that
≈10% of the Fe nuclei sense much higher ﬁelds than quantiﬁed
by Btot. The transition temperature shifts upon the application of a
0.5 T longitudinal ﬁeld (LF) revealing the ferromagnetic character
of the magnetic order. Only at the lowest temperatures does a static
superposition of zero ﬁeld (ZF) Bhyp and applied ﬁeld Bex as described
by Btot,theo [Eq. (1)] apply. In that case dominant AFM order is present.
B. Zero ﬁeld (ZF) M¨ossbauer spectroscopy of CuFeAs
The CuFeAs M¨ossbauer spectrum mainly consists of a
quadrupole doublet (Fig. 2 inset, Fig. 3) with a quadrupole
splitting (Table II) typical for 122 compounds [40]. Below 11 K
it broadens by ≈0.1 mm/s. The right side appears broader,
which could be associated with a FeAs doublet. However,
the absence of this phase in XRD and neutron diffraction
and the remaining asymmetry for 15 K < T < 60 K, i.e.,
at temperatures where magnetic splitting of the FeAs was
expected, suggest a different origin.
The main doublet was modeled in terms of the fully static
Hamiltonian assuming an axially symmetric electric ﬁeld gra-
dient (EFG). Already at room temperature the experimentally
observed linewidth ωsmp (Table II) considerably exceeds the
usual spectrometer limit of 0.07 mm/s, indicating strong
distortions of the electronic iron environment especially for
the μSR sample. This broadening was modeled by a Gaussian

of a Lorentzian line broadening. The standard deviations

2 and 4 V/ ˚A
2 for the μSR and neutron sample,
respectively, were determined from a global ﬁt of spectra with
T > 50 K and kept constant for the main ﬁt.
The observed magnetic broadening below 11 K strongly
interferes with the experimental variation of the resonance
linewidth. The experimental linewidth depends sensitively
on the current needle valve passage and evaporation rates
of liquid nitrogen and helium. Therefore we attached an
additional 12 mg ferrocene absorber to the CuFeAs sample
to provide a standard linewidth (see spectrum in Fig. 2). Any
additional broadening on top of the standard linewidth and Vzz
distribution is modeled by Bhyp > 0 T. Using the ferrocene
absorber signiﬁcantly reduces the scattering of the determined
total ﬁeld Btot (Fig. 2).
For both samples the broadening starts at ≈11 K and
almost linearly increases down to 5 K, below which the curve
slightly ﬂattens. The broadening corresponds to a hyperﬁne
ﬁeldBhyp ≈1T. Assuminganironpnictidespeciﬁcconversion
ratio of 6.7 T/μB [40], this corresponds to a magnetic
moment of 0.15 μB. This value is somewhat lower than the
saturation moment between 0.2 and 0.3 μB/Fe, which the
magnetization measurements suggest [26,27]. In the same
temperature interval the total modeled absorption, measured
by the effective thickness ta (Fig. 2, inset), decreases by
≈10%, indicating that parts of the previous doublet now sense
hyperﬁne ﬁelds much stronger than 1 T, so that they are not
captured by the single site model anymore.
We applied a 0.5 T ﬁeld parallel to the gamma beam to study
the response of the measured magnetic ﬁeld at the nucleus
site. With respect to such a small external ﬁeld a typical AFM
ground state in iron pnictides is expected to be rigid [41], so
that a simple superposition of intrinsic Bhyp and applied ﬁeld
Bex should be observed. This leads to the following expression
if powder averaging is applied:

For the analysis we applied the same model as for the
ZF data except that we took 0.5 T magnetic splitting of the
ferrocene doublet into account. In Fig. 2 the result of this
longitudinal ﬁeld (LF) investigation is shown. The onset of
broadening shifts to ≈25 K and the curve is not reproduced
by Eq. (1) even though for the lowest temperatures the
experimental data and theoretical superposition approach each
other. In the same way the absorption loss measured by means
of ta is shifted to higher temperatures and does not reach the
zero ﬁeld values even above 25 K. This strongly suggests a
ﬁeld induced ferromagnetism and a dominant ferromagnetic
character of the observed magnetic order.
We took high statistics spectra (Fig. 3) to both clarify
the absorption loss in the magnetic phase and quantify the
secondary doublet causing the asymmetry of the main doublet.
A 10% Fe3O4 fraction fFe3O4 was modeled according to the
data of D´ezsi et al. [42], consistent with neutron diffraction.
In addition to the main doublet with larger linewidth at
low temperatures, two further subspectra were introduced:
a doublet “2nd trans” responsible for the main doublet’s
asymmetry at high temperatures and a sextet (“2nd ferro”)
modeling the additional magnetic component underneath the
main signal. For the “2nd trans” component we chose an angle
of 90◦between the EFG-z axis and the small transferred
magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld at 2 K to achieve a reasonable
temperature dependence of the center shift. The corresponding
ﬁt are presented in Fig. 3 and in Table III. The data support
the picture of spectral weight being transferred from the
paramagnetic main doublet to a broad magnetic component
underneath. The hyperﬁne parameters of the secondary phases
deserve special attention: The Vzz,para and Bhyp,ferro values
are comparable to hyperﬁne parameters of the second Fe
site in Fe2As [43,44], which corresponds to the Cu site
in CuFeAs. The sum of fractions f2nd trans + f2ndferro = 0.09
seems temperature independent. Considering Fe2As was used
as a precursor in the synthesis it seems possible that there is a
ﬁnite occupancy of the Cu site in CuFeAs by Fe. In that case
locally a Fe2As structure appears.

MAGNETISM AND SITE EXCHANGE IN CuFeAs AND . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 95, 094415 (2017)
C. Transverse ﬁeld (TF) M¨ossbauer spectroscopy of CuFeAs
We applied an external ﬁeld Bex ⩽6.3 T to study locally
the susceptibility of the magnetic moments to the ﬁeld at
2 K. The ﬁeld was applied transverse to the gamma beam
to allow the M¨ossbauer source to reside in an almost ﬁeld
free position close to the sample. The 57Fe probe measures
the vector sum of the internal Bhyp and the applied ﬁeld Bex.
When the moments get aligned to the external ﬁeld the applied
ﬁeld will be reduced by the internal ﬁeld due to the negative
sign of the Fermi contact interaction. On the other hand
moments will align antiferromagnetically to each other due
to the exchange ﬁeld BJ and will be pinned to an anisotropy
axis described by anisotropy ﬁeld BA. Large BJ and/or BA
prohibit a polarization, leading to a line broadening as a result
of the random superposition of Bhyp and Bex. We applied the
uniaxial antiferromagnetic Hamiltonian. Its solution describes
the energy dependence of the polar angles θi of the two
moments and ξ of the anisotropy axis with respect to the
external ﬁeld.

The bipod of EFG z axis and BA is randomly distributed
with respect to the ﬁxed laboratory frame, i.e., to the gamma
ray and Bex, which are perpendicular to each other. We chose
35 equally distributed orientations of the anisotropy ﬁeld
BA, each allowing for ﬁve orientations of the EFG-z axis
perpendicular to BA consistent with ordinary stripe AFM order.
Although the total number of 175 subspectra seems rather low
to simulate the AFM powder in a transverse ﬁeld, we found
no signiﬁcant changes in a simulation with a higher number of
sampling orientations.
The neutron sample was measured in Bex = 6.3 T at
2 K (Fig. 4). Three fractions are necessary to reproduce
the data: 41(4)% paramagnetic, 44(5)% antiferromagnetic
[BA = 1.5 T, BJ = 28(10) T,Bhyp = 2.2(2) T], and 15(1)%

and 20(1)%, but the corresponding ﬁelds can not be determined
independently.
These ferromagnetic contributions in this experiment can
be identiﬁed with the secondary iron in ZF. Due to the large
applied ﬁeld the fraction of these iron atoms with a large on-site
magnetic moment appears increased as a result of induced
ferromagnetism. The regular iron site, which showed a net
magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld of ≈1 T in ZF, obviously required
a more differentiated description in TF. It seems that half of
the iron sites behave paramagnetically, whereas the other half
exhibits ≈0.3 μB on-site magnetic moment. We note that this
picture presents the easiest model consistent with our data.
Eventually the necessity of two components for the regular
iron site indicates a magnetic disorder in the main Fe layer.
D. μSR on CuFeAs
The μSR investigations focus on temperatures T ⩽32 K.
The zero ﬁeld (ZF) muon spin polarization is exponentially
damped at 32 K (Fig. 5), which is probably caused by
diluted magnetic impurities. However, at lower temperatures
the polarization approaches zero evidencing an additional
dynamic relaxation. Below 15 K an increasing fraction of the
muons relax very fast (>5 μs−1), indicating static magnetic
order.
A two component model is sufﬁcient to describe the data:
A(t)
A0j
= fmag cos ϕj(2/3 · e−λT t + 1/3 · e−(λenvt)β)
+ (1 −fmag) cos ϕjGLKT (t,λ0)e−(λenvt)β.
(3)
The index j indicates the detector pair, either up-down (ud)
or forward-backward (fb). ϕj quantiﬁes the initial rotation
of the muon and couples the data of both detector pairs
by ϕf b −ϕud = 90◦due to the experimental arrangement of
the detectors. The model consists of a magnetically ordered
volume fraction fmag and a paramagnetic fraction (1 −fmag).
The latter is described by the Lorentz-Kubo-Toyabe function
GLKT . The static damping rate λ0 = 0.17(1) at 32 K due to
magnetic impurities was ﬁxed for all temperatures.

FIG. 6. Relaxation rates of the muon spin polarization functions.
In typical magnetically ordered powder samples 1/3 of
the muon spin polarization (called the “tail”) is sustained or
relaxes with the rate λenv. Due to experimental reasons the
tail fraction is slightly decreased in the fb and increased in
the ud direction. We assume that the muon thermalizes to
an elevated position between four iron moments, similar to
other iron arsenides [45–47]. In NaFeAs the absolute value
of the largest precession frequency is consistent with such a
muon position and a moment of ≈0.3 μB, which is observed
experimentally [48,49], so there is good reason to assume the
usual muon position in the 111 compounds albeit theoretical
calculations are missing so far.
The stretching exponent β turns out to be 1 for T > 12 K
and ⟨β⟩= 0.79 for T < 10 K. The peak of the dynamic
relaxation rate λenv below 10 K (Fig. 6) monitors the slowing
down of electronic spin ﬂuctuations close to the magnetic
phase transition. This shows that the relaxation is dominated
by the iron magnetism at low temperatures. The theory for
magnetically disordered crystals predicts β = 0.5 in the fast
ﬂuctuation limit [50]. It can be concluded that the iron
magnetic order has either diluted defects or consists of large
diluted moments, or both. On the other hand at higher
temperatures the ﬂuctuation rates of iron moments are too
fast for the time window of μSR. In that case relaxation
is mainly due to more homogeneously disordered nuclear
magnetic moments justifying β = 1.
The magnetic volume fraction fmag continuously increases
below 20 K. A small fraction 10(1)% remains “nonmagnetic”
corresponding to diamagnetic Cu3As. A constant 6% mag-
netically ordered fraction may be attributed to regions with
substantial Fe occupancy of the Cu sites, called Fe2As-like in
Fig. 7. A ﬁt of the temperature dependence of the remaining
fmag with Gaussian error function yields Tc = 11.2(5) K taking
a 50% criterion as a basis. All these results are in accordance
with XRD and susceptibility measurements [26].
The transverse ﬁeld measurements were carried out to
verify the volume fractions extracted from ZF. The 1.6 K
TF spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The data were ﬁt using the

FIG. 7. Magnetic volume fraction in CuFeAs derived from ZF
and TF μSR experiments. The solid line is a phenomenological
ﬁt using two error functions (erf ) quantifying the magnetic in-
homogeneity. The discrepancy between ZF and TF data probably
shows that for T < 10 K internal ﬁelds are partly smaller than 5
mT. On the other hand the applied ﬁeld induces ferromagnetism
at ≈20 K.
Inherently, the TF data give a lower limit for the magnetic
volume fraction and partly fall 10% below the ZF data.
This may be caused by the fraction of small ﬁelds B ⩽Bex,
which contribute to the ZF magnetic fraction but will cause
a coherent precession in a small ﬁeld and thus contribute
to the paramagnetic fraction in TF [51]. Since the model
only contains a single nonmagnetic signal fraction describing
both paramagnetic CuFeAs and diamagnetic [52] Cu3As the
muon spin precession frequency ω = γ BWT F depends on the
contributing volume fractions. A nonrelaxing tail in the TF
measurements at the lowest temperatures is evident in Fig. 8.
Its temperature dependence, shown in the inset, indicates
a continuous reduction with increasing temperature due to
decreasing magnetic order parameter, i.e., the intrinsic local
ﬁeld at some muon sights becomes as small as the applied
ﬁeld [51]. The presence of the tail unambiguously proves the
static character of the magnetic order, however the small ftail

indicates that these static magnetic ﬁelds differ strongly in
magnitude.
E. Search for magnetic order using neutron
diffraction on CuFeAs
High intensity diffraction data were measured at 2.5 K and
20 K to search for magnetic Bragg peaks indicative of long
range magnetic order [Fig. 9(a)]. By subtracting the 20 K
data from the data at lower temperature (2.5 K), the nuclear
Bragg peaks are eliminated (assuming there is no substantial
magnetic coupling to the lattice), leaving only the magnetic
diffraction pattern [Fig. 9(b)]. No magnetic peaks were found
in the subtraction, and hence no long range magnetic order
was found. If we assume a propagation wave vector K =
(0,0,0), the irreducible representations for the Fe site can be
written as mag = 13 + 16 + 29 + 210, where 13, 29 are
ferromagnetic and 16, 210 are antiferromagnetic. In addition,
13 only allows the spins to point along the c axis and 29 only
allows the spins to lie in the a-b plane. The difference data
can be used to estimate limits for the Fe ions ordered magnetic
moment as mc < 0.1 μB along the c axis and m < 0.05 μB
in the a-b plane. If we consider antiferromagnetic structures
where the magnetic peaks are separated from the structural
peaks, the statistical limit on a moment is m ⩽0.04 μB.
These limits apply to long range ordered (resolution-limited)
magnetic Bragg peaks. The M¨ossbauer and muon data, on the
other hand, suggest that the order is short range in nature.
This would broaden any magnetic peaks, making detection of
a magnetic signal more difﬁcult and consequently the limit to
any possible ordered moment larger.

neutron samples, probed by WDX. It suggests that the Cu sites have
some limited occupation by Fe.
F. Local elemental constitution of CuFeAs probed by WDX
With the ﬁndings of secondary Fe sites and the dis-
crepancy of Cu-z positions between XRD [26] and neutron
diffraction, which can interfere with the site occupancy, we
reinvestigated both samples by means of wavelength dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy (WDX). The averaged composition is
Cu0.91(2)Fe1.13(2)As for the μSR sample and Cu0.91(3)Fe1.10(2)As
for the neutron sample. Because both XRD and neutron
diffraction state a full occupancy of the crystallographic site we
act on the assumption of a considerable occupancy of the Cu
site by iron. The anticorrelation of Cu and Fe site occupancy
takes place not only in average, but on every single data point
of both samples. In Fig. 10 we show the data of the individual
data points. The solid lines correspond to a linear ﬁt with ﬁxed
slope −1, obviously describing the data. The large standard
variations for both element Fe and Cu compared to the As
value reﬂect the signiﬁcant variability of the composition of the
phase for Fe and Cu. The increased excess iron content of the
μSR sample is responsible for the shift of the corresponding
data in Fig. 10. The increased structural disorder may be
responsible for the increased paramagnetic linewidth of the
μSR sample in M¨ossbauer spectroscopy.
G. Theoretical investigation
For different samples, various Cu content and atomic
positions have been reported [26,27]. However, FeAs-based
compounds are well known for their strong sensitivity of the
magnetism to the internal coordinates, in particular to the As
position zAs [37,53]. We focus our theoretical investigation to
construct a relevant model, which describes the inﬂuence of
(i) the Cu content and (ii) the As position zAs on the electronic
and magnetic properties.
To gain deeper insight into the electronic structure and
the orbital occupations of CuFeAs we calculate the density
of states (DOS). Figure 11 shows the nonmagnetic total and
site-resolved calculated DOS for the fully occupied copper
site. In accordance with similar FeAs-based compounds, Fe-3d

FIG. 11. Calculated nonmagnetic total and site-resolved density
of states for stoichiometric CuFeAs. The states close to the Fermi
energy (EF) consist mainly of Fe-3d contributions. The Cu-3d states

to the Fermi surface is very small.
states dominate clearly in the vicinity of the Fermi level, in
contrast the Cu-3d bands lie in a region of deeper energy
centered at about −3 eV and exhibit certain analogy to metallic
Cu (not shown here). The Cu contribution at the Fermi level is
rather small, comparable with the contribution of As.
Regarding the low lying, essentially fully ﬁlled Cu-3d
states, we assume that each Cu transfers one valence electron
(4s) to the valence band. Thus, one electron was chosen for the
VCA treatment. For the largest Cu deﬁciency, a Cu occupancy
of 0.789 was noted by Qian et al. [27]. Thus, we simulated a
Cu content in a range of 0.8–1.2 within the VCA.
VCA was demonstrated to describe successfully electronic
and magnetic properties in good approximation in Fe pnictides
on different sites upon doping [37,54,55]. Due to the layered
nature of the systems, it works particularly well for the anion
site: If the hybridization of a speciﬁc site with the relevant
magnetic states is small (as in our case), VCA will reﬂect
the changes with respect to band ﬁlling and the change in
the averaged crystal potential rather well. In the case of
CuyFeAs, y < 1 describes Cu vacancies (hole doping) in the
Cu layer, whereas y > 1 describes the situation of electron
doping. The VCA calculations are expected to model the
respective changes of the magnetism for the Fe site of the
Fe-As layers; the behavior of Fe at the Cu site is not covered
by this VCA approach.
Figure 12 visualizes the results of these calculations: For the
experimental structure data we ﬁnd magnetic order for full Cu
occupation (stoichiometric compound). The relaxation of Cu
with respect to the total energy has almost no inﬂuence on the
structure and only a small inﬂuence on the magnetic moment.
As known from previous studies of Fe-pnictide compounds,
the calculated relaxed As position zAs = 0.2490 yields short
Fe-As bonds and a too small hanion = 1.455 ˚A compared to
experimental data. However, an underestimate of less than
0.1 ˚A compared with the neutron data (hanion = 1.53 ˚A, TableI)
is well within the usual discrepancy, giving strong support for
the latter and strongly disfavoring the much larger value from
XRD (hanion = 1.738 ˚A [26]). The relaxation of both sites,
As and Cu, yields essentially the same results, see Fig. 12.

FIG. 12. Dependence of the arsenic height hAs (green) and

experimental and relaxed atom positions of CuyFeAs. Experimental
atomic positions are obtained from neutron powder diffraction data.
We conclude that an accurate As position is crucial for the
description of the magnetic moment in CuFeAs, whereas the
details of the Cu position have only a minor inﬂuence.
The magnetic moments for unrelaxed (experimental) and
relaxed Cu data points have almost the same values. Due to
the larger Fe-As distance they are comparatively large and
vary in a range of 0.6–0.35 μB/Fe for a formal Cu occupancy
lower than 1.05. At the critical region between 1.05 < y <
1.1 (electron doping) magnetism collapses and the compound
becomes nonmagnetic for y > 1.1. Almost the same behavior,
though shifted by ≈13% with respect to the Cu occupancy, is
obtained for the magnetic moments for relaxed As and relaxed
As and Cu positions. Their critical Cu occupancy values lie
at y ≈0.92 and induce a kink in the hAs position curve. This
shows the presence of a sizable coupling of magnetic moments
and lattice in this compound.
A closer look onto the related changes of the calculated non-
magnetic (As and Cu relaxed) DOS reveals sizable differences
in the number of Fe-3d states at the Fermi level. Similar to
Ba1−xKx(Fe1−yCoy)2As2 [54], there are two different regions:
For y = 0.8 and 0.85 the Fe-3d DOS values lie between 1.94
and 1.90 states/eV/f.u. and thereby fulﬁll the Stoner criterion
[N(EF) ⩾1/I with I ∼1 ± 0.1 for Fe-3d states] [56]. For
the second region with Cu occupancy between y = 0.9
and stoichiometric CuFeAs the Fe-3d contribution decreases
rapidly. The values between 1.64 and 1.43 states/eV/f.u. are
far from fulﬁlling the criterion and therefore the magnetism is
disfavored.
In contrast to previous samples, where Cu deﬁciency was
observed, our samples show a partial substitution of Cu by
Fe. To study the local inﬂuence of Cu-Fe-replacement we
constructed a supercell containing 25% Fe on the Cu site (lower
panel in Fig. 13, purple colored atom in inset). The total density
of states of the low lying valence states (not shown) show a
rigid bandlike behavior for a large part of the valence states.
Especially states with dominating As and Cu contribution at
the band bottom are rigidly shifted to higher energies by about
130 meV. With respect to the VCA, modeling the hole doping
for Cu deﬁciency, the change in the averaged crystal potential

(for 25% Fe) corresponds to a Cu occupation y ∼0.85 (comp.
Fig. 12).
In contrast to the low lying bands, the states in the vicinity
of the Fermi level strongly differ from a rigid band behavior.
Here the substituted Fe [Fe(4), see inset Fig. 13] forms a rather
localized state, yielding a DOS peak close to the Fermi energy
(see upper panel in Fig. 13 and inset). Fig. 13 also visualizes
the strong hybridization of the additional Fe(4) atom with
the nearest Fe atoms (Fe(5) showing a similar, though less
pronounced peak), while to the more distant Fe(6) layer shows
essentially no hybridization effects.
However, compared to the experimental determined Fe
excess of 10–13 %, our supercell contains about twice the
amount of excess Fe [57]. Thus, for the averaged crystal
potential (compared to VCA) the realistic Fe excess should
correspond to a Cu content close to the magnetic instability for
the original Fe sites (see Fig. 12). Experimentally, no structural
order of the excess Fe was observed. For randomly distributed
excess Fe, the original Fe sites have in average only about
one neighboring excess Fe atom. This leads to the question
how stable the localized Fe(4) state is with respect to the
smaller Fe(4) excess. Therefore, we analyzed the contributing
orbitals and found that the localized Fe(4) state is dominated
by its out-of-plane orbitals [similar, but less pronounced for
Fe(5)]. One would expect that the dilution of Fe(4) atoms in the
layer will mainly affect the Fe(4) in-plane states (since they
are strongly interacting with the neighboring in-plane Fe(4)
which are partially removed upon dilution). In consequence,
the dilution effect on the out-of-plane states should be weak,
therefore only slightly change height and position of the Fe(4)
related DOS peak.
To understand the inﬂuence of the Fe substitution on the
magnetism more qualitatively, we also performed a spin-
polarized calculation for the Fe-excess super cell. As expected
from the (nonmagnetic) DOS peak close to EF, the substituted
Fe(4) generates a rather large local magnetic moment. For
25% Fe excess, the Fe(4) moment reaches a value of about
2.5 μB/Fe, while the Fe(5) and Fe(6) show a magnetic moment
of about 0.8 and −0.7 μB/Fe, respectively. Relaxation of the
Fe(4) atom with respect to the total energy yields essentially
the same result for the site moment: Fe(4) = 2.7 μB and
Fe(5) = 0.7μB, while Fe(6) is reduced to −0.4 μB. Taking
into account the experimentally observed dilution of Fe(4)
atoms [in average one Fe(4) neighbor], the averaged magnetic
moment of Fe(5) and Fe(6) should be further reduced.
In conclusion, our super-cell calculations ﬁnd that the
excess Fe brings the original Fe layers near the magnetic
instability due to effective hole doping (Fig. 12). The effect
is enhanced by local polarization due to hybridization of the
excess Fe with the neighboring regular Fe atoms and a rather
large magnetic moment of the excess Fe.
H. Zero ﬁeld M¨ossbauer spectroscopy on CuFeSb
The zero ﬁeld M¨ossbauer spectra of CuFeSb consist of
three different signals: two signals that arise from magnetically
ordered sites and the third from a FexSb impurity phase
(Fig. 14). The latter can be identiﬁed according to its transition
temperatures below TN ≲60 K (corresponding to x ≳1.3)
and the estimated magnetic splitting of ≈3 mm/s at 4.2 K
[58,59]. Because of the distribution of x in this foreign phase,
there is no well deﬁned sextet observed. This phase was
modeled by a broad doublet. It accounts for the increased

absorption in the central part of the spectrum. The signal
fraction of FexSb ranges between 15% and 20%.
According to Qian et al. [24] in CuFeSb there exists
Cu/Fe-site disorder. We act on the assumption that the outer
sextet signal corresponds to an iron site within the CuSb plane.
Thus, the iron moment is enhanced in the Sb neighborhood.
Furthermore, the principal component of the EFG, which
was assumed axially symmetric for simplicity, is temperature
independent and possesses an average value of −10(1) V/ ˚A
2
for the main iron site and an average angle between the
principal axis of the EFG and the magnetic moments of 78(6)◦.
The median angle lies at 89◦. The outer sextet was modeled
with Vzz = 0, as a further degree of freedom concerning the
EFG prohibits a precise determination of the outer magnetic
hyperﬁne ﬁeld and leads to unphysical isomer shift values. The
signal fraction of this outer sextet increases from 7% to 12%,
which is theoretically described by a lower Debye temperature
compared to the main site.
As shown in Fig. 15, the magnetic order parameters of
the two sextet sites scale by a factor of 1.62(3). With a
ﬁxed transition temperature TC = 375 K, a rather low critical
exponent βcrit = 0.17(1) can be assigned to both sextet sites
simultaneously. It supports the picture of a 2D ferromagnetism
within the ab plane, as suggested earlier [24]. Qian et al. [24]
discussed the signiﬁcance of the increase of the iron moment
below 100 K. Such an increase is not present in the M¨ossbauer
data (Fig. 15). The saturated moment of ≈1.6 μB observed by
Qian et al. leads to a conversion ratio of 10 T/μB at the regular
iron site.
The inner sextet shows a deviation from the expected
3:2:1:1:2:3 pattern for the powder fractions for the following
reasons. First the thick absorber preparation leads to a leveling
of the line intensities. Secondly there exists a distribution of
internal ﬁelds according to the composition of the next nearest
neighbor environment, which is subject to Fe-Cu disorder. This
distribution was modeled as Gaussian, using ﬁve subspectra
representing a Gaussian width of σhyp = 0.065(3)Bhyp. As
the outer sextet’s linewidth will be affected more by the
distribution of ﬁelds, this results in a decreased height of the

increases the absorption in the central part of the spectrum.
I. Transverse ﬁeld M¨ossbauer spectroscopy of CuFeSb
CuFeSb was characterized as a soft ferromagnet [24], i.e., it
is easily polarizable at small ﬁelds. In M¨ossbauer spectroscopy
this polarization presents itself in two aspects: First the well
known 3:2:1:1:2:3 intensity ratio of the sextet lines is valid for
a powder sample, but a polarized sample shows a 3:4:1:1:4:3 or
3:0:1:1:0:3 pattern for TF and LF measurements, respectively.
Second, as the moments will be well aligned parallel to the
ﬁeld, and not preferentially to an anisotropy axis or plane, there
will be no additional ﬁeld distribution due to the vector addition
of internal ﬁeld Bhyp and external ﬁelds Bex. Instead, the total
ﬁeld sensed by the iron nuclei is simply the difference of Bhyp
and Bex, as the Fermi contact interaction has a negative sign.
Our M¨ossbauer measurements at 2.1 K conﬁrm these
expectations: The total splitting of both sextets decreases
simultaneously and linearly by the value of the applied ﬁeld
(Fig. 16), disregarding a constant offset of 0.5(1) T in both
sextets due to the demagnetizing ﬁeld in powders [60]. In this

model the impurity again was modeled as a broad peak. It turns
out that the width of this peak is minimal at Bex = 3 T. This
is in line with the antiferromagnetic character of the FexSb
impurity phase, which in principle can be responsible for such
an intermediate narrowing.
However, for Bex ⩾4.6 T there is an anomaly on the
left side of the main sextet (Fig. 16). We tried to model
this subspectrum by means of Bhyp-MEM on top of the
randomly distributed EFG within the applied ﬁeld as described
for CuFeAs. In Fig. 17 the resulting distribution ρ(Bhyp) is
shown. According to the ZF analysis ρ(Bhyp) is Gaussian
at low ﬁeld but becomes asymmetric at higher ﬁelds. This
advanced model substantially improves the ﬁt, but due to the
absence of anomaly in magnetization measurements [24] this
partial increase of the moments of ≈10% in high ﬁelds is
questionable.
IV. DISCUSSION
The local probe investigations of our CuFeAs specimens
indicate static magnetic order below 11 K with a short
range coherence length, rendering the investigation of the
micromagnetic structure impossible by means of neutron
diffraction. The gradual increase of both Bhyp (Fig. 2) in
M¨ossbauer spectroscopy and λT (Fig. 6) in μSR support the
picture of a magnetically inhomogeneous system, even though
the complete CuFeAs phase orders (Fig. 7). Transverse ﬁeld
experiments of both techniques reveal that the size of the
magnetic order parameter varies by one order of magnitude.
The application of an external ﬁeld shifts the onset of line
broadening to substantially higher temperatures, suggesting
a ferromagnetic character of the magnetism. However, this
is inconsistent with high ﬁeld (6.3 T) experiments, where
the regular iron sites seem to be either antiferromagnetic
or paramagnetic, depending on the inﬂuence of neighboring
secondary iron, but not ferromagnetic.
WDX experiments indicate that 9% of the Cu sites are
occupied by Fe. A reinvestigation of the neutron diffraction
data allows for such a mixing without loss of goodness of ﬁt,
if an insigniﬁcant total deﬁciency of 3% at the Cu site was
assumed. Such a deﬁciency can occur in LiFeAs [61,62] and
was discussed for the case of NaFeAs [63]. The studies of Qian
et al. [27] are indeed based on a strongly Cu deﬁcient CuFeAs.
However, the WDX results disfavor a real total deﬁciency of
the Cu site.
The 9% secondary Fe are in line with M¨ossbauer spec-
troscopy, where an additional doublet is seen at higher tem-
perature, which than contributes a broad magnetic component
below 11 K. The hyperﬁne parameters of the corresponding
M¨ossbauer subspectra are similar to the secondary site in
Fe2As. In contrast to the antiferromagnetic [44] Fe2As the
excess iron in our CuFeAs samples is—according to our
super-cell calculation—in a localized state which provides
a ferromagnetic response upon an external ﬁeld. Still, not
all secondary iron show this ferromagnetism, a critical local
iron concentration seems to be crucial for the local moment
formation.
Our theoretical analysis draws attention to the important
effect of charge doping that evolves from total Cu deﬁciency
and Fe/Cu substitution. The Cu deﬁciency alone corresponds
to hole doping and stabilizes a magnetic ground state of the
FeAs layer with a moment of ≈0.4 μB, which is in excellent
agreement with the results of Qian et al. [24].
In contrast to the effective electron doping by excess iron
in FeTe, LiOHFeSe [64], or LiFeAs [62] the secondary iron in
CuFeAs acts as a hole donor which drives the original Fe layers
close to the magnetic instability. This effect is enhanced by
local polarization due to hybridization of secondary Fe with Fe
atoms in the adjacent Fe-As layer and the rather large magnetic
moment of the neighboring secondary Fe. However, 84% of
regular Fe atoms have no or only one secondary Fe neighbor
(according to binomial distribution). That means that the vast
majority of regular Fe atoms is only weakly inﬂuenced by this
local effect. These theoretical results allow for the following
conclusion: depending on the secondary iron concentration the
regular iron sites in CuFeAs have either an ordered magnetic
moment of ≈0.4 μB or are paramagnetic (ground state of
stoichiometric CuFeAs), both in agreement with high ﬁeld
M¨ossbauer spectroscopy. From the M¨ossbauer perspective the
partial presence of small magnetic moments at the regular Fe
sites is probable.
So far the interpretation suggests that both small magnetic
moments (≈0.4 μB) at the regular site and large moments
(≳1 μB) at the secondary 2c site are present. We attribute
the saturation moment of ≈0.2 μB/Fe seen in magnetization
measurements mainly to the ferromagnetic secondary iron. In
that sense that number corresponds to ≈2 μB/Fe2nd, which
lies between the values obtained in M¨ossbauer spectroscopy
(≈1 μB) andpredictedtheoretically(2.5 μB). InμSR thetrans-
verse damping rate of λT = 65 μs−1 corresponds to a charac-
teristic ﬁeld of 76 mT. This is the characteristic ﬁeld expected
from a stripe AFM (typically observed in iron arsenides) order
with 0.4 μB magnetic moments. On the other hand 1.2 μB
secondary iron moments cause the same ﬁelds at the traditional
muon site 0.6 ˚A above the iron plane. In that sense the
μSR data are consistent with both explanations of magnetism.
Furthermore, the two contributions may be the reason why a
two component ﬁt works for the magnetic volume fraction fmag
in μSR (Fig. 7). In M¨ossbauer spectroscopy the signature of
two origins of magnetism is the temperature dependence of Btot
(Fig. 2) which shows almost a plateau between 8 K and 15 K:
The increase above 15 K is obviously related to transferred
hyperﬁne ﬁeld of the secondary iron moments, whereas below
8 K the AFM order of regular iron starts. Transferred hyperﬁne
ﬁelds are probably responsible for the 0.15 T larger Bhyp
observed in the μSR sample, where the excess iron content
is enhanced (Sec. III F) compared to the neutron sample.
The coupling of regular and secondary Fe shown in our
calculation may explain why both iron sites order at roughly
the same temperature of 11 K in CuFeAs. We note that this
transition temperature is comparable to (Li1−yFeyOH)FeSe
[65,66]: In that compound ferromagnetism occurs at a temper-
ature of 10 K from a randomly distributed, small amount of
secondary iron at interlayer position as well. The importance of
the coupling of regular and secondary iron sites can be adopted
to the structurally related CuFeSb, where both the (Sb,Fe)
mixing and a strong coupling of the magnetic order parameters
(Fig. 15) are easily observed in M¨ossbauer spectroscopy.
The strong coupling of the magnetic order parameters
of the regular Fe site and the secondary site in a 111

compound is the salient experimental result of the CuFeSb
investigations. We were able to reveal the two-dimensional
character of magnetic interactions and the alignment of
soft ferromagnetic moments in the ab plane. The magnetic
order parameter shows a smooth temperature dependence
and thus excludes a steplike behavior, which had come into
consideration in neutron measurements [24]. The conversion
ratio of M¨ossbauer hyperﬁne ﬁeld and magnetic moment
determined from neutron diffraction is −10 T/μB. This is
less than the typical value of iron arsenides/chalcogenides
[40], approaching the value of −13 T/μB for a predominant
core contribution [67], which is typically observed in more
localized systems. The localization—or reduced covalency—
caused by the large Fe-Sb bond distance of 2.69 ˚A [24]
becomes apparent with regard to the M¨ossbauer isomer shift
δ(T →0) = 0.63 mm/s with respect to room temperature
iron, which is 0.1 mm/s more than CuFeAs, amongst many
other iron arsenides. The difference in magnitude (60%) of
the iron magnetic moment at the regular site and at the 2c site
is in qualitative agreement with the supercell calculation for
CuFeAs. Because of the more localized character of the regular
iron site a classical explanation in terms of crystal ﬁeld seems
applicable: The regular iron site corresponds to a tetrahedral
site with strong bonding to the Sb ions and thus a strong crystal
ﬁeld, which favors an intermediate spin state, whereas the iron
at the copper site in octahedral symmetry might only sense
small crystal ﬁeld splitting and thus a high spin state might be
preferred.
CuFeSb was known to support the uniﬁed picture of
anion height dependent magnetism [18,20]. Due to ambiguous
crystallographic and magnetic data such a statement was
questionable for CuFeAs so far. Our neutron diffraction data
now show that the structural parameters of CuFeAs (Table I,
hanion = 1.53 ˚A, α2× = 101.3◦) are close to those of LiFeAs
[1,68] (hanion = 1.51 ˚A, α2× = 103.1◦). Both structural data
and the crucial role of hanion for magnetism are conﬁrmed
by our theoretical calculations. The rather small anion height
disfavors the formation of a large Fe moment for the reg-
ular Fe site in the Fe-As layer. Our experimental data are
inconsistent with ferromagnetism at the regular iron site.
Eventually, CuFeAs follows the principles of anion height
driven magnetism. Beyond that, our investigation unveils that
a proper determination of structural data and stoichiometry is
fundamental for the understanding of divergent behavior of
imperfect samples. In our case (Cu,Fe) substitution occurs
in both batches in the same quantity, causing localized
ferromagnetic secondary Fe, eventually changing the ground
state from a paramagnetic to an AFM ordered one via hole
doping, and ﬁnally prohibiting long range order.
V. SUMMARY
We investigated the magnetism of CuFeAs and CuFeSb
using microscopic local probe techniques and theoretical
calculations. In both compounds ≈10% of the Cu sites are
occupied by Fe. In both compounds these secondary iron
atoms carry larger moments than the regular site, while both
order parameters are strongly coupled. The large anion height
in CuFeSb is consistent with the ferromagnetic ground state
with a large moment. In CuFeAs short-range order of weak
magnetic moments (<0.4 μB) at the regular site is observed
below 11 K. This is consistent with our DFT calculation
predicting a magnetic instability of CuFeAs caused by a
relatively small arsenic height of ≈1.5 ˚A, and enhanced by
the hole doping effect of secondary iron.

[56] Although the Stoner criterion is designed for the description of
ferromagnetic states, it is in many cases a good indicator for the
instability toward any kind of band magnetism, see for instance
Ref. [54].
[57] Due to the large crystallographic cell and low symmetry for
the simulation of the respective experimental Fe excess, the
calculations converge only badly. Thus we restricted ourselves
to 25% Fe excess.
