While the spin dynamics of La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 in the ferromagnetic phase are known to be unconventional,
previous measurements have yielded contradictory results regarding the damping of spin wave excitations.
Neutron spectroscopy measurements on a sample with a transition temperature of Tc = 257 K, higher than most
single crystals, unambiguously reveal an anomalous increase in spin wave damping for excitations approaching
the Brillouin zone boundary along the [100] direction that cannot be explained as an artifact due to a noninteracting
phonon branch. Spin waves throughout the (HK0) plane display a common trend where the spin wave damping
is dependent upon the excitation energy, increasing for energies above roughly 15 meV and reaching a full width
at half maximum of at least 20 meV. The results are consistent with a model of intrinsic spatial inhomogeneity
with phase separated regions approximately 18 ˚A in size persisting over a large range of temperatures below Tc.

I. INTRODUCTION
Hole-doped
perovskite
manganites
of
the
form
L1−xAxMnO3
(where L is a trivalent lanthanide ion
and A is a divalent alkaline earth ion) [1,2] display a range
of unusual physical properties arising from intrinsic spatial
inhomogeneities such as nanoscale phase separation [3,4] and
polarons [5,6]. While much of the interest in these materials
has been concentrated on the colossal magnetoresistance
(CMR)
observed
at
the
combined
ferromagnetic
and
metal-insulator phase transition, the spin dynamics observed
in these compounds in the ferromagnetic regime are also
unconventional and cannot be fully explained by a simple
model of a nearest-neighbor Heisenberg ferromagnet [7,8].
The spin wave dispersion is signiﬁcantly softened near the
zone boundary when compared to the low-q spin wave
stiffness [9–11] and is often ﬁt to a phenomenological
model of ﬁrst- and fourth-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic
interactions J1 and J4 [12]. Signiﬁcant broadening of the spin
wave excitations has been observed in several compounds
[9,13],
particularly
for
large-q
excitations
approaching
the Brillouin zone boundary. These unconventional spin
behaviors are generally more pronounced in samples near
optimal doping (x ≈0.3) and in compounds with a lower Tc
such as La1−xCaxMnO3 (LCMO) or Nd1−xSrxMnO3 [14].
These trends point to a connection between unconventional
spin behaviors and colossal magnetoresistance, as a more
pronounced CMR effect is generally present in these same
materials.
La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 is a particularly important compound to
understand. The observed CMR effect is signiﬁcant [15]. La3+
is nonmagnetic, and the ionic radii of La3+ and Ca2+ are quite
similar so that σ 2
A, the variance in A-site ionic radius and a
common measure of structural disorder, is relatively small and
*helton@usna.edu
†jeffrey.lynn@nist.gov
all evidence indicates that the A site is randomly occupied. The
ferromagnetic transition is also unconventional. At tempera-
tures approaching Tc, spectral weight is shifted from spin wave
excitations into a quasielastic spin-diffusive component, and
the spin wave stiffness renormalizes to a softer value but does
not vanish at the weakly ﬁrst-order phase transition [16,17].
Short-range ferromagnetic spin correlations, taking the form of
ridges of strong scattering running along [100]-type directions
in momentum space, are observed near and above Tc [18]; a
simple model associating this scattering component with the
magnetic part of diffuse polarons qualitatively describes the
data [19].
The current literature contains several conﬂicting results
regarding spin wave broadening in x = 0.3 LCMO. Dai et al.
[11] initially reported that at T = 10 K the spin wave damping
at ⃗Q = (0,0,1 + ξ) increased anomalously for ξ ⩾0.3. This
position in momentum space also corresponds to a crossing
between the spin wave branch and an optical phonon, so the
broadening was attributed to strong magnetoelastic coupling.
However, experiments on manganite materials have not found
evidence of signiﬁcant coupling at the crossing between the
spin wave and phonon branches [20–22]. The lattice and mag-
netic degrees of freedom are however coupled in the polaron
regime above Tc [23], and in a variety of manganite compounds
the local distortions in the crystallographic position of oxygen
atoms have been found to increase at Tc [24,25] while acoustic
phonons in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 soften and broaden when heated
through Tc [26]. A later work by Ye et al. [12] reported
signiﬁcantly damped excitations, with  (the full width at
half maximum, FWHM) reaching 20 meV along the [110]
direction and 60 meV along the [111] direction, but no abrupt
change in broadening. An additional work by Moussa et al.
[21] reported a similar broadening in raw data but analyzed
the data as consisting of noninteracting spin wave and phonon
branches that lie next to each other. In this analysis the spin
waves were claimed to neither mix with the phonon branch
nor damp anomalously, with  ≈0.24¯hω for excitations along
the [001] direction. Polarized neutron scattering was used to

demonstrate that the broad linewidths observed in spin wave
excitations at ⃗Q = (ξ,ξ,2) with ξ = 0.3 to 0.5 are intrinsic
to the magnetic scattering cross section [22]. In this paper
we will show an abrupt increase in spin wave broadening for
excitations at energies exceeding ≈15 meV. While there is
apparently sample dependence in measurements of spin wave
damping the sample used in this study displays a transition
temperature of Tc = 257 K, higher than that reported for most
other single crystals of LCMO, indicating close to optimal
doping.
II. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS
Neutron spectroscopy measurements were performed on a
1.5 g single crystal grown by the ﬂoating zone method [27].
The crystal structure is an orthorhombic perovskite, but given
the presence of multiple crystallographic domains the sample
is indexed in the pseudocubic notation with a = 3.9 ˚A. The
inelastic scattering spectrum was measured at T = 100 K
using the ARCS time-of-ﬂight spectrometer [28] at the
Spallation Neutron Source. Data were taken at incident neutron
energies of 50 meV and 120 meV; these settings provided
energy resolutions (FWHM) at the elastic line of 1.7 meV
and 3.8 meV, respectively. The sample was mounted in the
(HK0) plane and data were measured as the sample was
rotated in 1◦increments through an angular range of 76◦
(for the Ei = 50 meV data) or 68◦(for the Ei = 120 meV
data). ARCS data in this paper referenced by the reduced
wave vector ⃗q were obtained by averaging momentum space
positions within the (HK0) plane surrounding the (1, 0, 0)
and equivalent Bragg peaks. Color plot data are averages over
±0.16 ˚A
−1 perpendicular to the plane (−0.1 ⩽L ⩽0.1) and
±0.08 ˚A
−1 in the transverse momentum space direction within
the plane. Reported widths are ﬁts to data averaging over
±0.10 ˚A
−1 in both perpendicular momentum space directions
(Ei = 50 meV data) or ±0.16 ˚A
−1 perpendicular to the plane
and ±0.08 ˚A
−1 in the transverse momentum space direction
within the plane (Ei = 120 meV data). Further measurements
were performed using the BT-7 triple-axis spectrometer [29]
at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. Higher-resolution
measurements at T = 100 K using BT-7 were performed
with Ei = 13.7 meV and 25′-10′-10′-25′ collimators [for
measurements at ⃗Q = (0.95, 0, 0) and (1.1, 0, 0)] or with Ef =
13.7 meV and 25′-10′-25′-25′ collimators [for measurements
at ⃗Q = (1.14, 0, 0)]. Lower-resolution measurements on BT-7
were performed for ⃗Q = (1.2, 0, 0) at T = 100 K as well
as ⃗Q = (1.4, 0, 0) at a variety of temperatures with Ef =
14.7 meV and Open-50′-50′-120′ collimators. Error bars and
uncertainties throughout this paper are statistical in nature and
represent one standard deviation.

directions, all measured at T = 100 K. The dashed line is a guide to
the eye. (b) Intrinsic spin wave widths as a function of the reduced
wave vector magnitude. Widths shown with solid symbols were
obtained by ﬁtting the Ei = 50 meV data from ARCS. Widths shown
with open symbols were obtained by ﬁtting the coarser resolution
Ei = 120 meV data. Widths shown with an × were obtained by
ﬁtting data from BT-7.
Figure 1 shows spin wave excitations along the -X
direction [⃗q = (ξ,0,0)], measured at T = 100 K on the ARCS
spectrometer with Ei = 50 meV. The color plot displays
S( ⃗Q,ω)/(n + 1) (where n is the Bose occupation factor).
While the linewidths are resolution limited for small reduced
wave vectors, the spin wave excitations abruptly exhibit
monotonically increasing linewidths for reduced wave vectors
with ξ ≳0.25. While an optical phonon mode is known to
be present at energies near 20 meV, it is not discernible in
this data due to the small dynamic structure factor for phonon
scattering at low Q. These results are similar to earlier reports
on magnon broadening at low temperatures [11].
The spin wave dispersion in lower Tc manganites is
frequently ﬁt to a model with both ﬁrst- and fourth-
nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions J1 and J4 [9],
though this model tends to underestimate the spin wave
energy for the largest excitation energies [12]. The dis-
persion curve for this compound at ⃗q = (ξ,0,0) is given
by ¯hω = 2S[|J1|(1 −cos(2πξ)) + |J4|(1 −cos(4πξ))] where
ﬁtted values for the ferromagnetic interactions are given by

data were offset upward by, respectively, two and four arbitrary units

lines in color plots represent the peak values of the convolution
of the dispersion curve with the instrumental resolution.
A recent work [21] measuring spin waves in x = 0.3
LCMO reported raw data showing a comparable anomalous
broadening at high q, but this broadening was analyzed as
an artifact of noninteracting phonon modes lying near the
spin wave branch. The spin wave damping described here
cannot be similarly explained. While phonon branches could
be observed in cuts through the data in higher-Q Brillouin
zones, no phonon intensities are discernible in the lower-Q
data used for these ﬁts. Further, the intensity of phonon modes
near the (2, 0, 0) Bragg position were determined and used to
estimate an upper bound to the phonon intensity near the (1,
0, 0) position; including a phonon branch with this intensity
did not alter the ﬁt results. These differences may indicate
some sample dependence of anomalous magnon damping
in x = 0.3 LCMO. The sample used here has a very high
transition temperature (Tc = 257 K) compared to most other
single crystal LCMO samples, indicating that this sample is
closer to optimal doping or contains less nanoscale clustering
of A-site dopants [30] than most samples.
Figure 2 shows spin wave excitations along the -M and
X-M directions [⃗q = (ξ, ξ, 0) and ⃗q = (0.5, ξ, 0), respec-
tively], measured with Ei = 120 meV. The higher incident
energy yielded a greater dynamic range but coarser energy
resolution. The spin waves at these higher energies are also
signiﬁcantly broadened. The intrinsic FWHM widths of the
spin wave excitations, after deconvolution with the instrumen-
tal resolution, are shown in Fig. 3(a) as a function of the spin
wave excitation energy for reduced wave vectors along three
high-symmetry directions: ⃗q = (ξ, 0, 0) with 0.1 ⩽ξ ⩽0.5,
⃗q = (ξ, ξ, 0) with 0.08 ⩽ξ ⩽0.29, and ⃗q = (ξ, 0.5, 0) with
0 ⩽ξ ⩽0.21. (Data points with a negative linewidth represent

FIG. 5. Data (top row) and simulation (bottom row) for S( ⃗Q,ω), in arbitrary intensity units, over ﬁve energy binning ranges. All plots have

same energy range but for clarity vary between energy ranges.
scans where the measured width was slightly less than the
calculated instrumental energy resolution.) Because the ARCS
energy resolution is fairly broad, we have also included a
few data points with small q using the BT-7 spectrometer
in a high-resolution conﬁguration. The dashed line, a guide
to the eye, represents zero width (i.e., resolution limited) for
excitations at an energy of less than 15 meV and increases
linearly with a slope of 1 for excitation energies above 15 meV.
This damping is comparable in scale to that reported by Ye
et al. [12] but shows a distinct inﬂection at ≈15 meV; this
damping is signiﬁcantly larger than the  = 0.24ω reported
by Moussa et al. [21]. Figure 3(b) shows the same data
plotted against reduced wave vector magnitude. In this plot the
data along the three directions do not coincide, emphasizing
the importance of the excitation energy in determining the
linewidth.
Figure 4 shows example energy scans through the spin
waves at ⃗q = (ξ, 0, 0) with ξ = 0.14, 0.20, and 0.38. The
ξ = 0.14 and ξ = 0.20 data were measured on BT-7 while the
ξ = 0.38 data were measured on ARCS with Ei = 50 meV.
Fits are shown through each data set and horizontal bars
represent the full width at half maximum of the instrumental
energy resolution, determined by projecting the convolution of
the instrumental resolution ellipsoid with the dispersion curve
onto the energy axis. The two spin waves at lower q (with
excitation energies of 7.0 meV and 12.5 meV) are resolution
limited, consistent with intrinsic linewidths that remain small
for excitation energies up to ≈15 meV. The raw data for the
peak at ¯hω = 7.0 meV ﬁt well to a FWHM of 1.81 ± 0.16 meV
while the instrumental resolution for this peak was calculated
to be slightly larger at 2.19 ± 0.11 meV, consistent only
with a small intrinsic linewidth. The raw data for the peak
at ¯hω = 12.5 meV ﬁt with a FWHM of 3.88 ± 0.29 meV
while the instrumental resolution was again calculated to be
slightly larger at 4.16 ± 0.20 meV. An upper bound to intrinsic
linewidth of this peak is estimated by shifting the measured
linewidth and instrumental resolution of this peak up and
down, respectively, by one standard deviation each. This places
an upper bound on any intrinsic linewidth of the spin wave at
¯hω = 12.5 meV as  < 1.31 meV. The higher q spin wave,
at an excitation energy of 24.2 meV, is signiﬁcantly broader
than resolution with a ﬁt yielding an intrinsic linewidth of
 = 8.45 ± 0.47 meV.
Figure 5 shows the spin wave data within the (HK0)
scattering plane alongside a simulation for several energy
ranges. The simulation, utilizing the spin wave dispersion
and damping described above, captures the observed data
quite well both in terms of the relative intensity and width
of the spectrum. Figure 6(a) shows the data for a scan along
(1,K,0) for energy transfers between 27 meV and 30 meV
(the second set of data from the right in Fig. 5). The data are
plotted alongside simulations, normalized to match the data at
K = 0.5, of the spin wave scattering. Simulations are included
for intrinsic spin wave widths of both  = 6.84 meV (as would
be expected for  = 0.24ω) and  = 14.5 meV (consistent
with our results). It is clear that a model where the spin wave
excitations are not anomalously broadened fails to accurately
capture the data in this energy range. Because the simulations
utilize the spin wave dispersion this unambiguously identiﬁes
the observed damping with the spin waves themselves and not

scan along (1.5,K,0) for energy transfers between 30 meV
and 34 meV with similar simulations. [This scan is symmetry
equivalent to a scan through the same reciprocal space point
as in Fig. 6(a) but in a perpendicular direction.] These data are
also consistent with the proposed broadening and inconsistent
with a broadening of only  = 0.24ω.
Figure 7(a) displays data from the BT-7 triple-axis spec-
trometer, showing spin wave excitations at ⃗Q = (1.4, 0, 0) at
both T = 25 K and T = 175 K. In the low temperature scan the
optical phonon branch is visible at around 20 meV; even at this
temperature the spin wave is broadened beyond instrumental
resolution. The evolution of this spin wave was tracked with
increasing temperature from 25 K to 225 K. For the ﬁts to the
higher-temperature data the phonon position and width were
ﬁxed to the low temperature values but the intensity was left
as a ﬁt parameter. The excitation weakens and softens with
increasing temperature; further, a broad quasielastic signal
appears at elevated temperatures as spectral weight is shifted
into the spin diffusive central component. The temperature
dependence of the width of the spin wave is shown in Fig. 7(b).

III. DISCUSSION
From the data presented here, it is clear that this x = 0.3
LCMO sample displays an anomalous damping for spin wave
excitations at energies exceeding ≈15 meV. Earlier reports of
a similar broadening were ascribed [11] to spin wave-phonon
scattering, though most experimental evidence points against
strong spin wave-phonon coupling. Scattering of spin waves by
electrons [31–33] and orbital excitations [34] have also been
theorized to lead to spin wave damping. Direct comparison to
the theory [35] of magnon-magnon interaction is difﬁcult in the
regime where ¯hω ≈kBT , but at higher energies this material
clearly does not display the  ∝q3 behavior found at lower
temperatures in materials where magnon-magnon scattering
is the primary cause of broadening [36]. Additionally, the
role that randomness or disorder can play in the magnetism
and charge transport of manganites has been studied for
decades [37,38] and might play a role in damping. Structural
disorder, arising from the differing ionic radii of the A-site
cations, could lead to a variation of Mn-O-Mn bond angles
and therefore increase the bandwidth of the ferromagnetic
exchange interaction and lead to spin wave damping [39].
However this structural disorder, characterized by the variance
in A-site ionic radius (σ 2
A) [40], should be much smaller in

LCMO compared to other manganites given that the La3+ and
Ca2+ ionic radii are quite similar [41]. None of these scenarios
are sufﬁcient to describe the observed damping.
The role of phase separation [42] in CMR manganites has
also attracted a great deal of attention. Results from scanning
tunneling microscopy [43] and electron microscopy [44] have
reported CMR as a percolation effect of metallic regions, with
insulating regions persisting well below Tc. Similarly, even
lightly doped samples that do not display a metallic ground
state do show evidence of nanoscale ferromagnetic or orbitally
ordered domains [45,46]. While structural disorder due to
differing A-site ionic radii should be quite small, this material
displays local Jahn-Teller structural distortions surrounding
polarons that become self-trapped above Tc when a conduction
electron localizes around a Mn3+ ion [47]. If phase separation
in x = 0.3 LCMO led to nanoscale regions with dynamic
Jahn-Teller distortions even in the ferromagnetic state, the
increased bandwidth in the ferromagnetic exchange interaction
due to bond length variation surrounding the distortions could
explain the observed spin wave broadening. A similar dynamic
phase separation has been invoked to explain the damping of
an optical Jahn-Teller phonon mode (near 70 meV) at tempera-
tures approaching Tc [48]. Long-wavelength excitations would
average over several domains and not broaden as signiﬁcantly.
The broadening along both the [100] and [110] directions
begins near q = 0.35 ˚A
−1, suggesting a typical domain size
at T = 100 K of ≈18 ˚A. This length scale is comparable to
that of both polaron correlations [6,49] and magnetic clusters
[5] above Tc. The broadening along various high-symmetry
directions is dependent on the excitation energy as opposed
to the magnitude of the reduced wave vector (Fig. 3), which
could be related to the hopping nature of the polarons [19].
The relatively slight temperature dependence of the spin
wave damping near the Brillouin zone boundary (Fig. 6)
suggests that the spatial extent of the phase separated regions
does not change strongly with temperature. This is notably
comparable to the temperature dependence of the widths of
polaron scattering measured in elastic scans in LCMO [47] and
inelastic scans in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 [50]
(which in LSMO have also been attributed to the damping of
acoustic phonons [26]), though distinct from the temperature
dependence of the size of dynamically ﬂuctuating phase
separated
regions
previously
posited
in
LCMO
[48].
IV. SUMMARY
In summary, neutron spectroscopy measurements on a
sample of colossal magnetoresistive La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 close to
optimal doping (Tc = 257 K) reveal spin wave excitations that
are anomalously damped, with intrinsic widths that rise sharply
for excitation energies exceeding ≈15 meV and reach an in-
trinsic FWHM of at least 20 meV. This width is inherent to the
spin waves and cannot be explained as an artifact of a nearby
phonon mode. The onset of broadening corresponds to a length
scale of about 18 ˚A. This is comparable to size estimates for
the nanoscale phase inhomogeneities of insulating or metallic
domains that yield percolative colossal magnetoresistance. We
suggest that insulating nanoscale regions featuring dynamic
Jahn-Teller distortions persisting at temperatures well below Tc
increase the bandwidth of ferromagnetic exchange interactions
due to bond angle distortions, damping short-wavelength
spin waves. Spin wave damping has been observed in a
variety of manganite materials, with varying details that may
defy a single explanation. However, this work clearly shows
anomalously damped spin wave excitations in x = 0.3 LCMO,
where chemical pressure is small and unlikely to have a
signiﬁcant effect.
