Neutron diffraction measurements were carried out on single crystals and powders of Yb2Pt2Pb, where Yb
moments form two interpenetrating planar sublattices of orthogonal dimers, a geometry known as Shastry-
Sutherland lattice, and are stacked along the c axis in a ladder geometry. Yb2Pt2Pb orders antiferromagnetically
at TN = 2.07 K, and the magnetic structure determined from these measurements features the interleaving of two
orthogonal sublattices into a 5 × 5 × 1 magnetic supercell that is based on stripes with moments perpendicular to
the dimer bonds, which are along (110) and (−110). Magnetic ﬁelds applied along (110) or (−110) suppress the
antiferromagnetic peaks from an individual sublattice, but leave the orthogonal sublattice unaffected, evidence for
the Ising character of the Yb moments in Yb2Pt2Pb that is supported by point charge calculations. Speciﬁc heat,
magnetic susceptibility, and electrical resistivity measurements concur with neutron elastic scattering results that
the longitudinal critical ﬂuctuations are gapped with E ≃0.07 meV.

Much attention is focused on coupled spin-dimer systems,
where frustrated magnetic interactions can lead to spin liquid
ground states [1,2]. The Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL),
consisting of planes of orthogonal dimers with intradimer
exchange J and interdimer exchange J ′, is of particular interest
as it has been exactly solved [3] to show that the ground state
is ordered antiferromagnetically (AF) for J/J ′ less than a
critical value (J/J ′)C and otherwise has a singlet ground state
with gapped magnetic excitations. Insulating SrCu2(BO3)2 is
an example of the SSL dimer liquid ground state [4–6]. Here,
frustrated exchange interactions tend to localize singlet and
triplet dimers into complex ordered superstructures at high
ﬁelds [7–9], resulting in quantized plateaus in the magnetic
ﬁeld B dependence of the magnetization M(B) [10–12].
Most SSL systems are magnetically ordered, where the
closure of the singlet dimer gap yields a nonzero magneti-
zation that makes AF order possible even for B = 0. The
metallic RB4 (R = Ho,Er,Tm,Tb) compounds order AF with
period-doubling N´eel ground states with Ising-like moments
oriented perpendicular to the SSL planes [13–16]. In metallic
Yb2Pt2Pb, Yb moments form the orthogonal dimers of the
SSL planes, and AF order appears below the N´eel temperature
TN = 2.07 K [17]. The exchange interactions J ≃5 K and
J/J ′ ≃1 deduced from the magnetic susceptibility χ(T ) [18]
are much smaller in Yb2Pt2Pb than in the RB4, and a ﬁeld
of only 1.23 T, applied along the (110) or (−110) dimer
bond directions, partially suppresses the B = 0 AF order,
accompanied by quantized M(B) steps [18–20] that culminate
in the saturation of M(B) at ≃3 T. The magnetic structures of
SSL systems reﬂect the frustration of short-ranged magnetic
interactions, and in Yb2Pt2Pb, where the Yb moments are
large and classical with strong Ising anisotropy that conﬁnes
*maronson@bnl.gov
them to the SSL plane, we can expect AF states that are
analogous to but distinct from those found in SrCu2(BO3)2
at high ﬁelds, where Heisenberg quantum spins S = 1/2 are
aligned perpendicular to the SSL layers.
The neutron diffraction measurements presented here
demonstrate that the in-plane Ising-like Yb moments in
Yb2Pt2Pb have a remarkably complex magnetic structure,
with a commensurate superlattice of ordered stripes consisting
of moment-bearing and magnetically compensated Yb pairs
with moments perpendicular to the (110) and (−110) dimer
bonds. The magnetic cell contains 200 Yb atoms, whose
Ising character results in the formation of two independent
and orthogonal sublattices that are separately polarized by
magnetic ﬁelds along either (110) or (−110). The persistence
of AF order in the surviving AF sublattice shows that the
two orthogonal bonds of the B = 0 SSL are effectively
decoupled in magnetic ﬁeld, leading to a unique high ﬁeld
ground state. The development of the AF order parameter
in Yb2Pt2Pb is mirrored in the temperature dependencies of
the speciﬁc heat C/T and the temperature derivatives of the
magnetic susceptibility χ(T ) and electrical resistivity ρ(T ),
suggesting that the stripe-ordered ground state is preceded by
the dynamical freezing of longitudinal critical ﬂuctuations that
are gapped.
Single crystals of Yb2Pt2Pb were grown from Pb ﬂux
[17]. Neutron scattering experiments were carried out with
an incident neutron wavelength of 2.359 ˚A on the BT-7 triple
axis spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research
(NCNR) [21] on 5 g of powder that was prepared by triturating
single crystals, and on a 60 mg single crystal. A single crystal
diffraction experiment was performed on this same crystal at
1.8 K on beamline X21 at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with an
incident x-ray energy of 10 keV. Further neutron diffraction
data were extracted from the full time of ﬂight data sets

obtained at the Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer (CNCS)
at the Spallation Neutron Source and the Disk Chopper
Spectrometer (DCS) at NCNR using a 6 g collection of
∼300 oriented single crystals of Yb2Pt2Pb with an estimated
angular mosaic perpendicular to the c axis of ≃2 degrees. An
incident energy Ei = 3.27 meV was used at DCS [22], for
T ⩾0.1 K and ﬁelds as large as 8 T, while Ei = 3.32 meV
was used at CNCS for the diffraction study and a higher
incident energy of 37 meV was used to to identify crystal ﬁeld
excitations.
The Yb ions in Yb2Pt2Pb have an extremely strong Ising
anisotropy that has important ramiﬁcations for the magnetic
structure that we will propose. The crystal structure in the SSL
planes [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] features Yb1 and Yb2 sites, both
having the same C2v (m2m) point group symmetry, although
the Yb1-Yb1 spacing is 3.545 ˚A, and the Yb2-Yb2 spacing
is 3.889 ˚A. Each is surrounded by six nearest neighbor Pt
atoms (three above and three below the Yb-Yb plane), and
four nearest neighbor Pb atoms (two above and two below
the Yb-Yb plane) [17]. These Pt and Pb atoms provide an
anisotropic environment of static charges that lifts the eightfold
degeneracy of the J = 7/2 multiplet of Yb3+, producing
four doublet states for both the Yb1 and Yb2 ions. We
have identiﬁed the wave functions of the states split by the
crystalline electric ﬁeld (CEF) associated with this point
charge model using the software MCPHASE [23–26], in terms of
the angular momentum jz states |± 7/2⟩, | ± 5/2⟩, |± 3/2⟩,
and |± 1/2⟩. As is evident in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), the high
symmetry directions for the Yb1 and Yb2 sites do not coincide
with the crystalline axes a, b, and c. For Yb1 sites in the
z = 0 plane, the eigenstates are most nearly diagonalized by
choosing the new axis to be along the (1, −1,0) direction, and
the resulting CEF levels are
|E±⟩0 = 0.992|±7/2⟩+ 0.100|±3/2⟩
+ 0.064|∓1/2⟩+ 0.032|∓5/2⟩,
(1)
|E±⟩1 = −0.082|±7/2⟩+ 0.300|±3/2⟩
+ 0.355|∓1/2⟩+ 0.881|∓5/2⟩,
(2)
|E±⟩2 = 0.092|±7/2⟩+ 0.785|±3/2⟩
+ 0.420|∓1/2⟩−0.446|∓5/2⟩,
(3)
|E±⟩3 = −0.153|±7/2⟩+ 0.832|±3/2⟩
−0.533|∓1/2⟩+ 0.005|∓5/2⟩.
(4)
It is remarkable that the ground state wave function is a
nearly pure state of the angular momentum jz = | ± 7/2⟩, and
it is well separated from the excited doublets |E±⟩1, |E±⟩2,
and |E±⟩3 by the energies 1 = 37 meV, 2 = 64 meV, and
3 = 94 meV. Consequently, the low temperature magnetic
properties are expected to be dominated by the ground doublet
|E±⟩0, and the magnetic moments and their anisotropy that
we calculate for the ground doublet coincide with the values
measured in a 14 T ﬁeld, which is large enough to saturate
the magnetization when it lies in the the SSL plane, indeed
indicate a pronounced Ising anisotropy:
M110 ⋍±3.95μB/Yb, measured (14 T) : 3.8μB/Yb,
(5)
M100 ⋍±2.8μB/Yb, measured (14 T) : 2.7μB/Yb,
(6)
M001 ⋍±0.2μB/Yb, measured (14 T) : 0.25μB/Yb.
(7)
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments carried out on
CNCS ﬁnd a nondispersing excitation with an energy Ec =
25.3 ± 0.1 meV (Fig. 2), that we identify as a crystal ﬁeld
excitation between the ground and ﬁrst excited states of the
CEF-split manifold of states. Ec is in reasonable agreement
with the splitting 1 = 37 meV between the ground doublet
and the ﬁrst excited doublet that was calculated from the point
charge model. Despite the metallic character of Yb2Pt2Pb,
the point charge model localizes charge on the Pt and Pb
ions, which could potentially lead to an overestimate of
the CEF splitting. At the same time, the determination of
1 ≃7 meV from the analysis of a Schottky peak in the
speciﬁc heat [17,28] may also be compromised to some extent
by uncertainties in the phonon background. Despite these
qualiﬁcations, the experimental data conﬁrm the prediction
of the point charge model that the ﬁrst excited CEF levels
in Yb2Pt2Pb are energetically well separated from the Ising
ground doublets, where the direct measurement from the
inelastic neutron scattering spectrum ﬁnds that this energy
separation is 1 ≃25 meV.
The ground state of the crystal ﬁeld manifold is a Kramers
doublet that is a nearly pure state of angular momentum jz =
| ± 7/2⟩, implying that at low temperatures, the individual Yb
moments can only be in one of two antiparallel states that have
equal moment magnitudes. The Ising nature of the ground state
is protected by its minimal overlap with the wave functions of
the energetically remote excited states. The energy of the ﬁrst
excited state |E±⟩1 ≃25 meV sets the scale for rotating the
Yb moments away from the (110) and (−110) directions in

FIG. 2. (a) Contour plot of the inelastic scattering intensity

over wave vector (HH) = [−6,6], (H −H) = [−1,1], measured at
temperature of ≃175 K and with an incident energy Ei = 37 meV.
The scattering at high wave vectors and energies less than 20 meV
is due to the aluminum sample holder and cryogenic environment
[27]. (b) Energy dependent intensity averaged over wave vector

the SSL plane, and so at low temperatures no moment canting
is permitted and no spiral-type modulated structure of the
Yb moments is possible [29–32]. Although the Yb1 and Yb2
sites have slightly different chemical environments, the Yb-Pt
and Yb-Pb distances differ only slightly, and the variation in
the associated CEF splitting of the ground manifold on the
two sites is small compared to |E±⟩1. Within the ≃3.6 meV
energy resolution of the CNCS inelastic neutron scattering
experiment, and the considerable thermal broadening of the
CEF levels at the experimental temperature 175 K, we did not
resolve any such additional splitting that would distinguish the
Yb1 and Yb2 sites. The magnetic moments are consequently
expected to be nearly identical on the Yb1 and Yb2 sites.
Magnetization measurements conﬁrm the results of these
calculations [17,19,33], showing that the Yb moments are
largely conﬁned to the SSL planes, where the moments form a
lattice of orthogonal dimers. Since half of the Yb moments can
be fully polarized by magnetic ﬁelds along (110) or (−110), it
has been suggested that there are two orthogonal but otherwise
equivalent sublattices in Yb2Pt2Pb, each containing half of the
Yb moments [19,33]. This too can be explained on the basis
of the crystal structure, since Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that

to the formula unit Yb2Pt2Pb with ﬁeld along three principal crystal
directions (100), (110), and (001). (b) Magnetization normalized
with the two sublattice model as explained in the text. The satu-
ration moment for the ﬁeld along the diagonal (110) direction is
M110(Nor.) = 3.8μB/Yb, which is much bigger than the moment
along the crystal (001) direction with M001(Nor.) = 0.25μB/Yb at
14 T at 1.9 K.
the chemical environment of the Yb2 sites is rotated 90◦with
respect to that of the Yb1 sites, and so the magnetic moments of
the Yb1 and Yb2 sites are also expected to be orthogonal within
the SSL ab planes. Figure 1 demonstrates that Yb1 and Yb2
moments are alternated along the c axis, leading to sublattice
1 with moments along (1 −1 0) [Fig. 1(c)], consisting of
Yb1 moments in the z = 0 plane and Yb2 moments in the
z = 1/2 planes, while sublattice 2 has moments along (110)
[Fig. 1(d)], consisting of Yb2 moments in the z = 0 plane
and Yb1 moments in the z = 1/2 planes. The two sublattices
together form the magnetic ab planes, where in a given plane
one sublattice is formed entirely of Yb1 moments and the other
sublattice is formed entirely from Yb2 moments.
Measurements of the magnetization curves M(B) with
the ﬁeld oriented along (110), (100), and (001) [Fig. 3(a)]
are compared to the results of the point charge model in
Fig. 3(b). Due to the strong Ising anisotropy of Yb2Pt2Pb,
a magnetic ﬁeld larger than ≃2.3 T oriented along (1 −1 0),
or (110), readily polarizes one sublattice, while the orthogonal
sublattice is nearly unaffected. If we normalize the measured
magnetization by the number of moments per formula unit
that have their local Ising axes parallel to magnetic ﬁeld,

we ﬁnd an experimental value for the saturation moment
M110 = 3.8μB/Yb, which is in close agreement with the value
expected from the point charge model, as listed above. The
Ising character of the moments is further highlighted by the
observation that for a magnetic ﬁeld applied along (100), the
saturation moment M100, is simply the projection of M110 =
M110 =
√
2 × M100. Finally, a magnetic ﬁeld applied along
(001) is perpendicular to all moments, and the small value of
M001 signals the inability for such a ﬁeld to induce signiﬁcant
magnetization of the Ising moments, which are constrained to
lie in the ab planes. The measured magnetization [Fig. 3(a)]
and the results of the point charge model [Fig. 3(b)] are found
to be in excellent agreement once the two sublattice character
of Yb2Pt2Pb is taken into account in this way.
The formation of the antiferromagnetically ordered state
in these sublattices destroys the Shastry-Sutherland lattice
that was suggested on the basis of the crystal structure in
the ab plane [17–20,33]. Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show that
each sublattice is a square lattice of dimers with parallel
moments that are all Yb1 or all Yb2 type within a given
plane, and that these dimers are stacked antiferromagnetically
along the c axis into ladders with alternating Yb1-Yb2 rungs.
The rungs on neighboring ladders are orthogonal, forming the
dimers of the original SSL planes. Much can be predicted
about the magnetic moments and their orientation from the
crystal structure itself. The essential features that we will
use to construct our model of the magnetic structure include
two sublattices of orthogonal dimers residing in the ab SSL
planes, antiferromagnetic stacking along the c axis, and a
strong Ising anisotropy that limits the Yb moments to be
along the (110) and (1 −1 0) directions, with no canting or
modulation of the moment magnitude. As we will show, a
very satisfactory description of the diffraction data is possible
using this model, and in this way we will validate the basic
properties of Yb2Pt2Pb that were deduced above on the basis
of the local chemical environment of the Yb ions.
Neutron diffraction measurements show clear evidence for
AF order below TN = 2.07 K [17]. Figure 4(a) is a contour
plot of the elastic intensity in the (HHL) scattering plane at
1.5 K, obtained on the collection of aligned Yb2Pt2Pb crystals
using CNCS. The (002) and (112) nuclear peaks are present at
all temperatures, however, satellite peaks emerge around the
(001) and (111) Bragg positions for T ⩽TN. The in-plane AF
propagation wave vector q1 = (δ,δ,0) with δ = 0.2 ± 0.02 in
reciprocal lattice units (rlu) is deduced from Gaussian ﬁts to
the (1 −δ,1 −δ,1) superlattice peaks [Fig. 4(b)], indicating
that AF order is accompanied by the formation of a 5 × 5 × 1
superstructure. The temperature dependencies of the integrated
intensities of the (δ,δ,1) and (1 −δ,1 −δ,1) AF peaks have
the appearance of order parameters that are substantially
broadened near TN [Fig. 4(b), inset], although the AF peaks
themselves remain sharp.
Our scattering geometry accesses a strip of the (HK1) plane
[Fig. 4(c)], where a quartet of AF satellites forms around both

the (001) and (111) Bragg positions. A 3 T magnetic ﬁeld
B applied along (−110) polarizes all antiparallel moments
[17,33], and due to the Ising character of the Yb moments, has
no effect on perpendicular moments. Figure 4(d) shows that
only the AF peaks with q1∥B survive at 3 T. We ﬁrst considered
the possibility that the quartet of AF satellites [Fig. 4(c)] arises
from the presence of two orthogonal twin domains with a
single AF wave vector, i.e., spatially extended regions where
the AF wave vectors are along 110 in domain type 1 and the
orthogonal −110 direction in domain type 2. The minimal
constraints that must be accommodated in the two-domain
scenario are as follows:
(i) Given their Ising character, the Yb moments can only
be perpendicular or parallel to the dimer bonds, which lie
along (110) and (−110) directions. (ii) The moment per site
can be no larger than ≈4.5μB, which is the maximum Yb
moment permitted by Hunds rule. (iii) Both domains should
be antiferromagnetic, bearing no net moment in zero ﬁeld,
except perhaps at their boundaries. (iv) All moments in both
domains that have a component parallel or antiparallel to the
external ﬁeld will reorient along external ﬁelds larger than ≈3
T, producing a saturation moment that is consistent with the
saturation moment taken from magnetization measurements,
which is the equivalent of ≈1.9μB/Yb.
There are three different types of domains 1 and 2, where
we consider different conﬁgurations of magnetic moments,
subject to the above constraints.
In the ﬁrst case, there is an antiferromagnetic arrangement
of moments, which are all perpendicular to the bonds. Given
that the bonds are orthogonal, an external ﬁeld along (110) or
(−110) will reorient half of the moments giving the correct
saturation moment. However, it is impossible in this case to
construct a second type of domain that is not the same as the
original domain, via simple translation.
The second scenario takes domain 1 to have moments on
the dimer bonds parallel to (110), and these moments can be
either parallel or perpendicular to the bonds. Domain 2 also has
moments parallel or perpendicular to the (−110) dimer bonds.
Here, only half of the bonds in either domain have moments,
and in an external ﬁeld only half of these moments can be
reoriented to give a saturation moment that amounts to only 1
4
of the moment per Yb. Since the Yb moment cannot be larger
than ≈4.5μB/Yb, the saturation magnetization predicted in
this conﬁguration is much smaller than the measured value.
The third scenario takes domain 1 to have half the Yb
moments perpendicular to the (110) bonds and half parallel to
the (−110) bonds, so that all moments can be reoriented by an
external ﬁeld along 110 to give the correct saturation moment
of ≈1/2 of 4μB/Yb. Domain 2 consists of the opposite
conﬁguration where moments are perpendicular to the (110)
bonds and parallel to the (−110) bonds, i.e., it is domain 1
rotated by 90◦. An external ﬁeld along (110) will leave domain
2 unaffected. Here, the moments parallel to the dimer bonds
do not contribute to the magnetic diffraction intensity, and our
simulations concur that the reﬁned AF moment is too small by
a factor of 2, both in zero and nonzero ﬁelds.
Our conclusion is that the two-domain scenario is overcon-
strained, due to the combination of the lattice of orthogonal
bonds where the Ising moments can only be parallel or
antiparallel to these bonds. The crystal structure (Fig. 1) mo-
tivates our adoption of a structure where q1 = (0.2,0.2,0) and
q2 = (−0.2,0.2,0) deﬁne two orthogonal moment sublattices
in the SSL plane, each containing half of the Yb moments,
as we described above. The fourth (1 + δ,1 + δ,1) satellite
around (111) is much weaker than can be explained by either
the Yb magnetic form factor or self-absorption corrections,
and this reduced intensity will be captured by our magnetic
structure model as well. We will show that this scenario fully
reproduces the magnetic diffraction intensities, as well as the
saturation magnetization and its anisotropy that was discussed
above. From a wholly experimental perspective, the presence
of two antiferromagnetic domains would likely also lead to
signiﬁcant hysteresis in the temperature dependencies of the
low ﬁeld magnetic susceptibility when the sample is cooled
into the antiferromagnetic state in either zero ﬁeld [zero ﬁeld
cooled (ZFC)] or in a ﬁeld that is larger than ≃3 T [ﬁeld cooled
(FC)], the saturation ﬁeld. Our measurements ﬁnd no evidence
for hysteresis in the ZFC or FC susceptibilities χ(T ), or in the
ﬁeld dependence of the magnetization M(B), other than near
the quantized magnetization steps [18–20].
Previous magnetization measurements are consistent with
the Yb moments being either parallel or perpendicular to
the (110) and (−110) dimer bonds [17,33]. The direction
of the magnetic moments in Yb2Pt2Pb is not constrained
by symmetry considerations, but our model of the magnetic
structure produces no AF peaks when the moments are oriented
along the dimer bonds. We conclude that the Yb moments in
Yb2Pt2Pb are oriented perpendicular to their own dimer bonds,
so the q1 = (0.2,0.2,0) sublattice is formed by dimers oriented
along (110) with perpendicular moments along (−110) and
for the orthogonal q2 = (−0.2,0.2,0) sublattice the dimers are
along (−110) with moments along (110).
The magnetic structure of Yb2Pt2Pb is obtained from the
reﬁnement of neutron diffraction data obtained on a 5 g powder
using BT-7. The 10 K neutron powder pattern [Fig. 5(a)]
is well reﬁned using the reported U2Pt2Sn-type tetragonal
structure [34]. The 0.5 K neutron powder diffraction pattern
has additional peaks corresponding to AF order [Fig. 5(a)], also
evident in the data obtained on the 6 g aligned crystal array
using CNCS [Figs. 4 and 5(b)]. The (1 ± δ,1 ± δ,0) satellites
in the (HH0) scan in Fig. 5(b) arise from Yb moments
that are perpendicular to (HH0), i.e., to the AF propagation
direction q1. We performed no scans along directions parallel
to (−HH0), however, we have added for clarity the second set
of AF satellites that arise from the moments perpendicular to
q2. The 1.5 K (HH0) neutron scan [Fig. 5(c)] shows that two
satellite peaks ﬂank each of the (110), (220), and (330) nuclear
Bragg peaks. Their absence in x-ray scans carried out on the
same crystal [Fig. 5(c)] indicates that there is no appreciable
structural distortion at TN.
The magnetic structure in Yb2Pt2Pb is quite complex,
involving two different AF wave vectors and the formation
of a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell with 200 Yb moments. Conventional
representation analysis shows that preserving the indepen-
dence of the two AF sublattices within the U2Pt2Sn structure
requires that no more than eight of the 16 symmetry operators
of P42/mmm may be retained in the magnetic space group.
P1 and P-1 are the only space groups that contain any subset of
these eight elements, but irreducible representations of these
groups place no constraints on the coefﬁcients of the basis

vectors that deﬁne the magnetic moments. As a consequence,
we have taken another approach to formulating the magnetic
structure of Yb2Pt2Pb, where the strong Ising character of the
Yb moments plays a central role. The crystal structure consists
of both Yb1 and Yb2 dimers in the SSL planes, potentially
having different Yb moments M1 and M2. As shown in
Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), the unit cell contains z = 0 and z = 1/2
planes with both types of dimers, but they are staggered along
the c axis so that a Yb1 dimer with Yb moment M1 (z = 0)
is always below a Yb2 dimer with Yb moment M2 (z = 1/2),
thus forming corrugated ladders due to the length differences
of the two types of dimer rungs.
We take these Yb dimers as the building blocks of the
magnetic structure. Since the Yb moments of the crystal-ﬁeld
doublet ground state are large and classical, we consider
here the four conﬁgurations of two distinguishable moments
(Fig. 6), i.e., ↑↓, ↓↑, ↑↑, and ↓↓, and not the singlet-
triplet states of two indistinguishable quantum spins as in
SrCu2(BO3)2. The AF state consists of two identical and
interleaving magnetic sublattices in each SSL plane, oriented
perpendicular to each other [Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. Inspired
by the stripelike structures found in SrCu2(BO3)2 at high
ﬁelds [7,8,35], we construct the 5 × 5 × 1 AF superlattice of
Yb2Pt2Pb from stripes that contain a single conﬁguration of Yb
pairs, with the dimer bonds along (110) and moments parallel
to (−110) for the sublattice with q1 = (0.2,0.2,0) and with
dimer bonds along (−110) and moments parallel to (110) for
the perpendicular sublattice with q2 = (−0.2,0.2,0) (Fig. 6).
Each SSL plane consists of two perpendicular arrangements
of dimer stripes, and both orthogonal sublattices are present
in the z = 0 and z = 1/2 planes [Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. The
principal AF wave vectors (±0.2,0.2,1) indicate there must
be a net AF alignment of the neighboring z = 0 and z = 1/2
planes that comprise the chemical unit cell (Figs. 4 and 5).
The weak (±0.2,0.2,0) reﬂections in Fig. 5(b) result from the
incomplete compensation of the unit cell magnetic structure
factor for L = 0 due to the corrugated ladder geometry. For
instance, if there is a moment bearing ↑↑dimer stripe in the
z = 0 plane [Fig. 6(a)], there must be an antiparallel moment
bearing ↓↓dimer stripe in the neighboring z = 1/2 plane
[Fig. 6(b)]. Similarly, stripes of ↑↓dimers in the z = 0 plane
must be stacked beneath stripes of ↓↑dimers in the z = 1/2
plane. For both sublattices and in both z = 0 and z = 1/2
planes, stripes based on each of the four dimer conﬁgurations
can be arranged in a total of 1024 different ways within the
5 × 5 × 1 AF supercell of Yb2Pt2Pb.
Each of these 1024 stripe conﬁgurations was reﬁned against
the 0.5 K neutron powder data [Fig. 5(a)] using FULLPROF
[36]. The Yb form factor was included in the reﬁnements,
in which only two parameters, the Yb moments on the Yb1
and Yb2 dimers M1 and M2, were varied. The computed
diffraction patterns were subtracted from the 0.5 K diffraction

elongated in the direction of the dimer bond; larger (smaller) symbol sizes indicate long (short) dimers. The z = 0 (a) and z = 1/2 (b) planes
are formed by interleaving orthogonal q1 (left) and q2 (right) sublattices, to form the 5 × 5 × 1 AF supercell (solid lines, center panels). Each
sublattice consists of ordered sequences of stripes consisting of single dimer types (different colors). (c) A fragment of the complete magnetic

pattern to generate a residual χ2 for each stripe conﬁguration.
Figure 5(d) shows that there are ten conﬁgurations that have
markedly smaller values of χ2 = 0.064, consisting of the ﬁve
permutations of the stripe sequence (↑↓,↑↓,↓↑,↓↑,↑↑) and
its mirror reﬂection (↓↑,↓↑,↑↓,↑↓,↓↓) [Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)].
The ﬁt converged to have the same Yb moment on every
site, M1 = M2 = 3.8 ± 0.2μB/Yb, which is in excellent
agreement with the 3.95μB/Yb predicted above by the point
charge model for Yb in the |±7/2⟩Kramers doublet ground
state, as well as the measured saturation moment M110 [17,33].
The simulated powder pattern with the lowest χ2 agrees
very well with the 0.5 K powder pattern [Fig. 5(a)]. We
also computed speciﬁc nuclear and AF peak intensities from
this magnetic solution, ﬁnding excellent agreement with the
peak heights found in the 0.5 K (HH0) single crystal scan
[Fig. 5(c)]. The Supplemental Material [37] contains a ﬁle of
the neutron diffraction intensity for Yb2Pt2Pb at T = 0.5 K,
and its statistical error as a function of the scattering angle. It
is provided so that a comparison of alternative models could
be made by other authors.
The reﬁned magnetic structure for Yb2Pt2Pb is remarkably
intricate (Fig. 6). Both sublattices in each SSL layer are
net-moment bearing, containing individual ↑↑or ↓↓stripes,
spatially separated by two pairs of magnetically compensated
↓↑or ↑↓stripes for a total of ﬁve stripes per magnetic unit cell.
The moment-bearing stripes in neighboring SSL layers are
arranged AF along the c axis, and a fragment of the 5 × 5 × 1
magnetic unit cell is depicted in Fig. 6(c) to emphasize the
full three-dimensional magnetic structure of Yb2Pt2Pb. The
Ising character of the Yb moments requires there to be two
identical but orthogonal sublattices in each SSL layer, where
half of the moments are parallel to (110) and the other half
to (−110). Consequently, only the q1 sublattice, which has
dimer bonds along (110) and moments perpendicular to (110),
will be saturated by ﬁelds in the (−110) direction. The AF
peaks associated with the q2 sublattice are unaffected by

ﬁeld [Fig. 4(d)], as is the phase line TN(B) = 2.07 K [33],
demonstrating that the two sublattices can be considered
independent.
While the structure that is sketched in Fig. 6 is quite
complex, a number of its essential features can be rationalized
by assuming that it is the consequence of dipolar interactions
among Yb moments where strict Ising anisotropy limits the
moments to be perpendicular to the dimer bonds. In general
terms, the dipolar interaction favors the antiferromagnetic
alignment of moments in directions perpendicular to the
moment direction, and ferromagnetic alignment along the
moment direction itself. Within a single dimer in the SSL
plane, the antiparallel moment conﬁgurations (↑↓and ↓↑) are
favored. In this way, the stripes consisting of parallel moment
conﬁgurations (↑↑and ↓↓) can be considered to be domain
walls that are required to sustain the 5 × 5 commensurability
in the SSL plane. The origin of the dimer stripes of coaligned
moments can also be understood as a consequence of dipolar
interactions, since here the moments and the stripe direction
are parallel, leading to a preferred ferromagnetic alignment
of the dimers along the stripe direction, just as is observed in
Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). Our magnetic structure is also consistent
with the decoupling of the two sublattices that was evidenced
by the magnitude of the saturation magnetization [Fig. 3(a)],
and by the observation that only the antiferromagnetic satel-
lites with wave vectors perpendicular to the ﬁeld survive in
high ﬁelds [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)]. Speciﬁcally, our magnetic
structure has neighboring AF dimers along the direction of
the dimer bonds. The nearest neighbor moments 1 and 3, each
on different dimers on the same sublattice 1, are consequently
parallel. Located in between moments 1 and 3 on sublattice
1 is moment 2, which lies on the orthogonal sublattice 2.
Regardless of the direction of moment 2, the geometry of
the SSL plane ensures that the interaction between moments
1 and 2 has the same magnitude but the opposite direction
of the interaction between moments 3 and 2. We conclude
that there is no net dipolar interaction between moments on
orthogonal sublattices, and that they can consequently be
considered to be decoupled. This too is in good agreement
with the experimental evidence presented above, that the
two sublattices can be independently magnetized. Finally,
we turn to the magnetic structure along the c axis, and
since this direction is perpendicular to the moments, which
are strictly limited to lie in the SSL planes, this implies
an antiferromagnetic alignment of nearest neighbor dimers
between SSL layers, as depicted in Fig. 6(c). Given that the
shortest interdimer spacing is along the c axis, the dipolar
interactions could be expected to be strongest in the direction
perpendicular to the SSL planes. If so, Yb2Pt2Pb might best
be thought of as a system of orthogonal and staggered spin
ladders with rungs that are formed from the bonds of the
SSL. While these qualitative arguments indicate that dipolar
interactions are likely to be responsible for the main features of
the observed magnetic structure in Yb2Pt2Pb, our estimates of
the magnitudes of these dipolar interactions indicate that they
cannot, by themselves, be responsible for long range magnetic
order at the Ne´eel temperature of 2.07 K. A scenario where a
stronger interaction, such as exchange, reinforces the dipolar
exchange along the c axis, resulting in spin ladders that are
weakly coupled by dipolar interactions, is one alternative that
could resolve this dilemma.
Consistent with the Ising character of the Yb moments
in Yb2Pt2Pb, the directions but not the magnitudes of the
Yb dimer moments are modulated by a square wave with
a periodicity of ﬁve chemical unit cells in the SSL plane.
In addition to the fundamental modulation with δ = 0.2,
we have also observed 3δ harmonics in the (HH1) scans
obtained on the 6 g array of aligned crystals at 1.5 K (CNCS)
and at 0.1 K (DCS) [Fig. 7(a)]. The ratio of the (δ,δ,1)
AF peak to the (3δ,3δ,1) harmonic is 0.122 in our model,
in good agreement with the experimental data at 0.1 K.
While the model correctly estimates the intensities of the
nuclear and main AF peaks at 1.5 K, the 3δ harmonics
are much weaker than predicted, implying the presence of
longitudinal ﬂuctuations with a temperature dependence that
follows that of the order parameter. The speciﬁc heat C/T ,
and the temperature derivatives of the electrical resistivity
ρ(T ) and magnetic susceptibility χ(T ) [Fig. 7(b)] all show
peaks with the onset of AF order at TN = 2.07 K, as well as
an additional broad feature that is centered at ≃0.8 K. ρ(T )
was measured with the current along the c axis and with a
magnetic ﬁeld oriented along (110), and it is plotted with its
temperature derivative ∂ρ/∂T in Fig. 7(c) for B = 0, 1 T, and
5 T. It is striking that the ordering anomaly remains ﬁxed at
TN = 2.07 K, indicating that ρ(T ) is affected by the ordering
of the Yb moments of the q1 sublattice, even when the q2
sublattice has been fully polarized by the 5 T ﬁeld. While the
general appearance of the broad maximum in ∂ρ/∂T changes
slightly in ﬁeld, it remains centered at 0.8 K in all ﬁelds.
The picture that emerges from the data in Fig. 7 is that
individual Yb dimers form above TN, consistent with the
intradimer exchange J ≃0.6 meV that was deduced from
ﬁts to χ(T ) [18]. As T →TN, these dimers assemble into
a stripelike magnetic structure, accompanied by the gradual
transfer of spectral weight from critical ﬂuctuations into static
order. The freezing out of these longitudinal ﬂuctuations
between 1.5 and 0.1 K and the much stronger temperature
dependencies in C/T and the temperature derivatives of χ(T )
and ρ(T ) above 0.8 K are together indications that these
critical modes are gapped by E/kB ≃0.8 K, where kB
is Boltzmann’s constant. The magnetic structure proposed
here is based on the neutron powder data obtained at 0.1 K,
where the foundational assumption of fully Ising moments
in our magnetic model is validated by the quality of the
agreement with the measured data. We do not propose here
a full description of the data at 1.5 K, where we must consider
the possibility of a structure where the Yb moments as well
as their direction have a slight amplitude modulation, possibly
reﬂecting rounding of the edges of the magnetic stripes as a
precursor of the collapse of antiferromagnetic order at TN.
The magnetic structure of Yb2Pt2Pb is based on stripes
consisting of different moment-bearing and magnetically
compensated conﬁgurations of Yb moments with strong Ising-
like single ion anisotropy. In some ways, it is reminiscent
of the striped order found by nuclear magnetic resonance
experiments in SrCu2(BO3)2 [8,9], where increasing ﬁelds
drive the SSL dimers based on Cu-based S = 1/2 quantum
spins through a sequence of discrete patterns of singlet

and triplet states, reﬂecting the frustration of short-ranged
exchange interactions inherent to the SSL [7,35]. While we
do not mean to imply there is a formal correspondence
between the magnetic structures in high ﬁeld SrCu2(BO3)2
and Yb2Pt2Pb in zero ﬁeld, we ﬁnd a much larger separation
between the moment-bearing stripes in metallic Yb2Pt2Pb,
suggesting that here the frustration may be embodied in the
long-ranged dipole interactions on the SSL lattice, as well
as the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions, mediated
by the conduction electrons. The low ﬁelds required for the
suppression of AF order, for the cascade of magnetization steps
that suggest intermediate structures of magnetic and nonmag-
netic dimers [19,20], and for the saturation of the individual
sublattices in Yb2Pt2Pb may permit future investigations of
the intermediate ﬁeld states using neutron scattering, currently
impossible in SrCu2(BO3)2 where ﬁelds approaching 30 T are
required to drive analogous modulated phases [10–12].
The strong Ising anisotropy that restricts the Yb moments
to lie along the (110) and (−110) directions has far-reaching
implications for the magnetic order found in Yb2Pt2Pb. Unlike
SrCu2(BO3)2 and also TmB4 [14], where the moments are
perpendicular to the SSL planes with a single AF wave
vector, two perpendicular sublattices are required in Yb2Pt2Pb
to accommodate the Ising moments [33], which can be
independently polarized by ﬁelds in the SSL plane. Once
one sublattice is fully polarized, the SSL motif of orthogonal
dimers is destroyed in favor of a square lattice of the remaining
Ybdimers withspacingthat approaches 8 ˚A, whilemaintaining
the same value TN = 2.07 K that was found at B = 0 when
both sublattices order. This is a very different AF state than has
been envisaged for SSL systems with Heisenberg spins [3], and
it is likely that SSL physics does not act alone in determining
the underlying structure and excitations of Yb2Pt2Pb.
