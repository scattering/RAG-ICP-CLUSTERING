Elastic Neutron Diffraction of Magnetic Weyl Semimetal Candidate 56 53 5F52 5F2 Page 1 of 3 Statement of Research 1 Background and Context In recent years Weyl semimetals WSMs have drawn extensive theoretical and experimental interest 1 Characterized by the existence of non-degenerate band-touching Weyl points WPs spin-momentum locking and large Berry curvature  WSMs have unusual optical properties and can couple magnetism and transport in interesting ways such that it allows for possible applications in spintronics  WPs require broken inversion I symmetry or time-reversal TR symmetry  Relatively few materials have been proposed in the latter category Thus far the main experimental evidence for WSMs includes non-trivial surface states  and magneto-transport phenomena all effects interpreted in the free-fermion picture We seek to explore the interplay between electronic band topology and symmetry-breaking order in magnetic WSMs with strong correlations Through neutron scattering the influence of WPs may show up in the momentum space at the nesting wavevector Q between neighbor WPs similar example has been proposed in phonon physics We propose to study the prominent magnetic WSM candidate Co3Sn2S2 measuring its magnetic structure through elastic neutron scattering and explore the connection between magnetism and underlying WPs Co3Sn2S2 crystallizes in a layered kagome structure with space group 166 5E35Z  Fig1 A DFT study leads to the proposal that the compound harbors WPs approximately 60 meV above the chemical potential  Transport ARPES 7 and STM

dip between 5G54 and 5G56  which did not show up in the heat capacity measurement 51 and may corresponds to a spin-glassy transition1  see Fig 2a More recently zero field SR measurement1 revealed two different frequency between 90 and 170 K indicating possible coexistence of two phases in this temperature range see Fig 2b The authors of 1 proposed the second phase to be in-plane AFM order through group analysis The contradictory of magnetic phases under 5G56 between 1 and 1 could be resolved by single crystal elastic neutron diffraction which is absent in the publications to date We thus propose to resolve this issue by performing neutron diffraction on Co3Sn2S2 We are also planning to measure the inelastic neutron scattering spectra of this material in order to quantify the relevant spin interactions in this system To do so a precise knowledge of its magnetic order below 5G56 is needed The magnetic structure may also reveals important information on the Weyl state of this material where spin-momentum locking and correlations of WPs may be reflected in the magnetic structure via incommensurate ordering featuring the nesting wavevector Q between neighbor WPs 2 Summary of previous characterization In collaboration with the group of Tyrel McQueen we have grown single crystal of Co3Sn2S2 at the Institute of Quantum Matter at Johns Hopkins University using Flux Bridgman technique 1 The typical length scale of our crystal is about 1 cm giving a mass of about 250 mg Fig3 a inset i We confirmed the phase purity of our single crystal by x-ray diffraction Fig3 b The good mosaicity of our crystal was confirmed by Laue diffraction seen in the inset ii of Fig3 c The bulk properties such as the resistivity and magnetization data collected on our crystals are consistent with previous studies 781 3 Justification of beamtime request We propose to conduct elastic neutron diffraction on the Double Focusing Triple-Axis Spectrometer BT-7 We will mount 3 single crystals of Co3Sn2S2 with different crystal orientations such that collection of neutron diffraction data within the H0L HHL and HK0 planes will be possible within a single experiment Neutron diffraction data will be collected at five different temperatures corresponding to T5 90 125 170 and 250 K At T5 K the system is expected to be ferromagnetic while at T90 K 125 K and 170 K there are controversial reports on magnetic orders11-1 The structural refinement of Co3Sn2S2 will be performed in the paramagnetic regime so at T250 K where rocking scans of various structural Bragg peaks will be collected Afterwards high symmetry diffraction scans will be carried out at all temperatures in order to determine the various magnetic ordering that may be stabilized Once the magnetic ordering vector of a new magnetic phase is discovered we will then proceed to collect rocking scans at various magnetic Bragg positions in order to perform a proper magnetic structure refinement Measurements at each temperature should last about 24 hours so we are requesting 5 days of beamtime After the experiment the symmetry analysis of the magnetic order will be conducted with the software SARAh1 and the refinement will be accomplished with our own code We will refine and determine the magnetic structure at each temperature and explore any hints for underlying WPs Fig 3 a Measured longitudinal
