A hidden order that emerges in the frustrated pyrochlore Tb2þxTi2−xO7þy with Tc ¼ 0.53 K is studied
using specific heat, magnetization, and neutron scattering experiments on a high-quality single crystal.
Semiquantitative analyses based on a pseudospin-1=2 Hamiltonian for ionic non-Kramers magnetic
doublets demonstrate that it is an ordered state of electric quadrupole moments. The elusive spin liquid state
of the nominal Tb2Ti2O7 is most likely a Uð1Þ quantum spin-liquid state.

Geometrically frustrated magnets have been actively
investigated in condensed matter physics [1]. In particular,
spin ice (SI), e.g., R2Ti2O7 (R ¼ Dy or Ho) [2,3], provides
prototypical frustrated Ising magnets with the pyrochlore
lattice structure [4], consisting of a three-dimensional
network of corner-sharing tetrahedra [Fig. 1(b)]. It displays
fascinating features such as a finite zero-point entropy [5]
and thermally excited emergent magnetic or SI monopoles
[6,7]. An intriguing theoretical proposal for a Uð1Þ quan-
tum spin liquid (QSL) state [8] has been made for variants
of SI endowed with quantum spin fluctuations [9–14].
The Uð1Þ QSL state [8–10] is characterized by an emergent
Uð1Þ gauge field producing gapless fictitious photons
and by gapped bosonic spinon excitations carrying the
SI magnetic monopole charge [8,9,13,15]. By increasing
the transverse interaction, the system can undergo a phase
transition from the Uð1Þ QSL to a long range ordered
(LRO) state of transverse spins or pseudospins representing
electric-quadrupole moments for non-Kramers ions [9–11].
This state can be described as a Higgs phase [16–20].
In a quest to QSL states in frustrated magnetic systems
from both theoretical [21–23] and experimental [24,25]
viewpoints, an Ising-like pyrochlore Tb2Ti2O7 (TTO) is a
potential candidate for a Uð1Þ QSL: it has been reported to
remain in a fluctuating spin state down to 50 mK without
magnetic LRO [26,27]. However, the origin of this spin
liquid state of TTO has been elusive for more than a decade
despite many investigations (see Refs. [4,13,28] and
references therein, and recent Refs. [29–31]), and is still
under hot debate [13,28]. To solve this challenging problem
of TTO, we start this investigation by postulating that the
theoretically proposed interaction between electric quadru-
pole moments of non-Kramers ions including Tb3þ [the
fourth term of Eq. (1)] [11] is at work for giving the
quantum fluctuations to TTO. This postulation is a natural
consequence of the previous unsuccessful trial and error
of explaining TTO by taking into account only the
interactions between magnetic dipole moments [the first
three terms of Eq. (1)] and the perturbation through first
excited crystal-field (CF) states [14,32], and by taking
another assumption of Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion [28,33].
Under the present postulation, two ground states of off-
stoichiometric Tb2þxTi2−xO7þy samples [34] will possibly

be accounted for by the Uð1Þ QSL (x < xc) and electric
quadrupolar (x > xc) states of Ref. [9].
In this Letter, we investigate the hidden order of
Tb2þxTi2−xO7þy (x ¼ 0.005 > xc), because the electric
quadrupolar order is more tractable than the Uð1Þ QSL
by using semiclassical theoretical analyses. Specific heat,
magnetization, and neutron scattering experiments were
performed, and these experimental data were analyzed
using quantum and classical Monte Carlo (QMC, CMC)
simulations, and a mean-field random-phase approximation
(MF RPA). The results demonstrate that the hidden order
is an electric quadrupolar order [Fig. 1(b)] and that the
parameters of the model Hamiltonian are located close
to a phase boundary between the electric quadrupole and
Uð1Þ QSL states [Fig. 1(a)], which suggests that the elusive
spin-liquid state of TTO is the Uð1Þ QSL. We emphasize
that a high-quality single-crystalline sample with a well-
controlled x value [35] enables us to accomplish this work.
An effective pseudospin-1=2 Hamiltonian [11] relevant
for the non-Kramers magnetic doublets of TTO is

Here, we consider only the CF ground-state doublet
[30,36], and neglect the first excited doublet at E ≃18 K,
since we are mainly interested in the low-T properties
below 2 K. In Eq. (1), σr are the Pauli matrices (pseudo-
spin) at a site r, σr ≡ðσxr  iσy
rÞ=2, and ϕr;r0 ¼ ð2π=3Þ, 0
[11,37]. The magnetic dipole moment μeffσzr is parallel to
the local h111i axis ezr [37]. The first three terms of Eq. (1)
represent the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interaction,
the Zeeman energy under a magnetic field H, and the dipolar
interaction, respectively. They constitute the classical dipolar
SI Hamiltonian Hm [38]. It can be approximated [38,39]
by the NN classical SI model Hm;eff ¼ Jnn;eff
P
hr;r0iσzrσz
r0−
μeffH · P
rezrσzr, where Jnn;eff ¼ Jnn þ Dnn (Dnn ¼ 5
3 D). The
last term of Eq. (1) represents the quadrupole interaction Hq.
We note that the transverse components ðσxr; σy
rÞ of the
pseudospin represent electric quadrupole (and 16-, 64-pole)
moments [11,37]. Note that QMC simulations of the model
Eq. (1) suffer from a negative sign problem. On the other
hand, thermodynamic properties away from the QSL state,
including phase transitions to the LRO phases, can be
captured by CMC simulations semiquantitatively. Therefore,
in most of the cases, we employ CMC simulations.
CMC simulations were performed up to 1024 pseudo-
spins, in which the pseudospin σr is treated as a classical
unit vector [40]. The resulting zero-field phase diagram is
shown in Fig. 1(a) for the case of Dnn ¼ 0.48 K, namely,
μ ¼ 4.6 μB [41], and Jnn ¼ 1.0 K (this value of Dnn will be
used throughout the Letter and the choice of Jnn will be
explained further below). A quantum mechanical treatment
using gauge mean-field (MF) theory shows that the
classical SI phase region in Fig. 1(a) is mostly replaced
by a Uð1Þ QSL phase except at δ ¼ q ¼ 0 [9]. The phase
diagram has two quadrupole LRO phases originating from
different ordering patterns of ðσxr; σy
rÞ: planar antiferrop-
seudospin (PAF) and planar ferropseudospin (PF) states
denoted in the classical MF phase diagram (Fig. 7 in
Ref. [11]). In particular, a deformation of the f-electron
charge density [45] for the PAF phase is illustrated in
Fig. 1(b) [9,40]. In the following, we will show that most of
the experimental data on the high-quality polycrystalline
and single-crystalline samples of TTO with x ¼ 0.005 can
be explained by choosing Jnn ¼ 1 K, δ ¼ 0, and q ¼ 0.85
within semiquantitative analyses.
Polycrystalline and single-crystalline Tb2þxTi2−xO7þy
samples were prepared by a standard solid-state reaction
[34] and by a floating zone method [35]. Specific
heat was measured by a quasiadiabatic method down to
0.1 K, using a plate-shaped crystal with a size of 0.7 ×
0.9 × 0.1 mm3 whose shortest dimension is along a [110]
axis. Magnetization was measured by a capacitive Faraday
magnetometer using the same sample. Neutron scattering
experiments were performed on NIST-BT7 [46] using a
crystal sample cut from a neighboring part of the above
sample and on ILL-IN5 [47] using the powder sample with
x ¼ 0.005 [34].
We first determine the magnitude of Jnn from the
magnetic susceptibility χexp. The T dependence of χexp
measured along the [111] direction on the single crystal
shows an anomaly at Tc ¼ 0.53 K [Fig. 2(a)]. While χexp is
dominated by the contribution from the CF ground-state

doublets, a small but non-negligible correction χcorr may
arise from higher-energy CF states. Thus, we calculated
χcorr by taking the CF parameters of Ref. [36] and using a
single-site approximation, i.e., using Eq. (2.1.18) of
Ref. [48], where the contributions from the CF ground-
state doublet are excluded. The χcorr is also shown in
Fig. 2(a). Now χgnd ð¼ χexp −χcorrÞ can be directly com-
pared
with
a
theoretical
calculation
based
on
the
pseudospin-1=2 model Eq. (1). We have performed exten-
sive QMC simulations [49,50] of the nearest-neighbor
effective Hamiltonian Hm;eff þ Hq on finite-size clusters
up to 1024 pseudospins with typical Monte Carlo steps of
200 000. The experimental data (χgnd) are well reproduced
by the QMC calculations in a wide range of δ and q, if we
take jJnn;effj ¼ 1.3–1.9 K. Note that because of the neg-
ative sign problem of the QMC simulation, the analyses
have been limited to a relatively high temperature range,
5 < T < 15 K. In Fig. 2(b), we show a representative
comparison between χgnd and the QMC results obtained
for ðδ; qÞ ¼ ð0; 0.85Þ as determined below. This compari-
son yields Jnn;eff ¼ 1.48ð1Þ, leading to Jnn ¼ 1.0ð1Þ K.
This value of Jnn;eff is of the same order as the previous
estimation [51].
Next, we confirm the positive sign of Jnn;eff and extract
the parameter values of ðδ; qÞ from the comparison of the
inelastic neutron scattering data. The previous inelastic
magnetic neutron-scattering spectra measured on the
x ¼ 0.005 powder sample at T ¼ 0.1 K (≪Tc), have
shown a nearly flat broad peak at 0.1 meV in the ðQ; EÞ
space [34], as shown in Fig. 3(a). The peak is broader than
the instrumental resolution, which suggests dispersive
excitations. This experimental behavior can be described
in terms of pseudospin waves in the PAF and PF phases, as
discussed in Ref. [37]. The powder-averaged dynamical
magnetic structure factor SðjQj; EÞ is calculated within the
MF RPA [37], which can correctly describe the spectrum in
an ordered state within the linear spin-wave approximation.
Extensive calculations in a wide range of the parameters
ðδ; qÞ show that reasonable agreements are obtained in the
PAF phase with ðδ; qÞ ¼ ð0.0  0.4; 0.8  0.3Þ [Fig. 3(b)]
and in the PF phase with ðδ; qÞ ¼ ð−0.54  0.02; q < 1.1Þ,
when we fix Jnn ¼ 1.0ð1Þ K [Fig. 1(a)]. We note that only
the cases of Jnn;eff > 0 can reasonably reproduce the
observed features for the case of the PAF phase [Fig. 3(b)].
The case of Jnn;eff < 0 gives highly dispersive spectra that
are not compatible with the experimental results [Fig. 3(c)].
Finally, we show, using CMC simulations of Eq. (1), that
the parameter set showing the PAF explain reasonably well
the observed specific heat CPðT; HÞ under weak [111] field
while the other parameter set showing the PF does not.
Figure 4(a) shows the T dependence of CPðT; HÞ under
[111] field up to 1.0 T. The sharp peak at Tc survives only
up to μ0H ¼ 0.1 T, turning into broad double peaks at
0.3 T. A full map of CPðT; HÞ is shown in Fig. 4(b). For
comparison, maps of the calculated specific heat CðT; HÞ
by CMC simulations are presented in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) for
the same parameter choices as determined above, namely,
ðδ; qÞ ¼ ð0; 0.85Þ and ð−0.54; 0.5Þ, respectively. Clearly,
the PAF case shows a better qualitative agreement with the
experiment, although with some discrepancy in the mag-
netic field and temperature scales. We note that CMC
simulations with these PAF parameters also reproduce the
experimental results of CðT; HÞ under the [100] field [52].
One may not clearly see the change of states under the
[111] field below 0.4 K in CPðT; HÞ [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)].
However, certain changes are observed in the magnetiza-
tion M. Figure 5(a) shows M-H curves at several temper-
atures under the [111] field. Two clear steplike kinks are
observed at μ0H1 ≃0.14 and μ0H2 ≃1.3 T below the

zero-field Tc. CMC simulations with the same parameters
as used above demonstrate the first kink at μ0H1 [Fig. 5(b)],
indicating that it is a crossover or a phase transition from
the three-dimensional (3D) PAF state [9] to the two
dimensional (2D) PAF state [11,40]. This means that in
intermediate fields (μ0H ≃0.5 T), the system behaves as
decoupled 2D kagomé layers of quadrupole moments
separated by triangular layers of polarized magnetic
moments. This bears resemblance to the kagomé ice state
of SI materials [53]. In contrast, the second kink appears at
a higher field than that of experiments at μ0H2. This result
suggests that higher order terms neglected in Eq. (1), such
as terms due to CF excited states [41], are required for
further explanation of the behavior at fields higher than
about 1 T.
All the above comparisons between the experiments and
theories show that the LRO of TTO is the quadrupole order
characterizing the PAF phase. Although this LRO cannot
be detected directly through neutron Bragg scattering, we
observed some indication of it. In fact, weak magnetic
reflections are observed at the forbidden (002) position and
at the superlattice ð1
2

2Þ position [Fig. 3(d)]. Polarized
neutron scattering experiments at BT7 confirm that both
of them are magnetic. The long-range ordered magnetic
moments of these reflections are roughly ∼0.1 μB, which is
too small to be the primary order parameter. We speculate
that the (002) reflection appears simultaneously with the
PAF order, whose order parameter is characterized by the
wave vector k ¼ 0 [9,40], and is induced by higher order
terms neglected in Eq. (1). On the other hand the ð1
2

2Þ
reflection, observed also in a powder sample [34], suggests
a different origin because its T dependence is different from
that of the (002) reflection [Fig. 3(d)].
Electric quadrupolar orders are related to the deforma-
tion of f-electron charge density. These naturally couple to
displacements of ligand ions [48] and may induce co-
operative JT effects and JT structural distortions [33,54].
Since the quadrupole-coupling terms of Eq. (1) are derived
as the electronic coupling but are symmetry allowed terms
under the space group of the pyrochlore lattice [11], these
may contain a phonon-coupling contribution [55]. Thus, a
direct detection of the quadrupole order (using resonant
x-ray scattering) and/or of a small associated JT lattice
distortion are difficult yet interesting topics for future
investigations.
In summary, the hidden order of Tb2þxTi2−xO7þy with
x ¼ 0.005 > xc has been studied using thermodynamic
and neutron scattering measurements on single-crystalline
and polycrystalline samples under the control of the off-
stoichiometry of x. We take account of magnetic-dipole and
electric-quadrupole moments of the CF ground-state doublet
of the non-Kramers Tb3þ ion as well as the theoretically
proposed quadrupole interaction [11]. Semiquantitative ana-
lyses of the experimental data based on a simple pseudospin-
1=2 Hamiltonian demonstrate that the hidden order is an

order of the electric quadrupole moments [Fig. 1(b)]. The
estimated model parameters are located close to the phase
boundary between the quadrupolar and Uð1Þ QSL states.
This result implies that the putative SL state of TTO studied
for more than a decade is the Uð1Þ QSL. Investigations
in the context of a Higgs transition [9,10,56] and on the
relation of it with the neighboring Uð1Þ QSL phase using
Tb2þxTi2−xO7þy single crystals [35] are fascinating future
topics.
We acknowledge K. Matsuhira, M. J. P. Gingras, B. D.
Gaulin, K. Matsubayashi, and R. Higashinaka for fruitful
discussion. This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI
Grants No. 24740253, No. 25400345, No. 26400336,
No. 26800199, No. 15H01025, and No. 16K05426. The
specific heat and magnetization measurements were per-
formed using the facilities of ISSP, University of Tokyo.
The neutron scattering performed using ILL-IN5 (France)
was transferred from JRR3-HER (proposal 11567) with the
approval of ISSP, University of Tokyo, and JAEA, Tokai,
Japan. Numerical calculations were conducted on RICC
and HOKUSAI-GW.
