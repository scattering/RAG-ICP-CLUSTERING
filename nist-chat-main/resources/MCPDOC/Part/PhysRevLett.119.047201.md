Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed to study spin dynamics in the noncen-
trosymmetric antiferromagnet α-Cu2V2O7. For the first time, nonreciprocal magnons were experimentally
measured in an antiferromagnet. These nonreciprocal magnons are caused by the incompatibility between
anisotropic exchange and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, which arise from broken
symmetry, resulting in a collinear ordered state but helical spin dynamics. The nonreciprocity introduces
the difference in the phase velocity of the counterrotating modes, causing the opposite spontaneous
magnonic Faraday rotation of the left- and right-propagating spin waves. The breaking of spatial inversion
and time reversal symmetry is revealed as a magnetic-field-induced asymmetric energy shift, which
provides a test for the detailed balance relation.

While symmetry plays a central role in imposing
uniformity on the fundamental laws of nature [1,2],
symmetry breaking introduces “the texture of the world”
[3] by adding layers of complexity to the physical laws.
In condensed matter systems, symmetry and a lack of it
determine the underlying interactions of the governing
Hamiltonian. In particular, the absence of spatial inversion
symmetry in magnetic systems causes the relativistic spin-
orbit coupling, which gives rise to many intriguing phe-
nomena such as the spin Hall effect [4], topological
insulators [5,6], multiferroics [7,8], and noncentrosymmet-
ric superconductors [9,10], to acquire antisymmetric
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions [11,12].
Spin dynamics can reveal underlying symmetry and
symmetry
breaking
in
a
system.
In
an
isotropic
Heisenberg system, disturbances in the form of magnons,
the spin-wave quanta, that embody a wave propagating
through a background medium formed by ordered magnetic
moments vary in a continuous manner around an ordered
spin structure, thus requiring infinitesimal energy as a
wave vector approaches a magnetic zone center. However,
competing anisotropic interactions arising from broken
symmetry can favor a distinct static and dynamic spin
state causing a shift of the minimum point of the magnon
dispersion to a nonreciprocal wave vector [13]; these
magnons are called nonreciprocal magnons. For noncen-
trosymmetric α-Cu2V2O7, the crystal structure breaks
spatial inversion symmetry [14,15], and the antiferromag-
netic ordering below TN ¼ 33.4 K [16,17] breaks time
reversal symmetry. The simultaneous breaking of both
symmetries sets the stage for the intertwining electric
and magnetic properties [17–21] and for the existence of
the nonreciprocal magnons.
In the magnetically ordered state, S ¼ 1=2 Cu2þ spins in
α-Cu2V2O7 align antiparallel along the crystallographic a
axis forming a collinear structure. In the presence of a
magnetic field along the c axis, weak ferromagnetism
resulting from the DM-interaction-induced canted moments
was observed. When the magnetic field is applied along the a
axis, two magnetic transitions appear: one transition at
μ0Hc1 ¼ 6.5 T is characterized as the spin-flop transition
whereas the other at μ0Hc2 ¼ 18.0 T is a result of the spin
flip [22]. Combined density functional theory (DFT) calcu-
lations and quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggest a
complex spin network shown in Fig. 1(d) [18,22,23]. To the
first approximation, the spin Hamiltonian for α-Cu2V2O7
can be described by [13]

hybridization [13,19,24]. The third term denotes the anti-
symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions D1, which
result from the absence of the inversion center between the
nearest-neighborspins[11,12].Thelasttermrepresentsspins
in an external magnetic field, where ge ¼ −2 is the electron
spin g-factor, μB is the Bohr magneton, and H is the magnetic
field applied parallel to the crystallographic a axis.
The anisotropic exchange interaction stabilizes the col-
linear antiferromagnetic spin structure and introduces an
energy gap to the magnon excitations, whereas the a
component of the DM vector favors a helical spin structure
in the bc plane and determines the incommensurate wave
vector of the helical modulation. Because of the competition
between these two terms, spin fluctuations of the dynamic
state may not be around the static spin structure, resulting in
the nonreciprocal magnons. In this Letter, we report the
realization of such nonreciprocal magnons in noncentrosym-
metric α-Cu2V2O7. The DM interaction lifts the degeneracy
of clockwise and counterclockwise magnon modes, whereas
the applied magnetic field causes an asymmetric energy shift
between the two counterrotating modes.
Single crystals of α-Cu2V2O7 were grown using the
method described in Ref. [16]. Inelastic neutron scattering
measurements were conducted to study spin dynamics using
the thermal-neutron triple-axis spectrometer BT7 [26], the
cold-neutron triple-axis spectrometer SPINS, the Multi Axis
Crystal Spectrometer [27], and the Disk Chopper time-of-
flight Spectrometer [28], all of which are located at the NIST
Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Gaithersburg,
Maryland, USA. The details of the neutron scattering experi-
ments are described in Supplemental Material [25].
An intensity contour map as a function of energy transfer
ℏω and momentum transfer Q measured in a zero magnetic
field at the base temperature along ð0; k; 0Þ shows two
branches of spin-wave excitations symmetrically centered
on both sides of the magnetic zone center (0, 2, 0), where a
magnetic Bragg reflection is observed [Fig. 1(a)]. The two
magnon modes correspond to the clockwise and counter-
clockwise rotation of spins bonded by J1 with G1 and D1
along the ½0¯1 ¯1 and ½0¯11 uniform zigzag chains (Fig. S9).
The degeneracy of these two modes is lifted by the DM
interaction, which causes the observed symmetric shift of
the magnon modes to the −k (left) and þk (right) side of the
zone center [Fig. 1(b)]. The þk (−k) mode corresponds to
the counterclockwise rotation along the b axis but clock-
wise (counterclockwise) along the spin-chain directions
(see Supplemental Material [25]). Constant-energy contour
maps of scattering intensity (Fig. S1) covering a wider

constant-Q scans taken at SPINS for k < 2 and at BT7 for k > 2, shows two dispersive branches of the excitations centered around (0,
1.75, 0) and (0, 2.25, 0). The BT7 contour map represents the intensity difference between the data measured at 2 and 50 K. An arrow

representing the spin-wave intensity along ð0; k; 0Þ was calculated using the obtained fit parameters. (c) The spin-wave dispersions of all

resolution-convolution fitting of the constant-Q scans. Error bars denote standard derivations throughout the article. (d) The spin
network of α-Cu2V2O7 is formed by three dominant exchange interactions J1, J2, and J3. Red and blue spheres represent two spin
sublattices, which are parallel and antiparallel to the a axis, respectively. Arrows and spin labels denote the order of the cross product.
(e) The magnetic excitations of the spin-chain model in an applied magnetic field along the x axis [Eq. (S1)] were calculated with
S ¼ 1=2, J ¼ 1 meV, G ¼ 0.26 meV, D ¼ 1.0 meV, and H ¼ 1 T (Supplemental Material [25]). Dynamical spin structures, which
show the counterclockwise and clockwise rotation of the fluctuating spins around the field direction (þx direction), correspond to the
solid red and dashed blue modes, respectively.

range in the ð0klÞ and ðhk0Þ scattering planes confirm that
the nonreciprocity of the magnon dispersion, which was
not observed in the recent inelastic neutrons scattering on
a powder sample [23], is only along ð0; k; 0Þ, which is
consistent with linear spin-wave calculations [Figs. S1(g)–
S1(j)], as discussed later. The energy of both modes
increases steadily with roughly the same slope up to about
10 meV, and they cross at the zone center at ℏω ∼3 meV.
The absence of crossing avoidance suggests that the
counterrotating excitations are decoupled. The energy scan
measured at the high-resolution cold-neutron spectrometer
SPINS yields the gap energy Δ ¼ 0.75ð6Þ meV at (0, 1.75,
0) [Fig. S2(d)]. The gap energy as a function of temperature
correlates with the decrease of the order parameter and the
peak width becomes broader, which is indicative of shorter
lifetime, as temperature increases toward TN (Fig. S3).
These results confirm that the excitations are due to the
fluctuations of the ordered magnetic moments. The non-
reciprocal magnons were recently observed in the field-
induced ferromagnetic phase of noncentrosymmetric MnSi,
where the shift of the single, nondegenerate magnon mode
is asymmetric depending on the field direction [29], in
contrast to the symmetric shift in the antiferromagnet at
zero field observed in this study.
To
quantitatively
describe
the
observed
magnon
dispersion in α-Cu2V2O7, we employed linear spin-wave
calculations [30], which are described in Supplemental
Material [25]. The calculated magnons consist of 16 modes,
denoted by the grey lines in Figs. 1(c), S4(a), and S4(b).
However, only two modes, which were experimentally
observed in Fig. 1(a) and theoretically confirmed in
Figs. 1(b), S4(c), and S4(d), were selected to fit the measured
dispersion. The data points in Fig. 1(c) show the measured
magnon dispersion along ð0; k; 0Þ obtained from the con-
stant-Qscans(Fig.S2).The dispersionalongðh; 1.75; 0Þand
ð0; 2; lÞ (Fig. S4) as well as the field dependence of the
energy gap [Fig. 4(d)] were also measured and used in the
global fit to obtain the relevant Hamiltonian parameters in
Eq. (1). The ratio J1∶J2∶J3 was fixed to the result obtained
from the DFT calculations of 1.00∶1.12∶2.03 [22]. The
minimal model, which includes three isotropic exchange
interactions, the anisotropic exchange interaction G1, and the
uniform DM vector D1 ¼ ðD1a; 0; 0Þ, is able to capture the
magnon nonreciprocity along ð0; k; 0Þ and the dispersion as
shown by the solid lines in Figs. 1(c), S4(a), and S4(b). The
obtained fitted parameters are J1 ¼ 2.67ð1Þ meV, J2 ¼
2.99 meV, J3 ¼ 5.42 meV, G1 ¼ 0.282ð1Þ meV, and D1a ¼
2.79ð1Þ meV. The value of the DM parameter with
D1a=J1 ∼1 is much higher than that measured in other S ¼
1=2 Cu2þ spin systems [31,32], suggesting the exceptionally
strong spin-orbit coupling.
The symmetry between the counterclockwise and clock-
wise modes is broken in the presence of the applied
magnetic field as the electron spins precess under the
perpendicular field, and if the spin rotation is in the same
(opposite) sense as (to) the spin precession, or counter-
clockwise (clockwise) rotation, the excitation energy
becomes lower (higher) as illustrated for the spin-chain
model in Fig. 1(e) (also see Supplemental Material [25]).
Experimentally, for α-Cu2V2O7 when the applied field
is positive along the a axis (μ0H ¼ þ6 T), the þk mode
(clockwise rotation along the zigzag chain) is shifted
upward whereas the −k mode (counterclockwise rotation)
is shifted downward [Fig. 2(a)]; on the other hand, if the
field is negative (μ0H ¼ −6 T), the shift of the dispersion
reverses [Fig. 2(b)]. Spin-wave calculations confirm the
energy shift in the presence of the field as shown in Fig. S5.
The energy scans at þ1 T (þ2 T) shown in Fig. 3(a) [3(b)]
display the asymmetric shift of the gap energy at (0, 1.75, 0)
and (0, 2.25, 0). Figure 3(c) depicts the same energy shift of
the þk and −k modes when the field of the same magnitude
is oppositely aligned. The gap energy as a function of field
[Fig. 3(d)] shows a linear relation, consistent with the spin-
chain model (Supplemental Material [25]), with a negative
slope for (0, 1.75, 0) and positive slope for (0, 2.25, 0).
Extrapolating the linear relation to intersect the horizontal
axis yields the critical field μ0Hc1 of 6.61ð2Þ T, at which
the energy gaps at ð0; 2 ∓0.25; 0Þ close and the spin-flop
transition occurs [22].
When the applied field is increased from þ6 to þ10 T,
the magnetic Bragg reflection at (0, 2, 0), indicated by the
arrow in Fig. 2(a), moves to the incommensurate wave
vectors ð0; 2  δ; 0Þ where δ ∼0.23, as denoted by the pair
of arrows in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). The transfer of the Bragg
intensity documented in Fig. 2(d) occurs at the spin-flop
transition reported at μ0Hc1 ¼ 6.5 T [22], and is consistent
with the transition from the collinear spin structure to the

are reported in Ref. [22]). Arrows denote the magnetic Bragg

helical spin structure with the majority of the spin compo-
nent being in the bc plane. The harmonic reflections at
roughly ð0; 2  2δ; 0Þ indicated by the asterisks in Fig. 2(d)
substantiate the incommensurate modulation of the helical
structure. The spin-wave excitations in the spin-flop state
show the minimum at (0, 2, 0) [Fig. 2(c)] indicative of the
reciprocal magnons. Hence, while the collinear spin struc-
ture below μ0Hc1 hosts the nonreciprocal magnons, the
helical spin structure above μ0Hc1 gives rise to the
reciprocal magnons with the polarization most likely along
the a axis, highlighting the competitive nature of the
anisotropic exchange and antisymmetric DM interactions.
The asymmetry between the −k and þk modes provides
a great opportunity to verify the well-known detailed
balance relation for the dynamical structure factor, which
can be described by [33]
Sð−q; −ℏωÞ ¼ e−ℏω=kBTSðq; ℏωÞ;
ð2Þ
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and the momentum
transfer q is measured from the zone center. The breaking
of inversion symmetry in the α-Cu2V2O7 crystal structure
and of time reversal symmetry due to the applied field
introduces the asymmetry between the clockwise and
counterclockwise magnon modes, with the result that
Sð−q; ℏωÞ ≠Sðþq; ℏωÞ. The energy-momentum con-
tour map was measured at 27 K and 10 T, where the system
is in the collinear antiferromagnetic states as the critical
field μ0Hc1 increases to ∼15 T at T ∼25 K (Fig. S10).
The elevated temperature is necessary to populate magnons
and facilitate the neutron-energy-gain (negative-energy-
transfer) scattering process. Figure 4(a) illustrates the
asymmetry upon the sign reversal of q and ℏω separately,
reflecting broken inversion and time reversal symmetry,
respectively. The detailed measurements of the constant-Q
scans extended to negative energy shown in Figs. 4(b)–4(d)
display the asymmetry between the neutron-energy-gain
and neutron-energy-loss scattering intensity satisfying the
detailed balance relation in Eq. (2); the asymmetry is
reversed when the momentum transfer changes from þq
to −q and vice versa [Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)], and when the
field direction is flipped [Figs. 4(b) and 4(d)].
The magnon nonreciprocity due to the DM interaction
causes the clockwise and counterclockwise modes to
acquire different phase velocities resulting in the rotation
of the magnon polarization, called the spontaneous mag-
nonic Faraday effect. In contrast to a ferromagnet [34–36],
the magnonic Faraday rotation in the antiferromagnet is
opposite for the left- and right-propagating spin waves, thus
giving rise to the net nonreciprocal phase flow in thermal
equilibrium. Taking the role of the DM interaction, an
external electric field, which breaks inversion symmetry
and lifts the degeneracy of the two counterrotating modes,
can cause magnon nonreciprocity and lead to the electric-
field-induced magnonic Faraday effect, which may find
applications in the spin-wave field-effect transistor [37].
α-Cu2V2O7 emerges as the prototypical noncentrosym-
metric antiferromagnet, in which the nonreciprocal mag-
nons were observed. Our work provides the fundamental
understanding of the interconnection between the broken
underlying symmetries (spatial inversion and time rever-
sal), which give rise to the anisotropic terms in the spin
Hamiltonian, and the asymmetry of the magnon dispersion.
The controllability of the magnon reciprocity and energy
shift using the electric and magnetic fields, respectively,

Constant-Q scans were measured at (0, 1.75, 0) and (0,

positions of the energy gap. In (c), the scan at (0, 1.75, 0) and

the same shift in energy. All (0, 1.75, 0) data are shifted for
clarity. The gap energy as a function of field at (0, 1.75, 0) and (0,
2.25, 0) is shown in (d). The critical field is labeled by μ0Hc, at
which the energy gap vanishes.
