relaxor ferroelectrics controlled by polar
nanoregion vibrations

Relaxor-based ferroelectrics are prized for their giant electromechanical coupling and have revolutionized sen-
sor and ultrasound applications. A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand
how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the
response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex
inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response
must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local
structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying
macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 −x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] –
xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic pho-
nons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer
mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local
structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh
piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening.
INTRODUCTION
Understanding how inhomogeneous nanoregions enhance functional
properties is an outstanding scientific challenge for a broad class of ma-
terials that includes not only relaxor ferroelectrics (1) but also super-
elastic strain glass shape-memory alloys (2), colossal magnetoresistance
manganites, dilute magnetic semiconductors, and some supercon-
ductors (3). In particular, the relaxor-based ferroelectrics PMN-xPT
{(1 −x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] – xPbTiO3} and PZN-xPT {(1 −x)[Pb
(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3] – xPbTiO3} have electromechanical responses that are
10-fold larger than those of industry-standard PZT (PbZrO3–PbTiO3)
piezoelectric ceramic materials (1, 4) and have markedly improved tech-
nologies ranging from medical three-dimensional ultrasonography to
sonar (5). The key features of the parent relaxor ferroelectrics, PMN
and PZN, are inhomogeneous polar nanoregions (PNRs) (6–9), which
have been invoked to explain their slow dielectric relaxation and diffuse
phase transitions (6–9).However,withincreasingPT,largedomainsform
below the Curie temperature (TC) (7), and the materials behave more like
conventional ferroelectrics [for example, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and (K,Na)NbO3].
A morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) occurs in relaxor-based
ferroelectrics, in which the structure changes from rhombohedral to
tetragonal (x > 9% for PZN-xPT and x > 30% for PMN-xPT) (10). It
is near this phase instability that the largest values for the electro-
mechanical coupling occur (4, 10–13). Peaks in the piezoelectric response
occur near MPBs and polymorphic phase transitions in conventional
ferroelectric materials [and even in a homogeneous ferroelectric with
pressure-induced transition (14)], but none of these materials have
the ultrahigh piezoelectric responses of relaxor-based ferroelectric
crystals, which have longitudinal piezoelectric coefficients (d33) that are
>1500 pC/N and electromechanical coupling factors (k33) that are
~0.9 (4). These findings suggest that relaxor features play an impor-
tant role (15), although a portion of this enhanced response also
comes from the fact that the relaxor-based ferroelectrics are single
crystals. Xu et al. (16) found that PNRs are associated with phonon
softening and argued that this may underlie the phase instability, but
how PNRs soften phonons was not explained in their study.
More recently, it was shown that PNRs form by phonon localiza-
tion (17) and that these localized phonons delocalize below TC for
compositions near the MPB (17). Phonon localization means that
some phonons become trapped in small regions of the crystal and de-
couple from the spatially extended phonons. The localized modes have
frequencies that are independent of wave vector (dispersionless), indi-
cating that they are stationary (17). The underlying mechanism was
attributed to Anderson localization (17), in which waves become
trapped by a constructive interference effect on disorder-scattered
waves (18). In this context, the static (or slow) atomic displacements
of the PNRs are the average local distortions (local relaxation) asso-
ciated with phonon localization that occurs at much higher frequen-
cies. Anderson localization as a mechanism for PNR formation was
also recently deduced from first-principle simulations (19) and theo-
retically derived from equations used to describe relaxor ferroelectric
behavior (20). An earlier model explained PNRs in terms of intrinsic
localized modes (21–23), in which nonlinearity is responsible for de-
coupling the local dynamics from the extended phonons. In this
model, decoupling occurs because nonlinearity shifts the frequency
of the local vibrations into a gap between modes, where they do not
resonate with any of the extended modes (24). However, the observed
localization occurs within the phonon bands and with characteristics
matching those of Anderson localization (17). In either case, delocalization

occurs when these same modes develop dispersion as they couple to and
move together with the spatially extended phonons, as hybrid modes.
Here, we demonstrate that the hybridization of the PNR local dy-
namics with transverse acoustic (TA) phonons results in shear softening
that enables giant electromechanical coupling (25). The hybridization
splits the TA mode into two phonons, one of lower frequency (softer)
and one of higher frequency (stiffer), as compared to that of a bare
acoustic phonon. The stiffer mode exhibits antisymmetric motion,
meaning that the PNRs move out of phase with the phonon and it
is the restoring force (coupling) between PNRs and the lattice that
stiffens this mode. The softer mode exhibits symmetric motion, mean-
ing that the PNRs move in phase with the phonon and this slows the
mode down. This behavior is known as anticrossing or, sometimes,
avoided crossing because of the way the hybrid modes appear to avoid
each other in phonon dispersion relations (26). We also show that align-
ing the local modes and local structure in an electric field can enhance
this phonon softening. In this way, the local vibrations of PNRs exert
an enormous influence over the elastic shear stiffness, and this effect
can be used to both understand and predict enhancements in the giant
electromechanical response of relaxor-based ferroelectrics.
RESULTS
Neutron scattering on unpoled PMN-xPT
The neutron scattering intensity maps in Fig. 1 (A and B) show the
phonon dispersion for unpoled PMN-30%PT above and below TC.
These time-of-flight neutron scattering maps show wave vectors along
Q = [2 + H, −2 + H, 0] for 0.0 < H < 0.4, which preferentially selects
for transverse phonons polarized along [1, −1, 0] and propagating
along [1, 1, 0] [in the rhombohedral state below TC, the coordinates
refer to the pseudocubic unit cell, which is justified because different
domains have zone centers shifted by less than 0.4% owing to the
smallness of the lattice distortions (27)]. On cooling below TC, the TA
phonon splits into two branches. The splitting between these branches
is about 1.5 meV at H = 0.24 (integrated over H = [0.2, 0.28]) (Fig. 1B,
right). The intensity of the lower branch extends out to about H = 0.24
at an energy of 3 meV (Fig. 1B). Compared to the TA phonon above
TC (Fig. 1A), the upper branch is 0.6 meV higher at H = 0.3, whereas
the lower branch is about 1 meV lower. The intensity of the lower
branch extends out to about the same range as that of the PNR diffuse
elastic scattering observed above TC (7, 28). Figure 1 (C and D) illustrates
the behavior of the PNR diffuse scattering. Above TC (Fig. 1C), the PNR
diffuse scattering forms a lobe of intensity that extends out to about H ≈
0.2 (7), whereas below TC (Fig. 1D), the diffuse scattering diminishes and
the remaining intensity appears closer to the Bragg peak (7). This sug-
gests that the PNR diffuse elastic intensity moves into the lattice dynam-
ics on cooling below TC. To further test this idea, we mapped the
intensity of the lower TA phonon branch integrated over 3 ± 1 meV
in the (HK0) plane (Fig. 1E). As can be seen by comparing Fig. 1E
and Fig. 1C [after Matsuura et al. (7) and Xu et al. (28)], the intensity
distribution of the lower branch closely resembles the lobe of PNR dif-
fuse scattering above TC, thus supporting the idea that PNR diffuse elas-
tic scattering merges with lattice dynamics. A merging of PNR diffuse
scattering with lattice dynamics is an expected consequence of coupling
the slow PNR dynamics above TC (29) to the lattice below TC.
The simple model calculation shown in Fig. 2 illustrates how cou-
pling a lattice to small localized clusters that represent PNRs (Fig. 2C)
results in two TA-PNR hybrid modes (Fig. 2D). Details are provided
in Supplementary calculations. This behavior is a general consequence
of coupling modes that share a common frequency and can be under-
stood in terms of anticrossing (26). Consider the two motions for the
TA phonon and random PNRs illustrated in Fig. 2E. Without TA-PNR
coupling, the PNR motion occurs independently of the bulk crystal
phonon, and hence the frequencies for these two scenarios can be
identical. With coupling, the frequencies of these two motions become
different. In the antisymmetric mode, the coupling results in a restor-
ing force between the PNR and the TA phonon displacements, which
stiffen the collective motion. In the symmetric mode, the cooperative
motion of the PNRs with the phonon increases the effective mass of
the oscillation, and this lowers the frequency (26). The onset of coupling
below TC (Fig. 1) makes sense because the spontaneous polarization of
the lattice engages coupling to PNRs through a dipole interaction. This
is also consistent with the ~11.5-meV PNR local mode developing dis-
persion below TC (17) because this dispersion also indicates a coupling
to the lattice. Using triple-axis neutron scattering, we confirm that dis-
persion develops in the same way for PNR local modes in PZN-5%PT
and PMN-38%PT, on cooling below TC (see fig. S1). The absence of
PNR coupling to the lattice above TC is surprising but has been ex-
plained in terms of an Anderson-type phonon localization mechanism
that occurs at higher frequencies (17–20), in which wave interference
from disorder scattering effectively decouples local regions (18). How-
ever, as discussed in Neutron Scattering on Poled PMN-30%PT, there
are multiple components to the PNR diffuse scattering, not all of which
merge with the lattice dynamics, and the situation must be sorted out
by poling the crystals (30).
Neutron scattering on poled PMN-30%PT
To explore the effects of poling on the TA-PNR mode hybridization,
the ~11.5-meV PNR local mode (17), and the PNR diffuse elastic
scattering, we electric field–poled a PMN-30%PT crystal along the [100]
direction. The [100] poling direction is chosen here because the resulting
4R “engineered” domain structure elicits the largest piezoelectric re-
sponse (31) (4R refers to the occurrence of just four of the eight <111>-type
rhombohedral domains; that is, the four domains inclined toward the
[100] poling axis).
Comparing Fig. 1B and Fig. 1F reveals the effect of [100] poling on
the transverse [110] phonons. Upon poling, the [110]-TA phonon
splitting increases from 1.5 meV (Fig. 1B) to 2 meV (Fig. 1F). This
2-meV splitting is also confirmed with an equivalent measurement
in the (1, −1, 0) zone (Fig. 1G). The lower branch of the split TA mode
also appears significantly softened near the zone center in the poled
crystal, as compared to the unpoled crystal; the TA phonon at H = 0.1
softens from 3.2 to 2.2 meV (Fig. 1, B and F, left). Even closer to the
zone center at H = 0.05, the [100]-poled crystal has a TA phonon peak
that merges with the elastic line and appears four times more intense.
The fourfold increase in intensity is consistent with a phonon frequen-
cy that is half the value because the scattering intensity of a phonon in
the high temperature limit scales as the inverse square of the phonon
frequency (32). Hence, the TA phonon splitting results in a lower
branch that is softer by about a factor of 2, and this includes the
long-wavelength modes occurring near the zone center (H = 0). Ac-
cording to the simple phonon model in Fig. 2, the increased splitting
and shear mode softening are consistent with an increase in the effec-
tive mass of the PNRs carried by the TA-PNR mode, MPNR. This sug-
gests that poling results in a larger fraction of the PNRs being carried

in this TA-PNR mode. As discussed below, it is the softening of this
same [110]-TA shear mode that enables the giant electromechanical
response.
A direct alignment of the PNR local mode (17) polarization with
the [100] poling direction is evidenced in Fig. 3 (A and B). Figure 3A
shows measurements in a transverse geometry that selects for modes
that displace atoms nearly parallel to the [100] poling direction (see
schematic of scattering geometry in Fig. 3). In this direction, the PNR
mode, between the TO mode and the TA mode near 11 meV, appears
strongly enhanced; relative to the respective TO phonon intensities,
the PNR mode is about three times more intense than that for the
unpoled PMN-30%PT (17). There is also a hint of some splitting of
the TA phonon in the cut integrated over −0.5 < K < −0.4, but this is
difficult to resolve and is much weaker than that observed along the
[110] direction (Fig. 1, B and F). The measurements in Fig. 3B are in a
similar transverse geometry but select for modes that displace atoms

(nearly) perpendicular to the [100] poling direction. In this direction,
the PNR modes are absent, and there is no evidence of splitting in the
TA phonon peak. The dispersion in the TO phonon is also steeper
without the PNR mode, falling ~2 meV lower near the zone center
and not appearing as flat near the zone edge (Fig. 3, A and B). The
flattening of the TO phonon in Fig. 3A can be understood as a repulsion
between the TO phonon and the PNR mode (the flatter mode con-
tributes a sharper and more intense TO peak to the integration cut).
Together, these results show that the high-frequency PNR modes align
with the [100] poling field and modify the TO phonon along the poling
direction.
The PNR diffuse elastic scattering also appears altered parallel to
the poling direction (Fig. 3, C and D), relative to the equivalent per-
pendicular directions (Fig. 3, E and F), indicating a rearrangement of
static local displacements. The changes in diffuse scattering occur pri-
marily in broad planes oriented perpendicular to the poling direction,
whereas the more complex scattering around the Bragg peaks does not
change, as seen in the difference images in Fig. 3 (G and H). The
broad diffuse intensity integrated over L (inset to Fig. 3H) fits a profile

Fig. 3. Time-of-flight neutron scattering measurements of [100]-poled and unpoled PMN-30%PT at 300 K. (A) Phonon dispersion measured along
Q = [2, K, 0] (H = 2 ± 0.025 and L = 0 ± 0.025). The PNR mode appears enhanced in this direction. (B) Phonon dispersion measured along Q = [H, −2, 0]
(K = −2 ± 0.025 and L = 0±0.025). The PNR mode does not appear in this direction. The data points overlaying the images to the left of (A) and (B) are from
peak fits, and the white lines running through these points are guides to the eye. (C and D) Diffuse elastic scattering (E = 0 ± 0.5 meV) measured with Q
approximately parallel to the [100] poling direction on the (H, −1 ± 0.025, L) and (H, −0.5 ± 0.025, L) planes. (E and F) Diffuse elastic scattering on the (1 ±
0.025, K, L) and (0.5 ± 0.025, K, L) scattering planes, which are the equivalent to (C) and (D) except along directions approximately perpendicular to the
[100] poling direction (see diagram for geometries). (G and H) Difference images created by subtracting (E) from (C), and (F) from (D) revealing vertical
bands of diffuse scattering. The inset data points in (H) were obtained by integrating the difference image over L = [−1, 1]. The fit is described in the text.
All measurements were made on the time-of-flight ARCS at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

displacements between atomic pairs separated by a/2 in the [100]
poling direction (33). The decrease in the monotonic diffuse scattering
indicates a corresponding decrease in local displacements occurring
with random magnitudes.
There are two components of the diffuse scattering in relaxor-based
ferroelectrics: a butterfly-shaped pattern that appears around Bragg
peaks and the broader component described above. The former has
been the focus of most previous studies of diffuse scattering in relaxor
and relaxor-based ferroelectrics (28, 34–38). Xu et al. (39) observed the
latter in the scattering from [100]-poled PZN-4.5%PT, but the mea-
surement did not cover enough reciprocal space to observe the broad
modulations across Q space. Pair distribution function analysis of
PMN powders indicates local Pb off-centering on this scale (40),
but these studies did not include poling effects. Measurements of the
local mode structure factor at high temperatures also indicate that well-
localized modes first form near the Burns temperature and then drive
the formation of the larger PNR structures (~2 nm) on cooling (17),
which indicates that both components of the diffuse scattering are as-
sociated with the same PNRs. This is also supported by the fact that the
poling-induced [100] local displacements (Fig. 3) also appear to modify
the TA-PNR mode hybridization along the [110] direction (Fig. 1, B
and F). The bulk rhombohedral domains do not rotate into the [100]
direction but rather distort along the four <111>-type directions in-
clined toward the [100] poling direction, in the 4R domain structure
(31). However, by applying a much larger electric field, it is possible
to induce a phase transition to a single tetragonal domain poled along
[100] (1). Hence, the PNR modes and local displacements are more
easily aligned along the [100] poling direction than are the ferroelectric
domains in which they are embedded, and this is expected because the
ferroelectric domains are large, static, and pinned.
DISCUSSION
The observed shear mode softening (Fig. 1) is consistent with ultra-
sonic pulse echo measurements that show a soft shear acoustic mode
along [110] in the (001) plane for [100]-poled PMN-33%PT (41); this
is equivalent to the TA phonon in Fig. 1 at long wavelengths (H →0).
A similar ultrasonic result was found for [100]-poled PZN-4.5%PT (42).
In these studies, it was argued that the soft shear mode must result from
domain motion induced by the ultrasound measurement (42). How-
ever, the phonon softening in Fig. 1 (B and F) shows that shear softening
extends to wavelengths much shorter than the domain size. From the
picture presented in Fig. 2E, we can understand that the softening orig-
inates from the increased effective mass felt by the symmetric mode
because more PNRs couple to and move collectively with the TA pho-
non. A key point here is that the PNRs are smaller than a large share
of the phonon wavelengths, and for this reason, they manifest in a way that
is more akin to an impurity mode (43) than to a macroscopic domain.
The TA phonon softening (Fig. 1) is also reminiscent of the soft-
ening observed using neutron scattering in [111]-poled single-domain
PZN-4.5%PT for the same TA mode: it is the phonons that are aligned
with PNR diffuse scattering patterns that soften (16). However, in these
measurements, neither the PNR vibrational modes (17) nor the anti-
crossing of the phonons (Fig. 1) was detected. These features were easily
missed because the ~0.3-cm3 crystal used in a previous study (16) was
about 60 times smaller than the ~20-cm3 crystals used here (fig. S2).
With this knowledge, we can now understand that the relationship
between PNRs and phonon softening described by Xu et al. (16)
likely originates from the hybridization of the PNRs with the TA pho-
non (Figs. 1 and 2).
The shear softening induced by [100] poling (Fig. 1F) directly re-
lates to the ease of the polarization rotations (25) underlying the giant

Fig. 4. Relationship between the soft [110]-TA phonon and the giant electromechanical coupling. (A) The [110]-TA phonon displacements include
a shear deformation that tilts the [110] axis around the nonpolar [001] axis. The softening of this phonon at long wavelengths (near the zone center in Fig.
1) implies a softening of the indicated shear distortion. (B) The tilting of the [110] axis around [001] also results in the tilting of the [111] axis around [001]
because it is in the same tilting plane [the (1, −1, 0) plane]. (C) An equivalent soft TA phonon involving the tilting of the [111] axis around [010] (the other
nonpolar axis) must also exist by symmetry. (D) Combination of the soft distortions in (B) and (C) rotates the [111] axis toward the [100] polar axis.
(E) Equivalent distortions in all four rhombohedral domain variants (4R) (31) distort the domains toward the [100] poling direction under the application of
an electric field, E. The [100] poling aligns the PNR modes along the poling direction (red arrow).

electromechanical coupling used in applications (4). The high longitu-
dinal piezoelectric coefficients along the poling axis for the [100]-poled
4R engineered domain (31) state are attributed to a high-shear piezo-
electric response in the single domain state (4, 44–47). This is because
the polarization rotations involve shearing of the individual domains
(1). Figure 4 illustrates how the softening of the [110]-TA phonons
observed in Fig. 1 implies a softening of these shear deformations.
The soft shear mode (Fig. 4A) makes it easy to tilt the [111] axis about
[001] (Fig. 4B), whereas an equivalent soft shear makes it easy to tilt
about [010] (Fig. 4C). Together, the [111] axis is easy to tilt toward the
[100] poling axis (Fig. 4D), and the same argument applies to all 4R
domains. The result is the large piezoelectric response along the [100]
poling direction (Fig. 4E). The alignment of the PNR modes acts syn-
ergistically with the intrinsic effect of being near the MPB to lower the
energy barriers of the polarization rotations (25) because the MPB
occurs even without PNR mode alignment. Pirc et al. (48) proposed
a semimicroscopic model for PNR-enhanced electromechanical cou-
pling, in which the interactions between PNRs are explained in terms
of a dipole-phonon interaction. However, the effect coupling the pho-
nons to the PNR vibrations, which underlies the anticrossing-induced
shear softening, was not considered.
Our results reveal that domain engineering of relaxor-based ferro-
electric single crystals (31) enhances the electromechanical coupling
for two reasons, one deliberate and one serendipitous. Whereas the
deliberate 4R arrangement of the domains mechanically facilitates
the conversion of the high-shear piezoelectric response into a longitu-
dinal response (31), the serendipitous alignment of the PNR vibrational
modes and local structure (Fig. 3) further enhances this shear response
by softening the TA phonon through the anticrossing (Fig. 1F). This
engineered phonon softening was likely missed as a contribution in bulk
measurements (4) because single-domain <111>-poled crystals used for
comparison also have TA phonons that are softened by having the PNR
modes aligned during the poling process (16). However, the underlying
cause is important to recognize because an optimally engineered relaxor-
based ferroelectric crystal should enhance both the domain mechan-
ics (31) and the appropriate shear softening (4) to maximize the
electromechanical coupling. In this context, the high-frequency PNR vi-
brational modes fully align with the [100] poling field (Fig. 3), whereas
the larger domains remain in the 4R configuration unless much larger
fields are applied (1). This suggests that it should be possible to inde-
pendently engineer the domain structure and the local structure or dy-
namics, optimizing each to improve performance.
Our work establishes the crucial role that nanoregion local vibrations
play in the performance of relaxor-based ferroelectrics and reveals an
elastic softening mechanism that is likely applicable to other nano-
structured materials. For example, ferroelastic nanoregions might en-
able the superelasticity of shape-memory strain glass alloys (2) by
inducing similar elastic softening. Thus, our work provides a new per-
spective for understanding and controlling the performance of nano-
structured materials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering
Time-of-flight measurements were performed on a large (~20 cm3)
[100]-poled PMN-30%PT crystal (see fig. S2 for pictures of crystal)
and, for comparison, an unpoled PMN-30%PT crystal (~10 cm3) using
the ARCS at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Lab-
oratory (49). All measurements were performed with the crystals
oriented in the (HK0) plane and with an incident neutron energy of
25 meV. Comprehensive four-dimensional Q-E volumes of data were
obtained by rotating the angle between the [100] axis and the incident
beam in 0.5° steps and combining the data using Mslice in the DAVE
(Data Analysis and Visualization Environment) software (50). For the
unpoled PMN-30%PT crystal, data were collected at each angle from 0°
to 60°. For the poled PMN-30%PT crystal, data were collected at each
angle from −70° to 55° to obtain a complete data set that includes Q
values in directions both perpendicular and parallel to the [100] poling
direction in the (HK0) plane.
Triple-axis inelastic neutron scattering
Large (~10 cm3) single crystals of PZN-5%PT and PMN-38%PT were
measured using triple-axis neutron spectroscopy. The PMN-38%PT
crystal was measured on the BT7 spectrometer at the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research (51).
The spectrometer was operated with a filtered fixed final neutron
energy of 13.7 meV [with horizontal collimation of 120′:50′:50′:120′
(32)], and the crystals were mounted in a furnace with the (HK0) re-
flections in the scattering plane using a vanadium holder (vanadium
was used because it scatters incoherently). Measurements were made
along [2, K, 0] at 21 equally spaced values of K between 0 and 0.5 at
temperatures above and below TC: 515 and 300 K for PMN-38%PT
(TC = 465 K). The PZN-5%PT crystal, also mounted in a vanadium
holder, was measured on the HB3 spectrometer at the High Flux Iso-
tope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HB3 spectrometer
was operated with a filtered fixed final neutron energy of 14.7 meV
(with horizontal collimation of 48′:60′:80′:120′), and measurements
were made with the same crystal orientation and at the same points
in reciprocal space as with BT7, again at temperatures above and below
TC: 500 and 300 K (TC = 425 K for PZN-5%PT). Both instruments used
pyrolytic graphite PG(002) for the monochromator and the analyzer.
Crystal growth and electric field poling
PMN-PT single-crystal boules were grown using a modified Bridgman
growth method. The boules were oriented for the major crystallographic
orientations [001]c, [011]c, and [111]c using Laue x-ray and x-ray dif-
fractometry. Sections of crystals 0.5 cm thick were sliced from the boule
using an ID (inner diameter) saw. The composition of the crystals was
first estimated from the positions in the crystal boules and then later con-
firmed by measuring the transition temperatures using high-temperature
x-ray diffraction on the individual crystals and comparing these to the
known phase diagrams. For the unpoled PMN-30%PT crystals, the slices
were used as cut.
For poling purposes, two slices (0.5 cm thick and ~5 cm in diameter)
were cleaned and metallized with chromium (~500-Å layer) and gold
(2000-Å layer) using a sputtering process (fig. S2). The metallized sec-
tion was then poled using a polarization bath. The crystal slice was
immersed in a bath of Fluorinert oil (silicone oil with high dielectric
strength), and a dc electric field was applied. For the rhombohedral
PMN-30%PT crystal, the crystal samples were poled by applying a dc
electric field of 4 kV/cm at room temperature. Piezoelectric charge co-
efficient (d33) was measured using a d33 meter to determine whether the
crystal slices were poled into a piezoelectric state. After poling, polariza-
tion changes (as a function of applied electric field) were observed on
batch qualification samples using a hysteresis loop device that works

based on the Sawyer-Tower circuit. This measurement uses an integra-
tor to determine the charge per unit area formed on the electrode sur-
face of a dielectric subjected to an electric field. The voltage is applied
in the form of a biased (unipolar) triangle wave (0 to peak) for a small
number of cycles (~3). The hysteresis area between the field-ascending
and the field-descending portions of the curve is proportional to the
energy lost as heat during a charge-discharge cycle, and this hysteresis
loop represents a behavior that is typical of ferroelectric materials.
