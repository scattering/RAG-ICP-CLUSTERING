Investigation of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra in Fe1+yTe1−xSex near a signature wave vector Q =
(1,0,0) for the bond-order wave (BOW) formation of parent compound Fe1+yTe [D. Fobes et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
112, 187202 (2014)] reveals an acoustic-phonon-like dispersion present in all structural phases. While a structural
Bragg peak accompanies the mode in the low-temperature phase of Fe1+yTe, it is absent in the high-temperature
tetragonal phase, where Bragg scattering at this Q is forbidden by symmetry. Notably, this mode is also observed
in superconducting FeTe0.55Se0.45, where structural and magnetic transitions are suppressed, and no BOW has
been observed. The presence of this “forbidden” phonon indicates that the lattice symmetry is dynamically or
locally broken by magneto-orbital BOW ﬂuctuations, which are strongly coupled to lattice in these materials.

Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity
(HTSC) in cuprates, elucidation of the connection between
the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom has been of
considerable interest in regard to the driving mechanisms
behind HTSC. The iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) share
many similarities with the cuprates; both have parent phases
featuring antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering, structural dis-
tortions, strong magnetic ﬂuctations, and broken electronic
symmetry [1–5]. Understanding the complex lattice dynamics
in FeSCs is of critical importance for understanding the
connection between these different orders, their relation to the
superconductivity, and the connection between the two types
of HTSCs. The compounds in the iron-chalcogenide series,
featuring the simplest structure and the strongest electronic
correlation among the Fe-HTSC, provide a good opportunity
to study these dynamics.
The iron-chalcogenides Fe1+yTe1+xSex, with a maximum
Tc of ∼14.5 K at optimal doping, consist of a continuous
stacking of Fe square-lattice layers, separated by two half-
ﬁlled chalcogen (Te,Se) layers [6–8]. Initially predicted by
band structure calculations to be a metal [9], the nonsupercon-
ducting parent material Fe1+yTe instead exhibits nonmetallic
character in resistivity, indicative of charge carrier incoherence
near the Fermi level at high temperatures [10–12]. Large
local magnetic moments of about 4 μB, which indicate
full involvement of three electronic bands, are revealed by
Curie-Weiss behavior in magnetic susceptibility [11–13];
nevertheless, angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) studies
show signiﬁcant spectral weight near the Fermi energy
[14–16].
These electronic and magnetic properties of Fe(Te,Se) are
very sensitive to nonstoichiometric Fe at interstitial sites,
particularly evident in the parent compound [17–24]; at
low concentrations, a ﬁrst-order magnetostructural transition
is observed from paramagnetic tetragonal (P4/nmm) to
*dfobes@bnl.gov
†zaliznyak@bnl.gov
monoclinic (P21/m) with bicollinear AFM order [propagation
vector q = (0.5,0,0.5)] and metallic resistivity [18–21]. For
intermediate 0.06 ≲y ≲0.12 the magnetostructural transition
splits into a sequence of transitions. Our recent neutron studies
of Fe1+yTe in the intermediate range uncovered evidence that
the lowest-temperature transition coincides with the formation
of a bond-order wave (BOW), indicative of ferro-orbital order
in the ground state [1], which stabilizes the bicollinear AFM
order in the low-T phase, common to y ≲0.12.
In this Rapid Communication, we report inelastic neutron
scattering measurements on Fe1+yTe1−xSex samples, aimed
at elucidating the dynamics associated with the BOW state.
We have studied two compositions of the Fe1+yTe parent
compound, as well as the optimally-doped superconductor
FeTe1−xSex (x = 0.45). In all three samples, we observe an
acoustic-phonon-like mode that appears to disperse out of the
Q = (1,0,0) reciprocal lattice point, even in the tetragonal
structure where such a Bragg peak is forbidden by crystal
symmetry; only a weak reﬂection, manifest of the BOW state,
develops at this wave vector in the parent compounds at low
T . At all temperatures, the mode appears to be ungapped and
sharp within instrumental resolution, demonstrating it is not
a conventional soft mode; furthermore, we have conﬁrmed
that it is not a result of magnetic spin-ﬂip scattering. The
presence of this phonon suggests a dynamical breaking of
crystal symmetry, potentially related to the magneto-orbital
BOW ﬂuctuations in these materials.
Neutron scattering measurements were carried out using
the hybrid spectrometer (HYSPEC) [25,26] at the Spallation
Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and polar-
ized neutron measurements were performed on the double
focusing triple-axis spectrometer (BT-7) [27] at the NIST
Center for Neutron Research and the polarized triple-axis
spectrometer (HB-1) at the high-ﬂux isotope reactor (HFIR)
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Ef = 14.7 meV). The
three following samples were investigated: Fe1.06Te, Fe1.1Te,
and FeTe0.55Se0.45. Fe1.06Te consists of two co-aligned single
crystals (mtotal ≈24 g) with a mosaic of 2.7◦full width at half
maximum (FWHM). Fe1.1Te is a single crystal (m = 18.45 g)

with a mosaic of 2.2◦FWHM. FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a single crystal
(m = 23.4 g) with a mosaic of 2.2◦FWHM. All samples were
grown by the horizontal Bridgman method [8], and mounted on
an aluminum holder. Measurements of scattering in the (h,k,0)
and the (h,0,l) plane were obtained by aligning crystals with
c-axis, or b-axis vertical, respectively.
In Fig. 1, we present inelastic neutron scattering intensity,
which reveals acoustic-phonon-like dispersions along (1,0,l),
as a function of energy transfer ℏω, for all three samples.
At 5 K the structure in the Fe1+yTe samples is monoclinic
(P21/m) [1], and acoustic phonons dispersing out of the (100)
and (101) Bragg peaks present at these positions would not
be unexpected [Figs. 1(a) and 1(c)]. However, at 300 K the
structure is tetragonal (P4/nmm) [18] and the (100) Bragg
reﬂection is symmetry forbidden; nevertheless, a gapless,
acoustic-phonon-like mode is still observed dispersing out of
the forbidden Bragg position [Figs. 1(b) and 1(d)]. A similar
mode is also observed in superconducting FeTe0.55Se0.45
throughout the whole temperature range [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f)].
In FeTe0.55Se0.45 the structural and magnetic transitions
observed in the parent compound are suppressed, and it
is therefore tetragonal at all temperatures, so that Bragg
scattering at (100) is never allowed. In [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f)],
residual elastic scattering appears to be present at (100), but
elastic slices (data not shown) reveal an unusual structure to
the (100) peak, which changes depending on the incident
energy, suggesting that these elastic features are a result of
multiple scattering, not uncommon in samples of this size. The
observed forbidden mode appears to be ungapped within the

mode [r.l.u. is in units of a∗= 1.645(5) ˚A

experimental limit, ≲1 meV, mainly imposed by the presence
of this spurious double scattering.
In Fig. 2 we show constant-energy inelastic data covering
a large region of the (h,k,0) plane for the Fe1.1Te and
FeTe0.55Se0.45 samples. The data reveal the presence of ringlike
contours of inelastic scattering intensity consistent with the
dispersion of excitations around the forbidden Bragg peaks
at the symmetry equivalent positions in different Brillouin
zones, (±2n ± 1,0,0), (0,−2n −1,0), n = 0,1,2. The line
cuts presented in [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)], reveal both the longi-
tudinal acoustic phonon branch near (±2n,0,0) and the small
“forbidden mode” peaks near (±2n + 1,0,0), whose intensity
distribution with respect to the wave vector direction is consis-
tent with that of a longitudinal acoustic phonon, as discussed
in more detail below. However, the forbidden peak position
reveals a dispersion with velocity, v = 21(1) meV/r.l.u. in
Fe1.1Te and v = 22(2) meV/r.l.u. in FeTe0.55Se0.45, which is
markedly (nearly twice) slower than the respective longitudinal
phonon velocities, vL ≈36(2) meV/r.l.u. and vL = 44(8)
meV/r.l.u., and is close to that of the transverse acoustic
modes. Hence, the combination of polarization and dispersion
of the forbidden mode is inconsistent with that expected
for a phonon in an ideal lattice. In addition, the forbidden
phonon intensities at symmetry equivalent positions do not
display the expected scaling with wave vector, ∼Q2; one

symmetry-equivalent positions, I/Q2, should be constant as a

In Fig. 3, we present a set of line cuts along (1,k,0) of
χ′′(Q,ℏω) in FeTe0.55Se0.45 at multiple energy transfers, 2 meV

j(q + τ) are the mode frequency and
polarization vectors, which are given by the eigenvalues and
the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix [29,30]. Due to lattice
periodicity, q can be constrained to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
In the long-wavelength limit of acoustic phonons, all
atoms in the unit cell move uniformly together, and the
magnitude of the phonon structure factor approaches that of
the static structure factor at the Bragg position τ from which
the dispersion originates, |gν

Q→τ (τ 2/M)|F(τ)|2 cos2 β,
where M is the sum of the atomic masses and β is the
angle that the phonon polarization makes with τ. Therefore,
in the situation where τ is a forbidden Bragg reﬂection,
|F(τ)| = 0 and acoustic phonon scattering is forbidden in this
approximation. Using a Taylor expansion in Q = τ + q near
τ, we obtain, |gν
Q|2 ≲αq2, where α is a constant. Thus, taking
account of the linear dispersion of an acoustic mode at small
q, the one-phonon scattering intensity converted to χ′′(Q,ω)
by adjusting for the thermal balance factor in Eq. (1), which is
proportional to |gν
Q|2/ων(q) ≲αq/v, should be decreasing to
zero, at most linearly in q, as q →0 and ℏω →0. This is in
contradiction to what is seen in Fig. 3(b), where the integrated
intensity of χ′′(Q,ω), increases as ℏω decreases. Analysis of
Fe1.1Te and Fe1.06Te data [Figs. 1(a)–1(d)] leads to similar
conclusions [28].
In order to understand the possible origin of the observed
“forbidden phonon” mode, we performed LDA frozen phonon
calculations, which reveal a coupling between atomic dis-
placements and magnetic moments of neighboring Fe atoms,
suggesting the possibility that a forbidden phonon mode could
result from magnetic scattering induced by thermal atomic
vibrations [28]. To test this, polarized neutron measurements
were performed on the Fe1.06Te sample, as shown in Fig. 4,
where spin-ﬂip (SF) and non-spin-ﬂip (NSF) scattering was
measured at 300 K and 2.5 K using 3He polarizers and Q ∥B
(guide ﬁeld). With a median ﬂipping ratio of ∼30 during
these experiments, our results indicate a lack of SF magnetic
scattering from either the expected (200) phonon or the “for-
bidden” (100) mode. A similar polarized neutron experiment
was performed on the FeTe0.55Se0.45 sample [28] at HB-1,
yielding consistent results. While the absence of spin-ﬂip
scattering indicates the mode primarily originates from atomic
displacements, this does not exclude a scenario in which

the atomic displacements originate from magnetic/orbital
ﬂuctuations, as we discuss below.
A previous example of a “forbidden” phonon was found in
Fe65Ni35 invar, in which a transverse acoustic (TA) mode is
observed in a position where it is forbidden by the scattering
geometry, i.e., Q · ξ(q) = 0, cf. Eqs. (1) and (2) [31]. An
early explanation suggested this mode could result from the
breaking of the cubic crystal symmetry of the dynamical
matrix by slow local orthorhombic distortions [32]. This mode
has several properties divergent from those expected for a
conventional phonon. The mode does not exhibit the expected
Q2 dependence, but instead shows a decrease in intensity
at higher Q. The mode also shows a signiﬁcant decrease
in intensity at temperatures above the magnetic ordering
temperature (Tc ≈550 K). Finally, some contribution to the
scattering intensity is structural and some is magnetic [33].
These results suggested that this mode is in part a result
of magnetic ﬂuctuations, where the strong coupling of the
magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom also results in
magnetically-driven lattice vibration.
The magnetic ﬂuctuations in the iron chalcogenides are well
known to be strong, even in the absence of long-range magnetic
order in these materials [34,35], and previous studies have
emphasized the strong coupling between the electronic spin,
orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom [1]. The location of the
“forbidden” phonon, which we observe near the wave vector
of BOW ferro-orbital ordering in the parent FeTe material [1]
clearly suggests involvement of the orbital degrees of freedom.
This is consistent with the magnetovibrational scenario set
forth by our LDA frozen phonon calculation, similar to that
offered to explain the “forbidden” phonon in Fe-Ni invar,
but with an additional factor of the orbital hybridization, a
crucial ingredient. Speciﬁcally, BOW-type ﬂuctuations of the
magneto-orbital nature associated with the dynamical spin
imbalance between neighboring Fe atoms might lead to atomic
displacements corresponding to the vibrations of forbidden
character [28].
Recently, another example of a “forbidden” phonon has
been observed in La2−xBaxCuO4 (x = 0.125), where the mode
has been attributed to CuO6 octahedral tilt ﬂuctuations [36].
A possible electronic coupling for the observed mode is not
ruled out. It could be that an acoustic phonon-like mode near
a structurally forbidden Bragg reﬂection is a universal feature
indicative of coupling between electronic and lattice degrees
of freedom in both cuprates and iron chalcogenides.
In summary, we have observed an acoustic phononlike
mode dispersing from a position where Bragg scattering is
forbidden by crystal symmetry in both the nonsuperconducting
end-member and optimally-doped superconducting member
of the iron-chalcogenide family. The mode intensity does
not follow the expected behavior for phonon scattering.
Frozen phonon LDA calculations suggest that this mode might
originate from slow, BOW-type electronic magneto-orbital
ﬂuctuations associated with Fe magnetic moments, which lead
to a dynamical breaking of the crystal unit cell symmetry.
