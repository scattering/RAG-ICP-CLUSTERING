We use neutron scattering to compare the magnetic excitations in the hidden order (HO) and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) phases in URu2−xFexSi2 as a function of Fe concentration. The magnetic excitation spectra change
signiﬁcantly between x = 0.05 and x = 0.10, following the enhancement of the AFM ordered moment, in
good analogy to the behavior of the parent compound under applied pressure. Prominent lattice-commensurate
low-energy excitations characteristic of the HO phase vanish in the AFM phase. The magnetic scattering is
dominated by strong excitations along the Brillouin zone edges, underscoring the important role of electron
hybridization to both HO and AFM phases and the similarity of the underlying electronic structure. The stability
of the AFM phase is correlated with enhanced local-itinerant electron hybridization.

The nature of the hidden order (HO) phase of URu2Si2 is a
longstanding challenge for condensed matter physics [1]. The
phase transition is characterized by a large entropy change
at 17.5 K along with features in electrical resistivity and
magnetic susceptibility [2–4]. Along with multiple studies
that show a gap opening in the charge [5–8] and spin [9–11]
excitation spectra, these properties indicate that the HO phase
involves a rearrangement of the high-temperature correlated
electronic state composed of interacting itinerant and localized
f electrons. Nonetheless, identiﬁcation of the static order
parameter in the HO phase remains elusive, and even a
proper description of the f -electron state on uranium is
controversial [12–14].
The unusual spin excitation spectrum of URu2Si2 offers
some clues to the underlying interactions in both the correlated
paramagnetic and HO phases. The most prominent, and most
studied, features are excitations at the Brillouin zone (BZ) face
center Z and at an incommensurate point , which sits on a
BZ edge [9–11] [see Fig. 1(a)]. The latter resonance actually
represents part of a ring of excitations that approximately
follows the BZ edge, which can be attributed to interband
transitions of the correlated electron bands [15]. Although
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order has been excluded [16–18],
the presence of a sharp magnetic excitation at Z, which is the
reconstructed BZ center of the simplest AFM order, suggests
that the HO phase may break spatial symmetry [19,20].
True AFM order is stabilized by applied pressure [21,22],
and measurements at the Z and  points show that the

magnetic excitation energies change discontinuously in the
AFM phase [23,24]; in particular, the Z excitation gap
appears to close. However, the momentum dependence of these
excitations remains unknown.
Fortunately, Fe substitution appears to mimic the effects of
applied pressure by stabilizing the AFM order [25]. Neutron
diffraction measurements suggest that the phase diagrams
are analogous at low Fe concentration and low applied
pressure, albeit with a larger moment in the Fe case [26].
Thermal expansion measurements on URu1.9Fe0.1Si2 demon-
strate that the HO-AFM phase boundary passes through this
concentration [27], similar to what was seen in URu2Si2
under pressure [23]. Optical conductivity [28] and muon spin
rotation [29] measurements also support the existence of an
AFM phase, but there are some disagreements about the exact
location of the HO-AFM phase boundary.
To probe the momentum dependence of the magnetic
excitation spectrum in the AFM phase, we performed in-
elastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of
URu2−xFexSi2 in both the HO and AFM phases. We ﬁnd that
Fe substitution broadens and slightly suppresses the dispersive
excitations at Z, and that they vanish in the AFM phase,
where they are replaced by a 5 meV gap. The phase boundary
separating HO from AFM is located between x = 0.05 and
x = 0.10. The lack of conventional spin waves in the AFM
phase calls into question the use of Z-point excitations as
proof of zone folding in the HO phase. In contrast, the
incommensurate excitations at  and around the zone edge
remain, although the energy gap increases to 8 meV. The same
hybridized interband correlations serve as a background to
both HO and AFM phases, and both order parameters gap
the spin ﬂuctuation spectrum similarly, suggesting similar
electronic structures. The AFM phase is stabilized by increased
electron hybridization.
Single crystals of URu2−xFexSi2 were synthesized via the
Czochralski technique in a continuously gettered tetra-arc

FIG. 1. Composition dependence of the ground-state magnetic
excitations in the HO and AFM phases. (a) The phase diagram shows
the transition temperatures for four different Fe concentrations: x =
0.025 (black squares), 0.05 (red diamonds), 0.1 (blue circles), and
0.2 (green triangles). The reciprocal space map highlights important
directions. Strong low-energy magnetic ﬂuctuations are suppressed in
the AFM phase, as seen at (b) the Z point, or antiferromagnetic zone
center; (c) the  point on the zone edge, where some spectral weight
has shifted to higher energy; and (d) the X point on the diagonal edge.
The inelastic spectra for x = 0.1 and 0.2 nearly overlap. Shapes and
colors of data points correspond to x values from (a). Lines represent
ﬁts described in the text. Data were collected on BT-7 at 2.5 K.
furnace, without subsequent annealing. Agreement between
nominal and actual x values is inferred from the concurrence
between lattice constants, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and
bulk properties of single crystal [27,30] and arc-melted poly-
crystalline samples [25]. Neutron scattering measurements on
samples with nominal x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 (respective
masses 6.2, 4.5, 1.2, and 1.5 g) were carried out at the NIST
Center for Neutron Research on the BT-7 thermal triple axis
spectrometer [31] with 14.7 meV ﬁnal energy, the NG-5
cold triple axis spectrometer with 3.7 meV ﬁnal energy, and
the NG-4 disk-chopper spectrometer [32]. Data analysis was
performed using the DAVE software suite [33]. Throughout
this paper, error bars associated with measurements and ﬁts
correspond to one standard deviation.
The body-centered tetragonal (BCT) lattice of URu2Si2
has a BZ with high-symmetry points of importance to the
magnetic excitations: BZ center , horizontal face center X,
vertical face center Z, and horizontal edge center . The
Z point also represents the AFM zone center, and becomes
equivalent to  when the lattice symmetry is reduced to
simple tetragonal in the AFM phase, and perhaps in the HO
phase. Neutron diffraction shows that the Fe-stabilized AFM
magnetic structure is equivalent to that in URu2Si2 under
pressure [21].
The effects of Fe substitution on the magnetic excitations
at the Z, , and X points clearly delineate the HO and AFM
phases. Figure 1(a) shows the magnetic phase diagram of
URu2−xFexSi2 and the transition temperatures of the studied
samples. The x dependence of the magnetic excitations in
the ground state is depicted via scans at constant momentum
Q and varying energy E at the Z [Fig. 1(b)],  [Fig. 1(c)],
and X [Fig. 1(d)] points. The magnetic scattering intensity
S(Q,E) has been normalized to absolute units by subtraction
of the fast neutron background and comparison to phonon
scattering [34] assuming a uranium magnetic form factor [15].
Within reasonable uncertainty in these normalized data, the
intensity of the paramagnetic ﬂuctuations at temperature T =
25 K at  is x independent, and resembles the scattering in
URu2Si2 [15]. This serves as the basis for a subsequent ﬁne-
tuning normalization; we estimate a 40% absolute uncertainty
in the reported value. Converting to the dynamic susceptibility
χ′′(Q,E) = (1 −e−
E
kB T )S(Q,E) corrects for the T -dependent
increase in scattering at small E < kBT , where kB is the
Boltzmann constant.
The characteristic sharply peaked excitations of the HO
phase are weakened in the AFM phase. Most striking is the
Z point, where the prominent excitation is replaced by a gap
in the magnetic excitation spectrum. The E dependence of
the inelastic scattering can be phenomenologically described
by a step function with x-dependent inﬂection point, and a
Lorentzian function centered at low energy. The Lorentzian
is present only in the HO phase, whereas the step function
persists into the AFM phase. The abrupt change in the magnetic
excitation spectrum between x = 0.05 and x = 0.10 places
the phase boundary in between those concentrations. At 
[Fig. 1(c)], the broad Lorentzian persists into the AFM phase,
although it shifts upward in E. Here also, a sigmoid plus
Lorentzian form is convenient to describe the asymmetric
line shape. At X, the excitations vanish in the measured E
range, apparently shifting to higher E outside the measurement
window. No prominent low-E excitations have been detected
in cold neutron measurements, and a 0.15 μ2
B/meV upper
bound is estimated for any excitations below 1.5 meV. Neutron
measurements were not sensitive to the two transitions in
x = 0.1 that were observed in thermal expansion [27]. The
slight shifts in E at low x at  and Z mimic the effects of
applied pressure in URu2Si2 [24].
The temperature dependence of the magnetic excitations
follows the onset of the ordered phase as determined by
neutron diffraction and thermodynamic measurements [26].
This is shown in Fig. 2: in the HO phase, at both  and
Z, the excitation spectrum changes from weak, low-energy
excitations in the correlated paramagnetic state to higher
energy excitations in the HO and AFM phases, with an
energy gap comparable to that observed in URu2Si2. In the
AFM phase, the intensity of the excitations is weaker and
the peak energies are higher. At both  and Z, the gap
value can be roughly deﬁned as the inﬂection point in the
E dependence of the intensity, with a value of 7–8 meV (see
also Fig. 1). These values are consistent with the published
pressure dependence in URu2Si2 [23,24], but these values
are larger than those determined from optical conductivity
measurements on Fe-substituted samples [28].
The detailed momentum dependence of the magnetic
excitations in the AFM phase is shown in Fig. 3. The
oft-studied magnetic dispersions along the (100) direction
and its symmetry equivalents are presented in Fig. 3(a). The
most prominent excitations are centered at the BCT zone

FIG. 2. Temperature dependence of the magnetic excitations in
the HO and AFM phases. At both the zone edge  (a)–(d) and AFM
zone center Z (e)–(h), broad magnetic ﬂuctuations shift to higher
energy below the respective ordering temperatures. The change in the
magnetic excitations is abrupt as a function of temperature in all cases.
In the AFM phase in x = 0.2, the magnetic excitation intensity at Z is
reduced overall, but a temperature-dependent magnetic gap remains
a telltale feature. Data were collected on BT-7, and the low-energy
data in (h) on NG-5.

in URu2Si2, these excitations disperse steeply upward toward

FIG. 3. Momentum dependence of the magnetic excitations in
the AFM phase for x = 0.2. (a) In the ground state, along the (100)
direction, from Z to , the most prominent excitations are at the zone
edge at  where the gap is smallest, as is the case in the HO phase.
Also along the (110) direction, from Z to X, the gap minimum and
strongest magnetic intensity occur near the zone edge. (b) Along the
(100) direction in the paramagnetic phase, the energy gap decreases
signiﬁcantly, but the intensity is still maximum at . Data were
collected on BT-7.

conclusively deﬁne due to the weakness of the excitations.
The Z-X direction is qualitatively similar, with a dispersion
minimum at q ≈0.35, as in the parent compound. Thus it
is apparent that the AFM and HO phases have in common a
ring of strong magnetic excitations that traces the BCT zone
edge. The high-temperature ﬂuctuations of this ring are also
analogous, as shown in Fig. 3(b). At 25 K in the correlated
paramagnetic phase, the excitations are broad and at lower E
but remain centered on Z and . The momentum dependence
of the ring in the AFM phase is remarkably similar to that in the
HO phase in URu2Si2, as summarized in Fig. 4, emphasizing
that the excitations traverse the zone edge in the same manner
as in the parent compound [15], although the E-integrated
ﬂuctuating moment is reduced by a factor of
√
2.
These results underscore the interpretation of the incom-
mensurate excitations as those due to interband scattering
in URu2Si2 [15]. This description is consistent with the x
dependence of the speciﬁc heat, magnetization, and electrical
resistivity, which remain similar in this range of Fe concen-
tration [25], meaning that the correlated electron state and the
details of its band structure do not change dramatically. Within
the context of an interband hopping model [15], the implication
is that a small electron pocket remains at  and a large hole
pocket remains centered on Z. The difference in resonance
energy between x = 0 and x = 0.2 signiﬁes a 4 meV increase
in the indirect hybridization gap that appears to be tied to the
change from the HO to the AFM phase. Because the momen-
tum dependence of the interband transitions remains the same,
without invoking changes in the uncorrelated band structure,
the gap increase can be simply related to an increase in the
local-itinerant hybridization potential, which may be naturally
expected in the context of shrinking interatomic spacing due
to chemical pressure [25]. This enhanced hybridization may
represent a crucial component of what determines the relative
stability of the HO and AFM phases.

There are also other apparent changes in the band structure.
The obvious lack of prominent, sharply dispersing excitations
at Z distinguishes the AFM phase from HO. If the electronic
structures in the Fe-tuned AFM and HO phases are similar as
they are under pressure [35], then the absence of prominent
excitations cannot be due to the absence of the small hole-like
band at Z in the AFM phase. If the weak excitations at Z
also stem from interband transitions, then the hybridization
gap at Z has also increased by 4 meV, meaning that the
hybridization of different bands has been affected similarly. In
the HO phase, magnetic excitations disperse near the X point,
albeit weakly [15]. In the AFM phase, on the other hand,
these excitations are not observed [Fig. 1(d)]. It is possible
that they are also pushed to higher E, where broadening
and the presence of phonons make identiﬁcation difﬁcult,
but a compelling alternative is that these excitations vanish
in the AFM phase, yielding another clue to the stability
of the HO phase. Indeed, the X point was identiﬁed in
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies
as being near possible nesting or hot-spot wave vectors [36,37].
It is therefore a priority to conﬁrm the hybridization gap
increase and the inferred band structure in URu1.8Fe0.2Si2 via
ARPES and quantum oscillation measurements.
Another important feature of the AFM magnetic excitations
is the absence of strong low-E spin waves near Z. This
contrasts with the readily apparent Z-centered excitations in
the HO phase, which have been interpreted as evidence that
the HO phase breaks spatial symmetry in a manner similar
to the AFM phase, most recently in the context of Raman
scattering [19,20]. The absence of similar excitations in the
AFM phase implies that the Z-centered magnetic excitations
in the HO phase are not a sure signature of BCT symmetry
breaking in the HO phase. A more conventional interpretation
of the data is that the Z-centered interband transitions are
actually the AFM spin waves [Figs. 2(d) and 3(a)], but this
is not straightforward either; it contradicts the trend in peak
energy observed in the HO phase [Fig. 1(b)] and under
pressure [24], and yields an excitation energy scale that is
several times greater than the transition temperature of 20 K,
whereas the HO phase is more conventional in this regard.
Either way, the AFM phase has an unconventional character
and is interesting in its own right.
It should be noted that even in the HO phase, the Z-centered
excitations make up a negligible fraction of the total ﬂuctuating
moment when compared to the much stronger incommensurate
excitations that occupy a much larger fraction of reciprocal
space. Their presence or absence would affect the bulk
physical properties of the HO and AFM phases only subtly,
as experiment shows [38,39]. This highlights the fact that
the AFM phase is in many ways just as subtle as the HO
itself, and it is advantageous that the AFM order parameter is
already known. Developing a proper theoretical understanding
of the weak AFM excitations should be more tractable than
identifying HO directly, and may provide an alternate route to
understanding the complicated electron interactions at the root
of both phenomena.
Our measurements strongly support the analogy between
the Fe-substituted and pressure-tuned phase diagrams, ex-
tending the experimental possibilities for studying the AFM
phase, which otherwise remains technically challenging in
the parent compound due to the constraints inherent in
pressure cells. In addition to measurements sensitive to
band structure, it will be interesting to compare the AFM
properties in high magnetic ﬁelds, and the detailed char-
acteristics of the low-temperature superconductivity. The
speciﬁcs of the AFM magnetic excitation spectrum will
also provide useful constraints for theoretical descriptions
of the AFM phase, as well as the HO phase that it
borders.
Finally, we note recent developments. Our inelastic spectra
are consistent with those of Willams and coworkers [40]. A
different study by Willams and coworkers of the pressure-
induced AFM phase in URu2Si2, concludes that the inelastic
excitations near Z remain at ﬁnite energy [41], in contrast to
prior reports that these excitations decrease to zero energy or
disappear [23,24], raising a question about whether pressure
and Fe substitution induce similar AFM behavior. The Raman
signal reported by Kung et al. [42] as a function of Fe
substitution reappears in the AFM phase. This has been
identiﬁed with the magnetic excitation at Z; but in our neutron
data, there are no prominent low-energy excitations at Z in the
AFM phase.
