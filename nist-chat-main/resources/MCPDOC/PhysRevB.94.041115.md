We report the hydrostatic pressure-induced electronic and magnetic phase transitions in a Mott insulator,
a bilayer ruthenate Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7, via electronic transport and single crystal neutron diffraction
measurements. The system undergoes an insulator-metal transition at a very small hydrostatic pressureࣈ0.04 GPa,
followed by a magnetic phase transition around 0.3 GPa, suggesting that the low energy charge ﬂuctuation and
magnetic ordering couple to the pressure separately in this compound. The ab initio calculations show that
the suppressed RuO6 ﬂattening induced by the pressure reduces the orbital polarization and gives rise to an
insulator-metal transition preceding the magnetic phase transition.

Understanding metal-insulator transitions (MITs) in Mott
systems arising from strong electron-electron interaction (U)
remains a major challenge [1]. Tuning the MIT by means
of pressure has been one of the major methods used to
understand the electronic correlation effect when one assumes
an enhanced electronic bandwidth by pressure without change
in other physical parameters. However, the strong interplay
among various degrees of freedom of lattice, spin, charge, and
orbital in many (magnetic) Mott systems often leads to simul-
taneous variations in crystal structure, magnetism, and electron
orbital occupancy, which brings about the complexity in
understanding the pressure-induced insulator-metal transition
(IMT) [2]. For instance, an application of pressure may alter
the transition-metal oxygen octahedral distortion (rotation, tilt,
and/or ﬂattening), which can subsequently affect the magnetic
exchange interactions and/or the electronic conﬁgurations.
Ruthenates with Ruddlesden-Popper-type layered struc-
ture, (Sr1−xCax)n+1RunO3n+1, have been attracting intense
attention in the past two decades owing to a wealth of collective
correlated electron phenomena [3]. For instance, in single-
layered ruthenate with n = 1, tetragonal Sr2RuO4 shows
spin-triplet superconductivity [4–6], whereas orthorhombic
Ca2RuO4 is an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator with
its MIT temperature TMIT ∼360 K being well above the N´eel
temperature TN ∼115 K [7,8]. The orthorhombic distortion
in Ca2RuO4 originates from RuO6 octahedral rotation, tilting,
and ﬂattening, and its MIT mechanism has been a topic of long
debate [9–13]. Another distinct characteristic of ruthenates is
that their electronic and magnetic properties vary dramatically
as the number of RuO layers n increases. This is exempliﬁed by
the signiﬁcant property change from Ca2RuO4 to Ca3Ru2O7.

Unlike Ca2RuO4, which shows a G-type AFM order, the
bilayer Ca3Ru2O7 (n = 2) orders antiferromagnetically at
TN ∼56 K [14] with ferromagnetic (FM) bilayers stacked in
antiparallel alignment along the c axis (with the spin easy axis
along the a axis, denoted as AFM-a) [15–17]. This is followed
by a MIT with a small increase in resistivity at TMIT ∼48 K
[14], as well as a switching of spins to the b axis (denoted
as AFM-b) [17], and then by the reappearance of metallicity
below 30 K [18] originating from the existence of a small
portion of unnested Fermi surface pockets [19].
Recently, we have shown that partially replacing Ru with
(⩾3%) Ti can also induce a dramatic change of the ground state
properties [20,21]: The material turns into a Mott insulator
concurrently with a large structural change and a magnetic
transition from AFM-a to G-AFM order, with the nearest-
neighbor spins aligned antiferromagnetically both in plane and
along the c axis [Fig. 1(b)]. In the insulating state, the electronic
bandwidth of the Ti-substituted compounds becomes narrower
compared to that of the pristine compound due to the disruption
of carrier hopping by Ti dopants [20]; this was conﬁrmed
later by photoemission measurements [22]. Interestingly, we
found that the 3% Ti-doped compound, Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7,
resides right at the phase boundary [21]: (i) There is only
one single phase transition for Ca3(Ru1−xTix)2 O7 (x > 3%)
with a G-AFM Mott insulating ground state, while for
Ca3(Ru1−xTix)2 O7 (x < 3%), there are two phase transitions,
with the ground state exhibiting a localized electronic state
and an AFM-b type magnetic structure [Fig. 1(b)]. (ii)
At TMIT(∼46 K) < T < TN (∼62 K), Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7
shows a metallic behavior with a magnetic structure similar
to that in the pure compound (AFM-a), while it enters a
G-AFM Mott insulating state for T < TMIT. This suggests
that the ground state properties of Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7 can
be sensitive to subtle nonthermal perturbations (i.e., magnetic

of various of degrees of freedom.
In this Rapid Communication, we report the pressure-
induced
phase
transitions
in
the
bilayer
ruthenate
Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7 via electronic transport and single crystal
neutron diffraction measurements. We show that the electronic
structure of this system is extremely sensitive to hydrostatic
pressure, and an IMT takes place with a very small critical
pressure preceding the magnetic phase transition. The decou-
pling of the IMT and magnetic phase transition with pressure
can be attributed to the pressure-induced weakening of oxygen
octahedral ﬂattening, which modiﬁes the orbital occupancy
and leads to the electronic phase transition.
Figure 1(a) summarizes the temperature (T )–pressure (P)
phase diagram of Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7 established in this
Rapid Communication. The associated magnetic structures of
various phases denoted in the phase diagram are illustrated
in Fig. 1(b). Detailed information on the sample growth
and experimental measurements has been discussed in the
Supplemental Material [23]. There are two main features worth
emphasizing. First, the electronic structure and the magnetic
order couple separately to pressure at low temperature. The
system undergoes an IMT with a small critical pressure
Pc ∼0.04 GPa, which is followed by the magnetic phase
transition from G-AFM to AFM-b with further increasing

pressure (∼0.3 GPa). Second, right below the metallic AFM-a
phase at higher temperature, there exists a pressure-induced
intermediate magnetic phase with a coexistence of incommen-
surate (ICM) AFM and AFM-a (or AFM-b) ordering.
The complex T -P phase diagram was established via
comprehensive electronic transport measurements over a wide
range of T and P in conjunction with neutron diffraction
measurements. Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence
of resistivity measured along the c axis, ρc, with various ap-
plied hydrostatic pressures. At atmospheric pressure (i.e., P =
1 bar = 10−4 GPa), ρc increases sharply by approximately 6
orders of magnitude at TMIT ≈46 K, indicating a transition
to a Mott insulating state [20]. In the presence of hydrostatic
pressure, interestingly, ρc is dramatically suppressed even with
a small pressure. Similarly, the in-plane resistivity ρab also
signiﬁcantly decreases upon applying pressure, as shown in
the inset of Fig. 2(b). The main panel of Fig. 2(b) presents ρc
as a function of P measured at T = 20 K. One can see that
ρc drops dramatically and almost saturates above a critical
pressure Pc ≈0.04 GPa, suggesting a pressure-induced col-
lapse of the Mott insulating state. Above Pc, both ρc and ρab
exhibit a localized behavior below TMIT, which is in contrast
to the quasi-two-dimensional metallic state in the pristine
compound. This transport feature is similar to those measured
at ambient pressure on Ca3(Ru1−xTix)2 O7 (x < 3%) [21] and
Ca3(Ru0.95Fe0.05)2 O7 [24], and it is presumably attributed
to disorder scattering upon the transition-metal substitution
into Ru sites, which destroys the original weakly coherent
electronic state arising from the existence of small, nonnested
Fermi surface pockets [19]. It is worth noting that the value of
Pc for the IMT in Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7 in this study is much
lower than those of other Mott insulators studied thus far. For
instance, the critical pressure required to suppress the Mott
insulating state is 0.5 GPa for Ca2RuO4 [25] and ∼32 GPa
for LaMnO3 [26,27]. This indicates an anomalously high
sensitivity of the electronic state in Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7 to
the pressure, which unambiguously testiﬁes to the remarkable
sensitivity of the ground state of this material.

ambient pressure, respectively. The neutron counting time for each

map measured at P = 0.85 GPa showing the occurrence of an ICM

To probe the interplay among various degrees of freedom,
we also performed single crystal neutron diffraction measure-
ments to explore the pressure effect on both the magnetic and
crystal structures of Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7. Figures 3(a) and
3(b) shows the rocking curves of (0 0 5) and (1 0 2) magnetic
Bragg peaks measured on the HB3A diffractometer in the
High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) at T = 4 K with P = 10−4 GPa and 0.85
GPa. A CuBe clamp cell with Fluorinert (FC-70) as the
pressure medium was used (see Supplemental Material [23]).
Note that the (0 0 5) Bragg peak refers to the AFM-b or AFM-a
type magnetic structures in Ca3Ru2O7 [17], while (1 0 2) refers
to the G-AFM magnetic structure in the Ti-doped Ca3Ru2O7
[20]. Compared with the zero pressure data, surprisingly, we
ﬁnd that at P = 0.85 GPa, the (1 0 2) Bragg peak disappears
[Fig. 3(b)] while the (0 0 5) Bragg peak emerges [Fig. 3(a)],
which indicates a magnetic phase transition from the G-AFM
to the AFM-b type order (see Supplemental Material [23]).
The temperature dependence of the magnetic Bragg peaks,
(0 0 5) and (1 0 2), is plotted in Fig. 3(c). At P = 10−4 GPa,
the (0 0 5) Bragg peak appears at TN = 62 K, corresponding
to the AFM-a order, followed by its disappearance and an
emergence of the (1 0 2) Bragg peak below TMIT = 46 K
associated with the G-AFM order, which is consistent with the
previous study [20]. In contrast, at P = 0.85 GPa, the intensity
of the (1 0 2) Bragg peak is completely suppressed for the
whole measured temperature range; instead, the (0 0 5) Bragg
peak emerges below TMIT ≈38 K, conﬁrming the pressure-
induced magnetic phase transition. In comparison with the
zero pressure case, the change of magnetic structure correlates

with the much smaller enhancement in resistivity observed
below TMIT shown in Fig. 2(a) and the inset of Fig. 2(b). Note
that both TMIT and TN decrease in the presence of pressure.
Furthermore, one can see that at 31 K < T < 38 K, there is a
V-shaped drop in intensity of the pressure-induced (0 0 5)
Bragg peak, indicating an additional magnetic phase in-
duced by the applied pressure. This is corroborated by an
intermediate region between T ∗and TMIT in the transport
measurements [Fig. 2(c)], where T ∗marks the kink points
in the resistivity curves. We ﬁnd that in this region, the system
displays a coexistence of commensurate AFM-a (or AFM-b)
and ICM magnetic phases, which are represented by the
(0 0 5) and (H 05) (H ≈±0.022) peaks, respectively, as
shown in Fig. 3(d) (also see Supplemental Material [23]).
To further explore the evolution of the magnetic structure
as a function pressure, especially in the low pressure region,
we performed neutron diffraction measurements using a He
gas pressure cell on the BT7 triple-axis spectrometer at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center
for Neutron Research (NCNR) to gain better pressure control
(see Supplemental Material [23]). Figure 4(a) shows scans of
(1 0 2) and (0 0 5) magnetic Bragg peaks at lower pressure
values. Interestingly, one can see that G-AFM order persists for
pressure up to 0.2 GPa, at which point the electronic structure
transition (i.e., IMT) already occurs (Fig. 2). The magnetic
structure transforms to the AFM-b type for P > 0.3 GPa.
This suggests that the electronic structure and magnetic order
couple separately with pressure, with the magnetic phase
transition preceded by the IMT upon application of pressure.
Such a feature is in sharp contrast to the case when varying
temperature [20].
The hydrostatic pressure effect on the physical properties
of Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7 is summarized in the T -P phase
diagram presented in Fig. 1. It is known that, due to the
extended nature of the 4d orbital of Ru4+ ions, the magnetic
and electronic properties of ruthenates are very sensitive
to structural distortion (i.e., octahedral rotation, tilt, and/or
ﬂattening), which leads to a variation of the t2g orbital
degeneracy. For instance, an enhanced ﬂattening of RuO6
octahedra along the c axis is anticipated to lift the degeneracy
of three t2g bands, with the dxy orbital more energetically
favorable, resulting in an AFM insulating state [28]. Generally,
the octahedral distortion can be efﬁciently altered by either
internal pressure via chemical substitution or external pressure,
as elucidated in (Sr1−xCax)2 RuO4 [25,29–32]. Thus, it is

appealing to investigate the response of the crystal structure
to pressure and its interplay with the magnetic and electronic
properties in Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7.
Figure 4(c) shows the nonmonotonic dependence of lattice
parameter c on pressure. c increase ﬁrst with pressure and
reaches a maximum at a pressure of ∼0.3 GPa, which is much
larger than Pc for the IMT but is close to the value where there
is a magnetic phase transition from G-AFM to AFM-b. This
implies a pressure-induced anisotropic structural distortion
(instead of regular lattice contraction), a feature similar to
what was observed in Ca2RuO4 [29]. With further increase of
pressure, c decreases as a result of normal compression.
To further understand the mechanism of the pressure-
induced magnetic and electronic properties, we performed
ﬁrst-principles calculations using the local density approxi-
mation (LDA) + U method with a moderate U of 2 eV [33].
The irreducible Brillouin zone was sampled with 100 k-points.
Since the Ti-induced change in electron count is expected
to be very small, the calculations were done for the parent
Ca3Ru2O7. Figure 5(a) shows the projected density of states
(PDOS) of Ru t2g bands (dxy and dxz/dyz) calculated for the
G-AFM state using the experimental structure determined at
T = 4 K in the absence of external pressure. In contrast to
the metallic phase obtained previously without taking into
account U [20], an electronic gap of ∼0.2 eV develops for all
t2g bands, afﬁrming the important role of electron correlation
in this system. Interestingly, one can see that in the spin-down
channel, the xy orbital is almost fully occupied, while the
xz/yz orbitals are nearly empty, which suggests an electronic
conﬁguration of xy(↑↓) xz/yz (↑,↑) bands for the G-AFM
insulating phase [34]. Such orbital polarization is ascribed to
the ﬂattening of RuO6 octahedra, which causes the xy orbital to
be shifted downward. In Ca2RuO4, similar orbital polarization
has been observed [10,12]. The ﬂattening of RuO6 can be
roughly described by d1/d2, where d1(d2) is the Ru-O bond
length along the c axis (in-plane) direction [inset of Fig. 5(b)].
Without external pressure, the extracted d1/d2 is ∼0.985 for
the G-AFM phase.
In order to qualitatively capture the pressure-induced
metallic state with G-AFM spin structure, we calculated the
band structure with various ratios of d1/d2 but keeping the
magnetic order the same. Note that under nonzero pressure,
since the detailed atomic parameters are unknown, d1/d2
values are changed by assuming constant crystal volume
with an increase (decrease) in c (b) as reported previously in
the temperature dependent study [20]. Thus, d1/d2 increases
with P for P ⩽0.3 GPa as a result of the suppression of
RuO6 octahedral ﬂattening [Fig. 4(c)]. Figure 5(b) presents
the calculated band gap as a function of d1/d2. As d1/d2
increases, the band gap decreases and vanishes for larger d1/d2,
indicating an IMT, which is consistent with our experimental
results. The PDOS of the pressure-induced metallic state for
d1/d2 = 1.02 is shown in Fig. 5(c). It is seen that under
higher pressure, the occupancy of the xy orbital in the
spin-down channel is largely decreased, indicating the absence
of orbital polarization. Future experimental studies to examine
the orbital conﬁguration of this system are warranted.
In conclusion, we have reported the hydrostatic pressure-
induced
electronic
and
magnetic
phase
transitions
in
Ca3(Ru0.97Ti0.03)2O7. We ﬁnd that the electronic structure
and magnetic order of this material are highly sensitive and
couple separately to pressure, which is evidenced by the
occurrence of an IMT followed by a change of magnetic
structure as the pressure increases. First-principles calculations
show that the pressure-induced suppression of the ﬂattening
of the RuO6 octahedra reduces the orbital polarization and
leads to the IMT without changing the magnetic structure.
This Rapid Communication highlights the magnetic and
electronic instabilities of the ground state of this system and
the signiﬁcance of strong interplay among various degrees of
freedom in controlling materials properties.
