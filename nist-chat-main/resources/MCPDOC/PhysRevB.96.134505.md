We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of low-energy (¯hω ≲10 meV) magnetic excitations in
the “11” system Fe1+yTe1−xSex. The spin correlations are two-dimensional (2D) in the superconducting samples
at low temperature, but appear much more three-dimensional (3D) when the temperature rises well above
Tc ∼15 K, with a clear increase of the (dynamic) spin correlation length perpendicular to the Fe planes. This
behavior is extremely unusual; typically, the suppression of thermal ﬂuctuations at low temperature would favor
the enhancement of 3D correlations, or even ordering, and the reversion to 2D cannot be naturally explained when
only the spin degree of freedom is considered. Our results suggest that the low temperature physics in the 11
system, in particular the evolution of low-energy spin excitations towards superconducting pairing, intrinsically
involves changes in orbital correlations.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.96.134505
Fe-based superconductors [1–4] (FBS) share many similar-
ities with the high-Tc cuprate family, one of which being that, in
general, both systems have parent compounds with long-range
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. When the AFM order is
gradually suppressed by doping, superconductivity emerges.
The surviving magnetic excitations are widely believed to
play vital roles in mediating electron pairing required for
superconductivity [5,6]. While the magnetic order in the parent
compounds of both FBS and high-Tc cuprates are always
three-dimensional (3D), magnetic excitations in their super-
conducting (SC) derivatives are, however, in general more
two-dimensional (2D) in character [7–10]. The spin excitations
depend only weakly on momentum transfer perpendicular
to the Fe/Cu planes. The interplanar spin correlations are
signiﬁcantly weaker than the in-plane correlations, suggesting
the importance of reduced dimensionality for the pairing
mechanism in these unconventional superconductors.
On the other hand, unlike high-Tc cuprates where only
the Cu dx2−y2 orbital contributes to bands near the Fermi
energy, in FBS, Fe dxz,dyz and dxy orbitals all have signiﬁcant
contributions. The multiorbital nature of the FBS leads to a
plethora of new physics. Most notably, electronic nematicity
has ﬁrst been found to develop in the BaFe2As2 (122)
system [11–16], and then in other FBS as well [17–19]. It
is commonly accompanied by (i) splitting of the dxz and
dyz orbitals, (ii) magnetic order that breaks the C4 rotational
symmetry, and (iii) lowering of lattice symmetry from C4 to
C2. Yet there are situations when not all these features are
present. For instance, recent work on the Fe-chalcogenide
superconductor (“11” compound) FeSe shows that both lattice
and orbital symmetry breaking occur at low temperature [18],
while spin correlations remain dynamic [20,21]. The lack of
magnetic order in FeSe has not prevented attempts to describe
the system in terms of spin-only models [22,23].
Close to optimal doping in the SC 11 compound
FeTe1−xSex, there is no structural transition or magnetic
ordering that breaks the C4 symmetry. Nevertheless, lifting
of the degeneracy of the dxz- and dyz-derived electronic bands
due to spin-orbit coupling has been observed [19], which is
consistent with the lowering of C4 symmetry of the local
hybridization pattern down to C2 in the presence of stripe-type
(0.5,0.5) dynamic short-range magnetic correlations detected
by neutron scattering [24,25]. The nematic susceptibility is
also found to diverge at low temperature [26]. It appears,
therefore, that changes in the orbital and spin correlations
may be behind various features observed in the FBS at low
temperature, including nematicity. Understanding which one
is the fundamental driving force is central to the debate over
the SC mechanism [27].
In this paper, we report inelastic neutron scattering mea-
surements of low-energy (≲10 meV) magnetic excitations
from a series of FeTe1−xSex samples. Since they appear
to be relevant to both SC and nematicity, the behavior of
low-energy spin ﬂuctuations in FBS is of considerable interest.
We show that, in the SC samples, upon heating, in addition
to the change of in-plane spin correlations from stripe AFM
QSAF = (0.5,0.5) to bicollinear double-stripe AFM QDSAF =
(0.5,0) as reported before [25], the development of the
interplanar spin correlations for low-energy spin ﬂuctuations
also becomes apparent. Speciﬁcally, the low temperature state
with stripe AFM in-plane correlations is virtually 2D, with
very weak correlations perpendicular to the Fe planes. The high
temperature state, however, shows clear correlations between
the Fe planes for slowly ﬂuctuating spins, with the interplanar

dynamic correlation length approaching the intraplanar one.
Similar effects can also be achieved by changing the chemical
composition toward nonsuperconducting (NSC) phases. While
it is common to observe 2D magnetic correlations at high
temperature that evolve into 3D correlations (or order) at low
T, we do not know of any examples of the converse. This highly
unusual crossover from a 3D-type spin-liquid at high T to a
2D-type spin-liquid state at low T cannot be explained with
effective spin-only models; it is likely due to the change of
hybridizations between the Fe dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals, which
implies that the low temperature physics in the 11 material is
orbitally driven.
The single crystal Fe1−z(Ni)zTe1−xSex samples used in
this experiment were grown by a unidirectional solidiﬁ-
cation method [28] at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Two SC samples were used, one with optimal doping,
FeTe0.6Se0.4 (SC40) with Tc ∼14 K, and another with 2%
Ni doping, Fe0.98(Ni)0.02Te0.55Se0.45 (Ni02) with TC = 8 K.
The two NSC samples used in these measurements are
Fe1.1Te0.3Se0.7 (NSC70) and Fe0.9(Ni)0.1Te0.55Se0.45 (Ni10).
The neutron scattering experiments1 were performed on
the time-of-ﬂight instruments SEQUOIA (BL-17) [29] and
1We use the unit cell that contains two iron atoms. The lattice
constants are a = b ≈3.8 ˚A, and c ≈6 ˚A. The data are described
in reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) of (a∗,b∗,c∗) = (2π/a,2π/b,2π/c).
The measurements in the (HK0) plane were taken on SEQUOIA with
the incident neutron beam along the sample [001], Ei = 50 meV, and
a chopper frequency of 360 Hz. For the measurements in the (HHL)
and (H0L) planes taken on HYSPEC, the samples were mounted
with [1¯10] and [010] vertically, respectively, perpendicular to the
HYSPEC (BL-14B) [30] at the Spallation Neutron Source
and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and the BT7
triple-axis-spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron
Research.
Low-energy magnetic excitations (¯hω = 7 meV) in the
(HK0) plane from the SC40 and Ni10 samples are shown
in Fig. 1. Here the data are integrated along the out-of-plane
direction. One can see that in the SC40 sample, the low-energy
magnetic excitations appear around (0.5,0.5) in-plane wave
vector for T ∼Tc, and there is a clear enhancement of the
intensity due to the spin resonance for T < Tc. As discussed
in previous work [25,31], the low energy spectral weight
from SC 11 samples shifts from QSAF to QDSAF in-plane
wave vector upon heating, reﬂecting a change of in-plane
low-energy spin correlations from the “stripe” type to the
“double stripe/bicollinear” type. This behavior is observed
in SC40 as well when the temperature is raised signiﬁcantly
above Tc [Fig. 1(c)]. The same measurements from NSC
samples show that the low-energy spin excitations are always
around QDSAF = (0.5,0) [32] with little variation with T
[Fig. 1(d)].
To probe the out-of-plane spin correlations, we measured
the L dependence of the magnetic scattering intensities. We
ﬁrst performed measurements in the (HHL) plane, mainly for
low energies along [110] from the low temperature stripe-type
correlations, marked as the solid arrow in Fig. 1(a). In Fig. 2,
we show the intensities at ¯hω = 6.5 meV. This is the energy
where the spin-resonance occurs in optimally doped 11 SC
samples, and also where the change of spectral weight with
temperature or doping is most pronounced. In Fig. 2(a), we see
that the magnetic scattering intensity forms a narrow vertical
stripe along the L direction around (H,H) = (0.5,0.5). The
breadth of the intensity along the L direction indicates
that the real-space correlations along the c axis are weak.
When the sample is heated slightly above Tc to T = 20 K,
the extra intensity from the spin-resonance disappears, but
the shape of the low-energy spectral weight is still deﬁned
by the vertical stripe along L [Fig. 2(c)]. Linear cuts along
(0.5,0.5,L) are plotted in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d); here we
see that the L dependence of the intensities near QSAF at
low temperatures is well described by the Fe2+ magnetic
form factor, suggesting strongly 2D behavior, consistent
with previous reports on 11 SC samples [33]. It has been
observed in other FBS that the spin-resonance could have 3D
dispersions [34]. In our case, note that the 2D spin correlation
is present not only for the “spin-resonance” intensity, but also
for the low-energy spin excitations in the normal state for T
not far above Tc. When heated further to 100 K and 300 K, the
stripe-type correlations are destroyed and the intensity near
QSAF is entirely suppressed [Figs. 2(e)–2(h)]. Similarly, no
horizontal scattering plane. During the HYSPEC measurements, the
in-plane orientation of the sample was rotated to cover a range of
180o with 2o step. The data were measured with Ei = 20 meV and a
chopper frequency of 180 Hz. The area detectors of HYSPEC covered
neutrons with scattering angles from 5o to 65o. From the combined
data, the constant ¯hω slices and linear scans have been symmetrized.
Measurements on BT7 were performed with ﬁnal energy of 14.7 meV,
collimations of open-80′-80′-120′ and a PG ﬁlter after the sample.

magnetic scattering is observed along (0.5,0.5,L) from NSC
samples (not shown) for all temperatures measured.
In the NSC samples, or in SC samples but at temperatures
signiﬁcantly higher than Tc, the low-energy magnetic spectral
weight shifts to QDSAF corresponding to the bicollinear-type
in-plane spin correlations. Measurements along [100] in the
(H0L) plane [marked as the dashed arrow in Fig. 1(a)]
are plotted in Fig. 3. Here, we show 2D slices and linear
cuts at ¯hω = 4 meV. The reason for this choice of energy
transfer is to avoid possible contamination from an anomalous
phonon mode [35] that comes in around (0.5,0,0) for energies
around 7 to 8 meV. Measurements from the Ni10 sample
are plotted in Figs. 3(e)–3(h), at T = 5 K and 300 K. The
L dependence for the low-energy magnetic scattering from
the NSC sample is best described by two peaks around
L = ±0.5 r.l.u., suggesting an AFM-type correlation between
two adjacent Fe planes.2 The intensity from the NSC sample
does not change much from 5 K to 300 K, which is expected
in a liquidlike phase with strong spin-correlations.
2Note that a modiﬁed magnetic form factor, with a faster fall off, is
necessary to explain the absence of intensity at L = ±1.5; see [24].

for better comparison. Left column are 2D intensity slices, and right

H = 0.5 shows where the L cuts in the right column were taken. The
dashed lines in right panels are estimated background values obtained
from ﬁtting around (0.65,0,0). The blue solid lines in (d), (f), and (h)

the red solid lines are ﬁts to the data using two symmetric Lorentzians
peaked at L = ±0.5. All slices were taken with an energy width of 2
meV. The error bars represent statistical error.
For the SC40 sample, at base temperature (T = 5 K),
there is no magnetic scattering intensity near QDSAF [see
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], as expected. The development of spectral
weight near QDSAF in SC40 only becomes apparent when
the temperature is well above Tc. Data measured at 300 K
are shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). In contrast to the stripe-shape
intensity distributed broadly along the L direction in the
(HHL) plane at low temperature, at high temperature the
magnetic scattering in the (H0L) plane has a much narrower
span along L [Fig. 3(c)], similar to the data from the NSC
sample. The linear cut along (0.5,0,L) in Fig. 3(d) indicates
that the intensity proﬁle decreases much faster with L than
what would be expected from the magnetic form factor alone.
Compared to the results from the NSC sample, one can still
ﬁt the SC40 data with two symmetric peaks [the red line
in Fig. 3(d)] but there appears to be more intensity near
L = 0 from the SC sample instead, suggesting some possible
FM component of spin correlations between Fe planes. If
we ﬁt the data with Lorentzian functions along L and H
directions, we can obtain the dynamic correlation lengths
for slowly ﬂuctuating spins along different directions. For

SC40 sample, ξc ∼1.4(3) ˚A (with ﬁts to two symmetric
peaks at L = ±0.5), and ξab ∼1.7(4) ˚A. Compared to the
situation at low temperature, there is a dramatic enhancement
of the interplanar spin correlation in the SC sample, with the
interplanar correlation length close to the in-plane one. These
results demonstrate that the low-energy magnetic excitations
near QDSAF, either from the high-temperature phase in the SC
sample or from the NSC sample at all temperatures, appear
3D in nature.
Measurements on 11 samples with other compositions not
too close to either end (FeTe or FeSe) of the phase diagram
[Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)] conﬁrm this trend for slowly ﬂuctuating
spins with energy scales of a few meV—3D-like correlations
appear in NSC samples at all temperatures, or in SC samples at
high temperature, while 2D correlations appear in SC samples
at low temperature (temperatures lower than or comparable
to Tc). The strength of the 3D spin correlations gradually
diminishes with cooling in the SC sample [Fig. 4(c)], yet,
in the NSC sample, the spin correlations remain 3D for the
entire temperature range (5 K to 300 K) measured.
Many, if not all of these NSC 11 samples already exhibit 3D
short-range magnetic order characterized by Q ≈(0.5,0,0.5)
at low temperature [36]. It is much more of a puzzle for the 3D
spin correlation to become established at high temperature
in SC 11 samples and then change to 2D upon cooling.
The temperature scale for the 3D to 2D transformation is
signiﬁcantly higher than Tc, suggesting that it is at least not
directly tied to the SC phase transition. Also, no explicit
magnetic phase transition occurs in this temperature range,
nor does the change of the lattice structure favor such an
enhancement of the interplanar correlations—the a/c ratio
actually decreases at higher temperature in SC 11 samples [25].
Since thermal ﬂuctuations apparently work against such a
trend, it is difﬁcult if not impossible to interpret such a spon-
taneous transformation as driven by spin interactions that can
be modeled with a spin-only model. With orbital correlations
being the other important degree of freedom in FBS systems,
we look for possible explanations from the change of the
different Fe 3d orbitals. ARPES measurements [37] on a SC
11 sample show that, in addition to the lifting of degeneracy
between dxz and dyz orbitals at low temperatures due to the
spin-orbit coupling, a strong renormalization of the dxy orbital
is observed, where the dxy orbital spectral weight decreases
at higher temperature, indicative of an orbital selective Mott
transition (OSMT) [38–40]. When the dxy orbital delocalizes
upon cooling, it can hybridize and interact strongly with
the dxz and dyz orbitals. These interactions can create a
tendency for an instability that may break the C4 symmetry
at low temperature [41], thus explaining the reported growth
in nematic susceptibility [26]. Our results conﬁrm that spin
correlations are also signiﬁcantly affected by this OSMT —
when the dxy electrons become less itinerant and carry more
local moment at high temperatures, an enhancement of the
interplanar spin correlations is observed in the low-energy
spin channel. This behavior is reminiscent of the orbital
selective electronic localization at high temperature that was
ﬁrst observed in the 11 parent material FeTe [24,42]. In other
words, while changes in both orbital and spin channels occur
in the same temperature range, the change of spin correlations
is likely a result of changing orbital correlations.
Although no electronic nematic order is present in our
samples at low temperature, the 2D low-energy spin excitations
around (0.5,0.5) are directly related to nematicity observed
in both FeSe [21] and other FBS systems [16]. It is also
noteworthy that in the 11 system, as well as in many other
FBS, the Fermi surface at low temperature typically forms 2D
cylinders at  and X points [43,44]. In the 11 system we found
that the low-energy magnetic excitations at high temperatures
appear highly 3D and are located around in-plane wave-vector
QDSAF = (0.5,0). If they are indeed the bosons that mediate SC
pairing at low temperature, these excitations apparently need
to become quasi-2D and appear near in-plane wave-vector
QSAF = (0.5,0.5) to satisfy the nesting conditions. With the
scenario discussed above, a change in the orbital hybridization
is therefore essential for this evolution to quasi-2D spin
correlations to occur before superconductivity can set in. Such
doping and temperature dependent changes of the orbital
hybridization pattern have been recently proposed in the
context of the evolution of the in-plane correlations [24]. Our
results thus strongly support the idea that both nematicity and
superconductivity in the 11 system appear to be fundamentally
orbital-driven. This conclusion clearly has signiﬁcance not just
for the 11 system but for all other FBS as well.
