We use neutron diffraction to study the structure and magnetic phase diagram of the newly discovered
pressure-induced superconductor CrAs. Unlike most magnetic unconventional superconductors where the
magnetic moment direction barely changes upon doping, here we show that CrAs exhibits a spin reorientation from
the ab plane to the ac plane, along with an abrupt drop of the magnetic propagation vector at a critical pressure
(Pc ≈0.6 GPa). This magnetic phase transition, accompanied by a lattice anomaly, coincides with the emergence
of bulk superconductivity. With further increasing pressure, the magnetic order completely disappears near the
optimal Tc regime (P ≈0.94 GPa). Moreover, the Cr magnetic moments tend to be aligned antiparallel between
nearest neighbors with increasing pressure toward the optimal superconductivity regime. Our ﬁndings suggest
that the noncollinear helimagnetic order is strongly coupled to structural and electronic degrees of freedom, and
that the antiferromagnetic correlations between nearest neighbors might be essential for superconductivity.

Most unconventional superconductors, including cuprates
and iron-based superconductors, are derived from chemical
doping or application of pressure on their collinearly magnetic-
ordered parent compounds [1–5]. The recently discovered
pressure-induced superconductor CrAs, as a rare example
of a noncollinear helimagnetic superconductor, has therefore
generated great interest in understanding microscopic mag-
netic properties and their interplay with superconductivity
[6–8]. Previous measurements have shown that CrAs exhibits
a ﬁrst-order noncollinear helimagnetic phase transition, ac-
companied by a magnetostriction below TN ≈270 K [9–13].
The resistivity of CrAs also displays a clear anomaly around
the N´eel temperature [6,7,14]. This anomaly is suppressed
progressively under pressure and fades away at P > 0.6
GPa, before bulk superconductivity appears [6,7,15]. The
maximum Tc ≈2 K is attained at P ≈1 GPa, above which
Tc decreases with increasing pressure [6,7]. It has also been
revealed that the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate in CrAs
shows substantial magnetic ﬂuctuations, but does not display
a coherence peak in the superconducting state, indicating an
unconventional pairing mechanism [15]. Moreover, neutron
diffraction measurements suggested that pressure does not
change the magnetic structure but partially suppresses the
magnetic ordering moment at P ⩽0.65 GPa [16]. However,
there was signiﬁcant pressure inhomogeneity in the cell with
a ﬂuorocarbon-based ﬂuid pressure medium in Ref. [16], as
two sets of Bragg peaks were visible [17]. Therefore, the
precise crystal and magnetic structure under pressure remains
unsettled [17]. This elucidation is important to establish
*zhaoj@fudan.edu.cn
whether and what kind of magnetism is directly associated
with superconductivity in this system.
We used neutron diffraction to study the structural and
magnetic ordering properties of CrAs. A high quality poly-
crystalline sample was synthesized as reported in Ref. [13].
Our measurements were carried out on the BT-1 powder
diffractometer, SPINS cold triple-axis spectrometer, and BT-7
thermal triple axis spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron
Research [18].
Figure 1(c) illustrates the diffraction pattern at 4 K at
ambient pressure, which can be described by a noncollinear
double helimagnetic structure [Fig. 1(a)]. Similar to earlier
work [10,16], the Cr magnetic moment [1.724(9)μB] lies
in the ab plane, and the helical propagation vector is ⃗k =
(0,0,0.356 43). To determine the evolution of the magnetic
structure under pressure, we carried out more measurements in
an aluminum alloy (P < 0.65 GPa) or steel (P > 0.65 GPa)
pressure cell. Helium was used as the pressure medium to
minimize pressure inhomogeneity [17]. Figure 1(d) shows the
diffraction pattern at P = 0.4 GPa and T = 4 K. Magnetic
reﬁnements conﬁrm that the magnetic structure is similar
to that at ambient pressure, except for the slightly reduced
propagation vector (0,0,0.3171) and moment [1.71(2)μB].
The change in the magnetic propagation vector was not found
in previous work at a similar pressure [16,17]. Most notably,
the diffraction pattern at P = 0.6 GPa [Fig. 1(e)] shows
substantial changes in the magnetic reﬂections compared to
those at ambient and low pressures, indicative of a magnetic
phase transition. Our reﬁnement analysis reveals that these
changes are due to a spin reorientation from the ab plane to
the ac plane, together with a rapid decrease of the magnetic
propagation vector to ⃗k = (0,0,0.2080), as shown in Fig. 1(b).

(d) The diffraction pattern at P = 0.4 GPa and T = 4 K. The four reﬁned phases are crystal and magnetic structures of CrAs, the second- and

the aluminum pressure cell. (e) The diffraction pattern at P = 0.6 GPa and T = 50 K.
It should be noted that this spin reorientation does not conﬂict
with earlier NMR measurements [15], because the weak
and broad NMR spectra observed at P > 0.53 GPa cannot
distinguish the spin directions revealed by current neutron
measurements. In addition, the nuclear peaks can be described
by an orthorhombic Pnma space group. The reﬁned structural
and magnetic parameters at representative temperatures and
pressures are given in Table I.
Figure 2 summarizes the structural and magnetic phase
transitions under various pressures. At ambient pressure, the
(0,0,0)± magnetic peak abruptly disappears on warming to
TN = 272 K [Figs. 2(a) and 2(k)]. Similar behavior is also
observed at P = 0.4 GPa [Figs. 2(c) and 2(l)]. At the critical
pressure Pc = 0.6 GPa, the magnetic peak shows a spin
reorientation behavior from the ab plane to the ac plane
below Tr = 88 K [Figs. 2(e) and 2(m)]. With further increasing
pressure to P = 0.72,0.82 GPa, the magnetic moment stays
in the ac plane, while its magnitude is further reduced.
Accompanied by the magnetic phase transitions, structural
phase transitions are also observed [Figs. 2(b), 2(d), 2(f),
2(h), 2(j), and 2(k)–2(o)], even though the crystal symmetry
remains unchanged below and above the N´eel temperature.
The temperature-dependent proﬁle of nuclear peaks shows
a sudden shift near the N´eel temperature, indicative of
discontinuous changes of lattice parameters [Figs. 2(b), 2(d),
2(f), 2(h), 2(j), and 4(a)–4(c)].
Figure 3(a) summarizes the pressure and temperature
dependence of the propagation vector. Obviously, the propaga-
tion vector decreases gradually with decreasing temperature at
P = 0 and 0.4 GPa, when the magnetic moment is in the
ab plane, which is similar to previous results at ambient
pressure [10]. Conversely, the propagation vector actually
increases slightly with decreasing temperature at P = 0.72
and 0.82 GPa, when the magnetic moment has rotated to the
ac plane. At Pc ≈0.6 GPa, the propagation vector decreases
drastically on cooling through Tr = 88 K, owing to the spin

reorientation. The dramatically pressure- and temperature-
dependent magnetic propagation vector observed here is differ-
ent from the weakly pressure- and temperature-dependent spin
density wave vector of metallic chromium [19,20]. Moreover,
the nearest-neighbor Cr-Cr distances (d = 2.856, 3.090, and
3.588 ˚A; P = 0 GPa, T = 5 K) in CrAs are larger than that
(∼2.498 ˚A) of chromium. These results, together with the fact
that the magnetic moment of CrAs is much larger than in
metallic chromium (∼0.6μB [19]), suggest that Cr moments
are more localized in CrAs.
To summarize the data in Figs. 1, 2, and 3(a), we plot in
Fig. 3(b) the structural and magnetic phase diagram of CrAs
under pressure, along with the superconducting transition tem-
peratures determined from resistivity measurements [6,7,15].
Both the magnetic and structural phase transition temperature
and the magnetic moment are gradually suppressed by pressure
and eventually completely disappear at P ≈0.94 GPa, where
optimal Tc is realized [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)]. In contrast
to previous resistivity measurements that suggest that the
magnetic order is completely suppressed above P > 0.6 GPa
[6,7,13], our neutron data show that the magnetic order
and structural distortion persist at P = 0.72, 0.82, and 0.88
GPa, where the resistivity anomaly disappears [Fig. 3(b)]. As
the pressure dependence of the propagation vector shows a
sudden drop at Pc ≈0.6 GPa [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], which
is accompanied by the spin reorientation, the diminishing
resistivity anomaly is very likely due to the spin reorientation
transition. Interestingly, an anomaly on the N´eel temperature
versus pressure curve is also observed at P = 0.72 GPa
[Fig. 3(b)], probably due to the competition between the
high propagation vector phase and the low propagation vector
phase near the spin reorientation transition. More importantly,
as shown in Fig. 3(b), the contour propagation vector map
and the superconducting transition temperature plot reveal
that the emergence of superconductivity is directly associated
with the spin reorientation and the subsequent decrease in the
propagation vector. The superconducting volume fraction as a
function of pressure further proves that the emergence of bulk
superconductivity coincides with the drop in the propagation
vector [Fig. 3(c)]. These results indicate a strong interplay
between magnetism and superconductivity in this system. We
note that recent muon spin rotation (μSR) measurements also
revealed the competition between the superconducting and the
magnetic phase fractions in a similar pressure region [21].
Figure 4 illustrates the pressure effect of the lattice
constants, Cr-Cr distances, and angles between Cr moments
at various temperatures obtained from our reﬁnement analy-
sis. At ambient pressure, a large magnetostriction (b/b =
3.45%, a/a = −0.29%, c/c = −0.84%, v/v = 2.28%,
P = 0 GPa) is observed below the N´eel temperature
[Figs. 4(a)–4(c)]. The increased volume of the unit cell
below TN naturally suggests that the magnetic order could
be suppressed by reducing magnetostriction under pressure.
However, the magnetostriction (b/b = 5.69%, a/a =
−0.88%, c/c = −1.36%, v/v = 3.33%, P = 0.6 GPa)
actually increases with increasing pressure. On the other hand,

that in (l), the decrease of the (000±)M peak intensity at low temperature is due to the decrease of the phase angle β12 on cooling, as shown in
Fig. 4(g). The error bars indicate one standard deviation.

FIG. 3. Structural and magnetic phase diagram of CrAs. (a) Temperature and pressure dependence of the magnetic propagation vector.
The open and solid circles indicate the magnetic moment in the ab and ac plane, respectively. (b) Structural and magnetic phase diagram of
CrAs. The contour propagation vector map is plotted from the data in (a) in the temperature-pressure space. The superconducting transition
temperatures are adapted from Refs. [6,7,15]. (c) The pressure dependence of the propagation vector and the superconducting volume fraction
determined by susceptibility measurements adapted from Ref. [6]. Different from Refs. [7,15], indication of superconductivity was also
observed at 0.29 ⩽P ⩽0.5 GPa in Ref. [6] (open squares). However, in this pressure range, the superconductivity is ﬁlamentary rather than a
bulk phenomenon because the superconducting volume fraction is extremely low (⩽15%) and the resistivity exhibits multiple superconducting
transitions [6]. The superconducting volume fraction increases signiﬁcantly above 0.6 GPa, when the spin-reoriented low-vector phase is fully
developed. The same color code as in (b) is used, which indicates the amplitude of propagation vector. (d) The pressure dependence of the
magnetic moment at 4 K.
pressure signiﬁcantly reduces the nearest-neighbor Cr-Cr
lengths [Figs. 4(e) and 4(f)], which could make the d electrons
of Cr more itinerant, and therefore reduce the magnetic
moment. More interestingly, the pressure dependence of the
lattice parameters in the magnetically order state displays a
clear anomaly at the critical pressure Pc = 0.6 GPa [Fig. 4(d)],
which corresponds to the spin reorientation transition and
the emergence of bulk superconductivity [Figs. 3(b) and
3(c)]. These observations suggest a strong coupling between
electronic, magnetic, and lattice degrees of freedom. We also
notice that the angle β12 between Cr moments S1 and S2
decreases drastically from ∼−100◦(almost perpendicular)
to ∼−160◦(almost antiparallel) with increasing pressure
P > 0.6 GPa [Fig. 4(g)]. The angle β23 between S2 and
S3 is close to 180◦and barely changes with pressure
[Fig. 4(h)]. These results indicate that the moments between
nearest neighbors tend to be antiferromagnetically aligned
in the bulk superconductivity regime. If superconductivity
is indeed mediated by ﬂuctuations of the magnetic order in
this system, these results may suggest that antiferromagnetic
ﬂuctuations are crucial for superconductivity.
It is interesting to compare the electronic phase dia-
gram of CrAs with that of other magnetic unconventional
superconductors [1–3,5,22]. Unlike cuprates and iron-based
superconductors where chemical doping or application of
pressure only reduces the magnitude of the magnetic moment
while leaving the moment direction essentially unchanged
[1,2], pressure induces a spin reorientation transition in CrAs.
The highly tunable noncollinear magnetic structure under
pressure and the large magnetostriction observed in CrAs are
likely due to the frustrated magnetic exchange interactions,
which resembles the behavior of multiferroic materials with
noncollinear magnetic structures [23]. Indeed, the decrease of
the magnetic propagation vector can be qualitatively under-
stood by considering a minimum magnetic exchange model
and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions [24,25]. As
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), the interaction between spin ˆSi
and ˆSj can be generally written as
ˆHij = ⃗Dij · ( ˆSi × ˆSj) + Jij ˆSi · ˆSj,
(1)
where
⃗D and J are the DM interaction unit vector and
nearest-neighbor exchange coupling, respectively. ⃗Dij is pro-
portional to ( ⃗RAsij,1 + ⃗RAsij,2 −⃗RCri −⃗RCrj ) × ( ⃗RCri −⃗RCrj ),
where ⃗RAsij,α are coordinates of the As atoms that link ˆSi
and ˆSj spins [26]. Then we obtain ⃗D12 = ⃗D ∼D0(−0.17, −
0.5,0.85), ⃗D23 = 0. By symmetry, we have H12 = H34. There-
fore, the minimum model to describe one helix chain along the
c axis is given by
ˆH =

i
⃗D · ( ˆSi,1 × ˆSi,2 + ˆSi,3 × ˆSi,4)
+ J1( ˆSi,1 · ˆSi,2 + ˆSi,3 · ˆSi,4)
+ J ′
1( ˆSi,2 · ˆSi,3 + ˆSi,1 · ˆSi+1,4).
(2)
With J ′
1 > 0, it accounts for the antiferromagnetic spin
orientation between S2 and S3. The angle β12 is given by

tan(β12) = ⃗D · ⃗n/J1, where ⃗n deﬁnes the helix spin rota-
tion plane. The propagation vector ⃗k = (0,0, 2|β12+β23|

). As
the component of ⃗D along the c axis is larger than that
along the b axis, the propagation vector decreases if the
rotation plane changes from the ab plane [⃗n = (0,0,1)] to
the ac plane [⃗n = (0,1,0)], since β23 is close to 180◦in
both phases.
The direct connection between the emergence of super-
conductivity and the spin reorientation has been observed
in a ferromagnetic superconductor URhGe near a quantum
critical point induced by magnetic ﬁeld [27,28], but has not
been observed in other magnetic superconductors without a
net macroscopic magnetic moment. Interestingly, the normal
state resistivity of CrAs under pressure follows the power-law
relationship, indicating the presence of a magnetic quantum
critical point [6]. However, in contrast to URhGe, the spin
reorientation in CrAs is also accompanied with an abrupt
reduction of the magnetic propagation vector. Theoretical
studies have shown that the spin ﬂuctuations at a relatively
large wave vector tend to lead to a singlet pairing, while that
at a small wave vector close to q = 0 would favor a triplet
pairing [1–5,22,29,30]. If these theories apply in CrAs, it
would imply that the pairing state in CrAs could be wave
vector/pressure dependent. It is of great theoretical importance
if the pairing symmetry could be tuned in a controlled
manner in a helimagnetic superconductor [8]. Very recently,
pressure-induced superconductivity was also observed in a
similar double helimagnet MnP [31]. It would be interesting
to see if the helical magnetic structure of MnP evolves in a
similar way as that of CrAs in proximity to the superconducting
dome.
In summary, we have determined the structural and mag-
netic phase diagram of CrAs under pressure. We show that
CrAs exhibits a spin reorientation together with a rapid
decrease of the magnetic propagation vector above the critical
pressure (Pc ≈0.6 GPa), where bulk superconductivity begins

to emerge. Moreover, the nearest-neighbor spins tend to be
aligned antiparallel near the optimal superconductivity regime,
which suggests that antiferromagnetic correlations between
nearest neighbors may be essential for superconductivity. The
highly tunable magnetic moment direction and propagation
vector observed in CrAs open up different avenues of research
into the interplay between noncollinear helimagnetism and
unconventional superconductivity.
