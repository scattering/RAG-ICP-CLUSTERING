Magnetic structures and dynamics of multiferroic systems
obtained with neutron scattering
William Ratcliff1, Jeffrey W Lynn1, Valery Kiryukhin2, Prashant Jain3 and Michael R Fitzsimmons3
Multiferroics are materials that evince both ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters. These order parameters when coupled can
lead to both exciting new physics as well as new device applications. Potential device applications include memory, magnetic ﬁeld
sensors, small antennas and so on. Since Kimura’s discovery of multiferroicity in TbMnO3, there has been a renaissance in the study
of these materials. Great progress has been made in both materials discovery and in the theoretical understanding of these
materials. In type-II systems the magnetic order breaks the inversion symmetry of the material, driving a secondary ferroelectric
phase transition in which the ferroelectric polarisation is exquisitely coupled to the magnetic structure and thus to magnetic ﬁeld.
In type-I systems, the magnetic and ferroelectric orders are established on different sublattices of the material and typically are
weakly coupled, but electric ﬁeld can still drive changes in the magnetisation. Besides single-phase multiferroics, there has been
exciting progress in composite heterostructures of multiferroics. Here, we review neutron measurements of prototypical examples
of these different approaches to achieving multiferrocity.

INTRODUCTION
Neutron scattering plays an important role in determining the
ferroelectric properties of multiferroics in terms of the detailed
crystal structure, but the central role is in elucidating the magnetic
structures and spin dynamics, and in understanding the origin of
how, and how strongly, the magnetic and ferroelectric order
parameters are coupled. We ﬁrst review very brieﬂy the key
neutron techniques employed to investigate multiferroics, both in
bulk and thin-ﬁlm forms. We emphasise the role of magnetic
scattering here but also reference the standard techniques for
crystal structure reﬁnements and exploring the lattice dynamics,
which are similar in concept to magnetic Bragg scattering and
measuring the spin dynamics, respectively. We then discuss
two systems which are prototypes for a type-I multiferroic
material (HoMnO3), and a type-II multiferroic material (TbMnO3).
The type I ferroelectrics typically have high-ferroelectric transition
temperatures—well above room temperature—but low magnetic
ordering temperatures, and these two disparate order parameters
are weakly coupled. The type II ferroelectrics are typically materials
with low magnetic ordering temperatures, where the magnetic
structure itself breaks the inversion symmetry and permits
(typically very weak) ferroelectric order to develop. Both are
interesting from a fundamental point of view, but so far only some
of the type I materials exhibit both types of orders at room
temperature and thus appear to have promise for applications
such as memory, spintronics and sensors. One such type I
multiferroic is BiFeO3, which is the leading candidate material for
applications, and we discuss the results for bulk crystals and thin
ﬁlms. We then explore the properties of nanocomposites and
hybrid inorganic-organic materials, and conclude with prospects
for further work.
DIFFRACTION (STRUCTURE) AND INELASTIC SCATTERING
(DYNAMICS)
Neutron scattering have a central role in determining the crystal
and magnetic structures of a vast variety of materials. One
traditional role in the magnetically ordered regime has been the
measurement of magnetic Bragg intensities, which can be used to
determine the fundamental nature and symmetry of the magnetic
state. Quantitative values of the ordered moment(s) as a function
of temperature, pressure and applied magnetic ﬁeld can be
determined, as well as the density of unpaired electrons that
constitute the magnetic moments. These are elastic scattering
measurements (no change in the energy of the neutrons) which
are carried out on single crystals, powders, thin ﬁlms and
multilayers. For thin ﬁlms and multilayers the specialized elastic
scattering technique of neutron reﬂectometry is employed, which
can determine both the atomic and magnetic density depth
proﬁles averaged over the area of the ﬁlm. For large scale
structures (1–1,000 nm) the technique of (elastic) small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) is used. Neutron diffraction studies
often provide information that can be obtained by no other
experimental technique. In the investigation of the spin dynamics
of systems, e.g., neutrons play a truly unique role. Neutron
scattering is the only technique that can directly determine the
complete magnetic excitation spectrum, whether it is in the form
of the dispersion relations for spin wave excitations, wave vector
and energy dependence of critical ﬂuctuations, crystal ﬁeld
excitations, moment ﬂuctuations and so on, which can be readily
compared with theory. Techniques employing the spin-dependent
scattering of the neutron can be used to unambiguously identify
nuclear scattering from magnetic scattering, both for magnetic/
crystal structures and for excitations. More detailed reviews of
neutron magnetic scattering techniques, including the theory of

neutron scattering from magnetic systems and solids, can be
found in references 1–5.
POLARISED NEUTRON REFLECTOMETRY (PNR)
PNR is ideally suited to measure the nuclear and magnetisation
depth proﬁles across planar interfaces. Because reﬂection only
occurs when one or both of the nuclear or magnetic compositions
change across an interface, PNR can distinguish magnetism at
interfaces and other nanoscale structures from contamination
within a substrate or on the sample.6 Extensive reviews of PNR can
be found in references 7–9.
Brieﬂy, in PNR the intensity of the specularly reﬂected neutron
beam is compared with the intensity of the incident beam as a
function of wavevector transfer, Q ( = 4πsinθ/λ, where, θ is angle of
incidence and λ is the neutron wavelength), and neutron beam
polarisation (Figure 1a). Q is changed by changing θ (typically of
order 1°) or λ (typically of order 0.2–1.4 nm). The specular
reﬂectivity, R, is determined by the neutron scattering length
density (SLD) depth proﬁle, ρ(z), averaged over the lateral
dimensions of the sample. The SLD is the depth-dependent
variation of the index of refraction (related to ρ(z)) of the sample.
Although the reﬂectivity close to the origin is highly non-
kinematical, the reﬂectivity at larger Q can be thought of in terms
of the square of the modulus of the Fourier transform of the SLD
proﬁle. (Widely available numerical codes permit rigorous analysis
including the non-kinematical behaviour of the reﬂectivity for
all Q.) ρ(z) consists of nuclear and magnetic SLDs such that
ρ±(z) = ρn(z) ± CM (z), where C = 2.9109 × 10−9 Å −2(kA/m) −1, and
M(z)
is
the
magnetisation
(kA/m)
depth
proﬁle.8,9
Unlike
magnetometry, which measures magnetic moment, reﬂection of
polarised neutron beams depends on a variation of moment
density across a planar interface. Further, unlike non-resonant
X-ray scattering, the nuclear and magnetic neutron scattering
lengths have comparable magnitudes. The +(−) sign in ρ ±(z)
denotes neutron beam polarisation parallel (opposite) to the
applied magnetic ﬁeld and corresponds to spin-dependent
reﬂectivities, R±(Q). By measuring R+(Q) and R−(Q), ρn(z) and M(z)
can be obtained separately. If the net magnetisation is rotated
away from the applied ﬁeld, polarisation analysis of the specularly
reﬂected beam provides information about the projection of the
net magnetisation vector onto the sample plane. For example,
polarisation analysis with PNR is useful for identifying the magnetic
orientations of different layers parallel to the sample plane.

SMALL-ANGLE NEUTRON SCATTERING
SANS is ideally suited to measure the change of nuclear and
magnetisation contrast across non-planar interfaces. In SANS
experiments the incident neutron beam is tightly collimated in
two orthogonal directions (Figure 1b). SANS provides information
about regions, domains and particles bounded by interfaces
across which either the nuclear or magnetic SLD changes. The
length scales probed by SANS vary between a few nanometres
and microns. Because of the inverse relationship between length
scale and reciprocal space, short-length scales produce SANS
furthest from the primary (unscattered) beam. Like PNR, polarised
SANS allows an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the nuclear and
magnetic scattering and the relationship between the two.
Conﬁnement of scattered intensity in neutron reﬂectometry
about the specular reﬂectivity allows the use of supermirrors for
polarisation analysis with relative ease. However, polarisation
analysis
of
widely
divergent
SANS
with
mirrors
is
more
challenging. The availability of He3 polarising ﬁlters has recently
enabled routine polarisation analysis for SANS, allowing successful
exploitation of SANS for the unique identiﬁcation of magnetic
and structural contributions to the scattering from magnetic
materials.10–12 In some cases neutron scattering with polarisation
analysis enables measurement of correlations of magnetism that
transcend the physical non-uniformity of the material.13
Sample
environments for
neutron
scattering
experiments
routinely include cryomagnets providing ﬁelds as large as 15 T,
temperatures as low as 20 mK, pressure cells, mechanical devices
(to apply bending stress to substrates) and facilities for irradiation
with
light.
Equipment
exists
that
offers
opportunities
to
simultaneously control magnetic/electric ﬁelds, temperature and
pressure—of obvious interest to studies of magnetoelectric
multiferroic materials.
TYPE-I MULTIFERROIC: HOMNO3
The hexagonal (space group P63cm) rare-earth manganese oxides
(RMnO3 with R = Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and Y) are a family of
multiferroic materials of particular interest, and HoMnO3 is a
prototypical system representative of these hexagonal materials
that has been investigated in considerable detail. In this material
the Ho–O ions undergo a displacement at very high temperature
(TC = 1375 K),14 which gives rise to a ferroelectric (FE) moment
along the c axis. Long-range magnetic order, on the other hand,
develops for the Mn moments at 72 K. The disparate ordering
temperatures indicate that this system is a type-I multiferroic
where the order parameters are relatively weakly coupled through
the Ho–Mn exchange and anisotropy interactions. The magnetic
system has the added interest that the Mn moments occupy a
frustrated triangular lattice as shown in Figure 2. Below the
magnetic ordering temperature (TN = 72 K) the Mn spins order in a
noncollinear 120° spin structure. At 40 K a spin reorientation
(TSR = 40 K) takes place in which the Mn moments rotate in the
Figure 2.

side (c axis is up). Large blue balls are Ho, red balls are oxygen. The
Mn ions sit at the centre of each tetrahedron of oxygen ions.
(b) View along the c axis. Note the triangular conﬁguration of the
Mn (oxygen tetrahedra) as well as the Ho. The oxygen that make up
the sides of each tetrahedron also exhibit triangular coordination.

these phases are shown on the right. Ho3+ moments (not shown) order in the low-temperature phase. (Adapted from reference 17.)

plane, changing the magnetic symmetry and adopting a different
120° spin structure. At low temperatures the Ho moments order
antiferromagnetically (THo = 8 K) with moments aligned along the
c axis, accompanied by a second spin reorientation transition of
the Mn moments into the P63cm 120° spin structure phase. The
spin structures in these phases are shown in Figure 3. The sharp
magnetic transitions shown in the ﬁgure are accompanied by
sharp anomalies in the dielectric constant, indicating that the
magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters are coupled.15
Second-harmonic generation measurements as a function of
magnetic ﬁeld also show the change in magnetic symmetry and
the reentrant phase as a function of magnetic ﬁeld suggested by
dielectric susceptibility.16
The application of a magnetic ﬁeld shifts TSR to lower T,
broadens the transition, and drives HoMnO3 into a reentrant
phase as shown in the (H versus T) phase diagram of Figure 4.2
In the intermediate-temperature phase, a sufﬁciently strong
applied magnetic ﬁeld along the c axis pushes HoMnO3 into
the
high-temperature
phase,15–17
in
good
agreement
with
the phase diagram established from dielectric susceptibility
measurements.15–18 At low temperatures, as ordered Ho magnetic
order develops, the phase diagram becomes considerably more
complicated, including a balancing of the interactions to produce
a critical end point around 2T and 2K,18 indicative of the rich
physics of HoMnO3. In this temperature regime it is expected that
the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters naturally couple
since the Ho moments are magnetically ordered while the
ferroelectric order originates with the Ho–O displacements.
The spin dynamics of this non-collinear frustrated triangular
magnetic lattice has been investigated in considerable detail.

It turns out that the coupling along the c axis is very weak, so the
spin dynamics is two-dimensional in nature. A Hamiltonian that
captures the basic physics of the problem can be written as
H ¼ -

Jij Si

where Jij = J is the strength of the nearest-neighbour in-plane
antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange interaction and D is a single-
ion anisotropy. The spin-wave spectrum then consists of three
separate modes that propagate within the hexagonal plane, which
are equivalent in energy but their origins are offset in wave
vector.17,19 Figure 5 shows a comparison of the model with the
data taken at 20 K (intermediate temperature phase) along the
high-symmetry directions in reciprocal space, using J and D as
ﬁtting parameters. From these ﬁts we ﬁnd J = 2.44 meV and
D = 0.38 meV. The anisotropy was found to have a signiﬁcant
temperature dependence, which is the driving force behind the
spin reorientation transitions observed in this system. We note
that such spin reorientations do not occur in YMnO3, so it is clear
that they originate from the holmium, as has been observed in
other rare earth systems such as Nd2CuO4.20 We note that the
full-magnetic Hamiltonian for HoMnO3 including the Ho moments
and ferroelectric coupling must be considerably more complex
than Equation (1), but this very simple model establishes the
dominant magnetic interactions for this system.
TYPE-II MULTIFERROIC: TBMNO3
The orthorhombic (space group Pbnm) RMnO3 series of perovskite
manganites, where R = [Gd,Tb,Dy], show a variety of magnetic
orderings depending on the size of the R ion.21 The Mn3+ ions lie
on four Bravais lattices at the: 1 (½ 0 0), 2(½ 0 ½), 3 (0 ½ ½) and
4 (0 ½ 0) positions. These Mn3+ ions have an electronic
conﬁguration of 3t2geg with the nearest neighbour t2g electrons
having AFM couplings and the eg electrons having ferromagnetic
coupling.21 Competition between these couplings gives rise to a
variety of Mn magnetic orderings, ranging from the simple
antiferromagnetism of LaMnO3 to a complex incommensurate
ordering in TbMnO3. In addition to TbMnO3 ordering magnetically
at
41 K,
at
~28 K
a
spontaneous
ferroelectric
polarisation
develops.22–24 This polarisation can be switched at low tempera-
tures through the application of a strong magnetic ﬁeld.22
Initial studies23 of the magnetic order of TbMnO3 were able to
identify the ordering wave-vector to be along the b axis and to
determine that it was incommensurate and the incommensur-
ability changed with temperature. A symmetry analysis for the
30 K data indicated the presence of only one Fourier component
for the incommensurate wave vector, with the spins obeying
either an amplitude modulation or a spiral structure. On model
reﬁnement to the data, it was found that the moment was along
the b axis and the magnetic structure was amplitude modulated.
Thus the initial ordering of the Mn spins is in the form of a simple
longitudinally polarised spin-density wave (SDW).
Subsequent data are shown in Figure 6, taken by Kenzelmann
et al.,24 who performed a more detailed examination of the
system, in particular to elucidate the relationship between the
magnetic structure and ferroelectricity. They used representational
analysis to classify the magnetic structures possible with the
underlying space group symmetry. They found that there were

four representations (i.e., families of magnetic structures) con-
sistent with the space group symmetry and ordering wave-vector.
At high temperatures, the system orders with a single representa-
tion and is consistent with previous results. However, below 28 K
two representations are required to describe the magnetic
ordering. In this phase, the Mn moments form an elliptical spiral,
which breaks the symmetry and permits ferroelectric order to
develop. The magnetic structure is shown in Figure 6b. Later
magnetic X-ray scattering measurements further reﬁned this
picture, however, the basic physics remains the same.25 There
have been recent measurements using neutron diffraction to
examine the effects of pressure and electric ﬁelds on the magnetic
ordering in these materials.26,27
Kenzelmann et al.24 showed that the electric polarisation
observed in this system can be explained by a trilinear coupling
term in the free energy. By symmetry, this term is necessarily
absent in the simple spin density phase, but is allowed in the
phase below 28 K when the spiral component of the magnetic
order develops. This term allows ferroelectric polarisation along
the c axis, as observed. Another phenomenological model was
developed by Mostovoy28 in which the induced polarisation is
dependent
on
a
gradient
in
the
magnetisation,
while
a
microscopic model based on an inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) coupling was developed by Katsura et al.29 in which the
spontaneous ferroelectric polarisation which arises in the spiral
phase is given by: P!prij!´ ðSi
!´ Sj
!Þ. In this latter model the
ferroelectric polarisation is along the direction perpendicular to
both the spiral axis and the vector separating the moments,
rij, and is consistent with that observed in TbMnO3. Other
microscopic theoretical approaches have included ab initio
calculations,
Monte
Carlo
simulations,
and
electric
current
cancellation.30–33
In this system, the magnetic structure results from competing
interactions, and neutron scattering can be used to probe these
interactions through measurements of the spin wave spectrum.
The same Hamiltonian (Equation (1))34,35 as used for HoMnO3 can
be employed with a nearest neighbour (ab-plane) ferromagnetic
exchange, JFM, and a next-nearest-neighbour AFM interaction
JAFM between planes, along with a single-ion anisotropy. Simple
ﬁts to this model yield JFM ~ 0.15 meV, JAFM ~ −0.5 meV and
D ~ 0.13 meV.35
However, there are interesting excitations beyond simple spin
waves. One interesting mode is a ‘phason’ mode in which the
phase of the moments in the spiral is changed, but the overall
spin structure is invariant. Without anisotropy this would be a
Goldstone mode,36 however, it is shifted to ﬁnite energies
(gapped) due to the anisotropy in the system.35 Beyond this, if
we
consider
time-dependent
ﬂuctuations
of
the
magnetic
moments, these ﬂuctuations will necessarily result in ﬂuctuations
in the Si
!´ Sj
! term in the induced ferroelectric polarisation.35
There is one mode which rotates the spin plane around the c axis
and another which rotates it around the b axis. The latter
rotation35 will cause a ﬂuctuating polarisation along the a axis.
We call this hybridised mode an ‘electromagnon’, and it has
been observed by polarised inelastic neutron scattering. The
electromagnon
occurs
at
energies
consistent
with
modes
observed in optical measurements.37
Although
there
is
some
excitement
in
seeing
that
the
ferroelectric polarisation in this system arises from the magnetic
order, there is even more excitement in ﬁnding that the magnetic
order can be controlled by an electric ﬁeld as was done for
Ni3V2O8,38 and that the ferroelectric polarisation can be controlled
by magnetic ﬁelds. In TbMnO3 application of a strong magnetic
ﬁeld along either a or b axes causes the electric polarisation to
ﬂop. Speculation that the ﬂop of the ferroelectric polarisation was
caused by a ﬂop of the plane of the spiral was conﬁrmed by
examining the ﬁeld dependence of the spin wave spectrum.39
Further,
application
of
a
high-magnetic
ﬁeld
changes
the
commensurability of the magnetic order.
ROOM TEMPERATURE MULTIFERROIC: BIFEO3
BiFeO3, known as bismuth ferrite or BFO, occupies a special place
in
the
list
of
known
multiferroics.
Both
the
ferroelectric
(TC ~ 1,150 K) and magnetic (TN ~ 640 K) transition temperatures
are much higher than room temperature, and the FE polarisation
(~90 μC/cm2)
exceeds
the
values
exhibited
by
prototypical
perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO3.40 The promise for
engineering applications associated with these properties, as well
as scientiﬁc interest, has motivated signiﬁcant research activity.40
Although BFO has been known since the 1950’s,41 large single
crystals have only become available recently.42,43 Lack of high-
quality single crystals impeded early neutron studies of BFO,
consequently, several quantities of basic importance, such as
the detailed magnetic structure
and microscopic magnetic
interactions, remained unknown until the late 2000’s.
BFO exhibits a rhombohedral R3c perovskite structure which
will be described here using a pseudo-cubic notation with
a = 3.96 Å, and α ~ 89.4°. The electric polarisation points along
the elongated body diagonal—the [111] direction.40 The magnetic

structure has long been known to be of the AFM G type
(each nearest neighbour spin antiparallel), with a long period
(62 nm) cycloidal modulation superimposed.44 The modulation
can propagate along three symmetry-equivalent propagation
vectors τ1 = δ[1, −1,0], τ2 = δ[1,0, −1], and τ3 = δ[0, −1,1], all normal
to the electric polarisation, where δ ~ 0.0045 reciprocal lattice
units.43–46 In each of the three possible magnetic domains, the
spins rotate in the plane deﬁned by the polarisation vector [111],
and τ. The crystal and magnetic structures of BFO are depicted in
Figure 7a.47
Both the ferroelectric vector and the magnetic easy plane of
each of the magnetic domains are deﬁned by the crystallographic
lattice, leading to an effective magnetoelectric coupling. In this
chapter, we consider two types of magnetoelectric coupling that
allow control of the magnetic order by an applied electric ﬁeld
(a subject of special interest in multiferroics research). One type
involves switching of the electric polarisation and the other does
not. Both types originate from the magnetic anisotropy deﬁning
the plane of the cycloid. Figure 7b illustrates the ﬁrst effect. As the
electric polarisation rotates (‘switches’) in an applied electric ﬁeld,
so do the magnetic easy planes deﬁned by the ferroelectric vector
and the directions of τi that stay normal to this vector. In neutron
diffraction studies of single crystals, the volume fractions of the
different ferroelectric domains, as well as those of the magnetic
domains coupled to them, can be directly inferred from the
intensities of the appropriate Bragg peaks.43,45,46 A practical
importance of magnetoelectric coupling was demonstrated in thin
ﬁlms of BFO covered by a ferromagnetic Co/Fe layer.48 The
magnetic moment of the Co/Fe layer was coupled to the easy
plane position of the underlying BFO. As an electric ﬁeld was
applied, causing the ferroelectric polarisation to rotate, the
magnetisation of the Co/Fe layer also rotated, demonstrating
control of a ferromagnetic moment by an electric ﬁeld in a
room-temperature device (composite multiferroics are discussed
later in this chapter).
The second magnetoelectric effect revealed in neutron diffrac-
tion experiments does not involve ferroelectric switching and
occurs within a single-ferroelectric domain. As an electric ﬁeld is
applied, the populations of the three equivalent magnetic
domains deﬁned by the vectors τ1, τ2, and τ3 were found to
change.46 As one of these domains is converted to another,
the magnetic easy plane (the plane of the cycloid) rotates,
see Figure 7c. As illustrated in the same ﬁgure, the effect is
reversible. This effect makes possible stabilisation of a single
cycloidal magnetic domain in the entire macroscopic sample.
Polarised neutron diffraction has shown that the magnetic cycloid
has a single chirality (rotation direction) in a ferroelectric
monodomain crystal.46 This result is consistent with theoretical
analysis showing that the chirality of the cycloid in BFO is deﬁned
by the direction of the electric polarisation.49 The mechanism
responsible for the electric-ﬁeld-induced change of the equivalent
magnetic domain fractions is probably related to the mechanical
strain due to the inverse piezoelectric effect. As the sample
deforms, the magnetic couplings along the three vectors τi are no
longer the same (for the experimental direction of the ﬁeld along
the [001]), and one of the magnetic domains becomes preferred
energetically. This hypothesis was conﬁrmed in neutron diffraction
experiments under uniaxial pressure producing a similar strain.50
As expected, magnetic domain switching occurs as the pressure
is applied. Remarkably low pressures (o100 bar) and strains
(o10 −4) are needed for the magnetic domain switching.
This observation is of high importance for interpretation of
phenomena occurring under applied ﬁelds and with changing
temperature, as similar strains can easily appear under those
circumstances.
Novel control of magnetic order by an applied electric ﬁeld has
been demonstrated in BFO single crystals. First, the magnetic
order propagation vectors and the magnetic easy planes can be
rotated together with the electric polarisation. Or, second, the
populations of the three equivalent cycloidal magnetic domains
within a ferroelectric monodomain can also be controlled by the
ﬁeld or uniaxial pressure. Neutron diffraction was instrumental in
demonstrating these effects due to its unique ability to directly
measure the populations of all the structural and magnetic
domains in situ.
Recent neutron studies of BFO single crystals have revealed
several important features of the magnetic order. First, SANS
measurements have demonstrated51 a small tilting of the spins
out of the cycloidal plane which takes the form of a SDW, see
Figure 8. The importance of this observation is related to the
destruction of the cycloidal modulation in strained BFO ﬁlms and,
possibly, in appropriately chemically altered samples.40 In these
systems, the SDW is expected to transform into a weak
ferromagnetic component,52 which could be of prime importance

in the ( ± ) three equivalent domains are seen. In this geometry, the scattering is purely magnetic, and no signal due to the main (non-SDW)
cycloidal component is present. (Adapted from reference 51).

for applications given the rather large magnitude (~0.1μB).51
Second, observation of a weak third harmonic of the magnetic
Bragg peaks has shown53 that the cycloid is not purely circular
(the spins exhibit a slight bunching along the [111] direction),
see Figure 8a. This ‘anharmonicity’ of the cycloid is important for
interpretation of spectroscopic studies of BFO, since it affects the
selection rules and allows assignment of previously mysterious
modes.54 It also makes some of the excitation modes hybrid
(combining
magnetic
and
structural
components),
leading
to
the
possibility
of
exotic
effects,
such
as
anomalous
coupling to external ﬁelds.55 Temperature-dependent neutron
diffraction
studies
have
also
been
undertaken.53
A
rather
conventional behaviour of the magnetic order was found,
and no spin-reorientation transitions were observed. This led to
re-interpretation56 of the various bulk anomalies (in speciﬁc
heat, electric susceptibility and so on) reported below room
temperature for BFO.40
Recent synthesis of large single crystals has made possible
inelastic neutron scattering studies of BFO.57–59 This allowed
determination of the microscopic magnetic interaction para-
meters, more than 50 years since the discovery of this compound.
The overall spin wave spectrum is well described by nearest and
next-nearest neighbour AFM Heisenberg exchange constants
of 4.38 and 0.15 meV, respectively.57 Studies of low-energy
excitations indicate that the DM constant responsible for the
cycloidal modulation is ~ 0.1 meV, and the magnetic anisotropy
energy producing the cycloid’s anharmonicity is ~ 10 −2 meV.58
Subsequently, the DM coupling responsible for the SDW was
found from Raman spectroscopy to be ~ 0.05 meV,54 which is
consistent with the observed SDW magnitude.51 These measure-
ments provided a full description of the magnetic subsystem in
BFO, allowing for the ﬁrst time detailed theoretical modelling with
no ﬁtting parameters. In particular, these results are of key
importance
for
understanding
of
the
infrared
and
Raman
spectroscopies of BFO.54 Recently, anomalously large changes in
the energetics of the low-energy spin waves (speciﬁcally, modes
which correspond to oscillations of spins either within or outside
of the cycloid plane) under applied electric ﬁeld have been
reported.60 These results could open new avenues for applications
of multiferroics involving electric control of spin waves, especially
in spintronic systems. Recent progress in crystal growth and in
preparation of large monodomain BFO crystals ﬁnally makes
possible neutron studies of the low-energy magnetic and hybrid
excitations, including those in applied ﬁelds. This is an active
current research ﬁeld, with high potential for exciting results in the
near future.
For device applications, typically multiferroic materials will be
required in thin-ﬁlm form. Spatial conﬁnement of materials can
alter the properties of materials compared with the bulk. For
example, neutron scattering studies revealed that the long-range
modulation observed in bulk BFO collapses to AFM G-type order
in very thin BFO ﬁlms.61 Studies of thicker ﬁlms found modulation
of the magnetic structure, although it was still different compared
with the bulk.62,63 Further changes of the magnetic domain
populations with application of an electric ﬁeld were also
observed with neutron scattering.64 These studies show the utility
of neutron scattering for thin multiferroic ﬁlms, such as those
found in composite materials.
COMPOSITE MATERIALS
While the search for single-phase multiferroic materials exhibiting
strong intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling continues, e.g., EuTiO3
(space group Pm3m),65 other approaches using nanoengineering
to fabricate composite materials that exhibit magnetoelectric
multiferroic behaviour as an extrinsic property, show promise.
Composite materials have long been important constituents
of commercial products. By deﬁnition, composite materials
contain interfaces, and with improvements in the synthesis and
characterisation of materials at the nanoscale, the importance of

interfaces becomes preeminent. Nanoscale materials necessarily
imply that interfaces play a decisive role in determining the
response of composites to their environment. This is particularly
true when interfaces mediate magnetoelectric coupling due to
modiﬁcation of spin–orbit coupling, e.g., as in rotation of oxygen
octahedrons in a perovskite,66 hydrogen bonding in a metal
organic framework (MOF),67 (spin) exchange coupling,3,68 or
interfacial strain,69 and so on. A key requirement is to maximise
the content of interfaces in the composite. The requirement can
be realized in MOFs. Coupling may occur between the magnetic
polyhedrons (green) and acentric organic building blocks (grey)
taking place across numerous hydrogen and coordination bonds
(Figure 9a). Couplings may also occur across interfaces as in
bilayers or multilayers (Figure 9b), patterned materials (Figure 9c),
and in two-phase bulk systems with nanometre-scale grains
(Figure 9d). As coupling between different phases occurs across
interfaces, characterisation of the structure, magnetic/electronic
properties of interfaces and the inﬂuence of magnetic/electric
ﬁelds and stress is paramount. Depending on the length scales of
the interfaces, diffraction (discussed previously) or the specialized
techniques of PNR and SANS are ideally suited to probe nuclear
and magnetic structures over decades of length scales with
nanometre resolution. Furthermore, sample environment can be
constructed for neutron scattering to enable parametric studies of
structure as functions of magnetic and electric ﬁelds, temperature
and pressure.
MAGNETISM OF PLANAR INTERFACES IN COMPOSITE
MULTIFERROIC MATERIALS
An often studied prototypical composite multiferroic system
involves a thin-ﬁlm ferromagnet (e.g., (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO), CoFe
and so on) grown on BiFeO3 (BFO). As described earlier, BFO is
intrinsically a magnetoelectric multiferroic—exhibiting AFM and
ferroelectric long-range order. However, by itself BFO is not
technologically useful because it lacks the robust magnetisation of
a ferromagnet which can be used to store information, produce
spin currents and so on. To address this shortcoming, researchers
have grown ferromagnetic ﬁlms (e.g., LSMO, CoFe and so on) on
BFO and vice versa. Interfacial coupling between the FM and the
FE (BFO) across the interface produces the magnetoelectric
coupling between magnetisation and polarisation. Indeed, the
approach has met with some success; though, the coupling needs
to be strengthened for technological applications. However, the
mechanism of coupling is still unclear. In the case of LSMO/BFO
heterostructures, distortions of oxygen octahedrons66 or epitaxial
strain69 may play a role. In the case of CoFe, a material with no
magnetostriction, strain is not likely to be important. Here,
coupling between the FM and the FE may occur due to a DM
interaction that produces a canted AFM structure in the FE (which
then couples to the FM) or exchange coupling across the interface
between the FM and FE.68,5 Indeed, a net uncompensated
magnetisation in BFO ranging from 75 to 144 kA/m within a nm
or so of the FM/BFO was reported from PNR studies for
LSMO/BFO70 (Figure 10) and CoFeB/BFO61 (see Figure 3 of
reference 60). Curiously, exchange bias, which is consistent with
unidirectional anisotropy and DM interactions, was observed in
CoFeB/BFO,61 but was absent in CoFe/BFO.68 Thus, further studies
of these and other systems are required to clarify the mechanism
of magnetoelectric coupling in FM/FE heterostructures. For
example, the locations of pinned and unpinned uncompensated
magnetisation in multiferroic heterostructures can be identiﬁed
with PNR in the same way the technique was applied to studies of
FM/AFM heterostructures.71,72
In some systems, strain can mediate or enhance magneto-
electric coupling. For example, epitaxial strain from a DyScO3
(space group Pbnm) substrate stabilizes ferroelectricity and
ferromagnetism simultaneously in a thin ﬁlm of EuTiO3 when
neither property is present in the bulk.65 Recently, Singh et al.73
have been successful in inferring the magnetisation depth proﬁle
across interfaces using PNR measured as simultaneous functions
of applied magnetic ﬁeld, stress and temperature. Elastic bending
stress was applied to the thin ﬁlm using a four-point mechanical
jig. Use of the new capability for studies of strain mediated
magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures is an obvious next
step, as is development of pressure cells for neutron reﬂectometry.
MAGNETISM OF INTERFACES IN NANOCOMPOSITE
MULTIFERROIC BULK MATERIALS
Even with some of the promising developments recently realized,
the magnetoelectric coupling of (planar) composite multiferroics
remains small. Recognising that the interface is responsible for
the coupling, some researchers have proposed to increase
the interfacial component. This can be accomplished through
lithography or by self-assembly of one component, or by mixing
immiscible solutions so the resulting composite is chemically and

magnetically non-uniform at length scales of tens of nm. Probing
magnetic structures on such length scales with nm resolution, and
especially in systems in which the interfaces are buried, is
extraordinarily challenging. Fortunately, the techniques of grazing
incidence SANS (GISANS, i.e., SANS in grazing incident angle
reﬂection geometry), conventional SANS, and the especially
powerful technique of SANS with polarised neutron beams and
polarisation analysis of the scattering are ideal characterisation
tools for these problems. SANS has been effective for identifying
the correlation of magnetic lengths in materials exhibiting
magnetic and electronic phase separation,4,74 magnetisation
reversal mechanisms of nm-sized domains and domain walls in
exchange bias systems,75 and the existence of uncompensated
magnetisation in single crystals of HoMnO3.76 Notably, in the
HoMnO3 study, control of the magnetisation via AFM domain
walls as opposed to bulk magnetic order was demonstrated by
application of an electric ﬁeld during the SANS experiment. SANS
has also identiﬁed differences of magnetic structure for nano-
particles and their interfaces in bulk materials.13 An important
question SANS can answer is whether the induced magnetisation
seen in the planar heterostructures (as depicted in Figure 9b, and
reported in references 61,70) is also present in three-dimensional
composite multiferroics (as depicted in Figure 9a,d).
MULTIFERROIC HYBRID INORGANIC-ORGANIC MATERIALS
Hybrid inorganic-organic materials are one of the major growth
areas of materials science research. In particular, in the past 10
years, substantial effort has been devoted to three-dimensional
nano-porous materials, also called MOFs. This has been primarily
fuelled by record breaking surface areas reported for MOFs and
concomitant utilisation for hydrogen gas storage, CO2 sequestra-
tion and hydrocarbon separation. However, recently researchers
have utilised the dual nature of MOFs, namely inorganic and
organic components, to realise functionalities otherwise not
accessible in either category of materials. For example, Jain
et al.67 reported multiferroic behaviour in (CH3)3NH2M(HCOO)3
(M = Mn, Co, Ni and Fe) with two separate mechanisms leading to
ferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering. However, due to the
complex
twinning
below
the
ferroelectric
phase
transition
associated with hydrogen bond ordering and lack of neutron
data,
the
low
temperature
ferroelectric
structure
in
this
prototypical multiferroic MOF remains elusive.
As the name suggests, MOFs can be thought of as composite
materials made up of inorganic and organic building blocks.
Metals are bound in a solid by coordination bonds to organic
ligands with carboxylate or other functional groups. These
framework materials are held together by any combination of
coordination, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. One
can imagine an inﬁnite number of such materials with varying
topologies. The word ‘Framework’ in these materials is related to
the cooperative interaction of valence electrons of neighbouring
atoms. A consequence of these interactions is a wide range of
cooperative phenomena such as ferroelectricity, magnetism and
optical properties.
Studies of multiferroic MOFs represent a relatively new ﬁeld and
few examples of such materials are known to date. Earlier work on
multiferroic MOFs utilised ordering of guest molecules in pores.
Cui et al.77–81 reported a number of porous framework materials
which exhibit a dielectric anomaly associated with the ‘melting’(or
‘freezing’) of the positional freedom of trapped guest molecules.
For example, [Mn3(HCOO)6](C2H5OH) exhibits ferroelectric and
ferrimagnetic phase-transitions at 165 and 8.5 K, respectively. The
ferrimagnetic properties of this compound are due to the Mn2+
ions in the host lattice and the ferroelectric properties originate
from the guest ethanol molecules. However, the volatility of the
material is not conducive for technological applications.
In contrast, multiferroic behaviour reported in (CH3)3NH2M
(HCOO)3 (M = Mn, Co, Ni or Fe, which has the perovskite-like ABX3
topology, originates from the ordering of dimethyl ammonium
cations (A site)—an integral part of the framework required for
charge balancing—at the center of the ReO3 type cavity.67
Neutron diffraction studies have been carried out to shed
light on the order −disorder phase transition observed in the
mixed-valence Fe2+–Fe3+ formate framework compound [(CH3)2
NH2]n[Fe3+Fe2+(HCOO)6]n.82
A
combination
of
powder
and
single-crystal
neutron
diffraction
measurements
below
the
magnetic order transition (~37 K) have been used to determine
unequivocally the magnetic structure of this ferrimagnet. The
ferrimagnetic moment, which arises as a result of the non-
compensation of the Fe2+–Fe3+ sublattices, is calculated as the
vector sum of the magnetic moments obtained from the neutron
measurement at 2 K along the c axis, ~ 0.3 μB. The spin moments
of the Fe(6b) and Fe(12c) atoms lie strictly along the c axis, while
for those at the 18e position, the moment has a main component
along the c axis which is coupled antiferromagnetically with the
spin moments of the 6b and 12c sites. Together with a small
component in the ab-plane a rotation of the magnetic moments
materializes along the c axis.82 This duality of low and high
spin states is a convenient means to establish a robust net
magnetisation, required for technological applications.
A number of other multiferroic MOFs realized by replacing the
dimethylammonium cation with hydroxyl ammonium and ammo-
nium cations have also been reported.83,84 However, replacement
of the dimethylammonium cation with guandidinium, C(NH2)3
+, in
the copper formate analogue leads to an ordered polar structure
at room temperature due to Jahn-Teller distortions. In this Cu-
MOF, Jahn-Teller and antiferro-distortions cooperate to induce a
switchable ferroelectric polarisation by coupling to the A-site
atoms through hydrogen bonding. Most importantly, A. Stroppa
et al.85 show that a weak ferromagnetic component is coupled to
the spontaneous polarisation, and they are mutually reversible.
Several molecular coordination materials are also candidate
materials
for
magnetoelectric
hybrid
materials.
Ferroelectric
and magnetic phase transitions take place at almost the
same
temperature
(~360 K)
in
triethylmethylammonium
tetrabromoferrate(3+),
resulting
in
strong
magnetodielectric
coupling.86
CuCl4(C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2,
a
molecular
framework
material with perovskite topology, shows spontaneous ferro-
electric ordering below 340 K, which coexists with ferromagnetic
ordering below 13 K.87 In this material, the electric polarisation
results from the spatial ordering of hydrogen bonds that link the
organic cations to the inorganic copper chloride block. Buckling of
the corner-linked copper chloride octahedra drives hydrogen
bond ordering. Because the magnetic exchange pathways are
also determined by this octahedral buckling, a potentially large
magnetoelectric coupling could be possible in this material.
These molecular materials could easily rival prototypical oxide
magnetoelectric materials and require further study.
Although, neutron scattering has often been applied to
understand the magnetism of MOF materials, SANS has rarely
been applied.88 Given the rich variety of modiﬁcations possible in
this class of MOFs, for example, by alteration of organic ligand,
template, strain and recent success in making thin ﬁlms, new
avenues are available to explore in the exciting ﬁeld of multiferroic
MOFs. Neutron scattering shall prove invaluable, as they have in
oxides, in deciphering complex mechanisms in these complex
hybrid materials.
SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Studies of multiferroic phenomena have been driven by novel
materials. For potential device applications, there is a continued
push to develop materials with magnetic transitions above room
temperature. Presently, type II multiferroics with strong coupling

between ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters appear very
promising. Theory has been playing an increasing role in predicting
new materials89 with strong coupling between ferroelectric and
magnetic order parameters. Neutron scattering will continue to play
a critical role in determining the magnetic structures of these
materials and the strength of their exchange interactions, and how
they couple to the electric polarisation. Furthermore, as more
materials are studied in thin ﬁlms and composites, neutron
scattering will play an increasing role in determining the magnetic
structure of these materials. In some devices where ferromagnetic
layers are coupled to underlying multiferroic layers, neutron
reﬂectivity measurements will be critical in determining the nature
of the magnetic interactions between
the
multiferroic
and
ferromagnetic layers or composites of ferroelectric and ferromag-
netic layers that exhibit multiferroic behaviour.
