We use neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation to study the effect of in-plane uniaxial pressure on
the antiferromagnetic (AF) orthorhombic phase in BaFe2As2 and its Co- and Ni-substituted members near
optimal superconductivity. In the low-temperature AF ordered state, uniaxial pressure necessary to detwin the
orthorhombic crystals also increases the magnetic ordered moment, reaching an 11% increase under 40 MPa for
BaFe1.9Co0.1As2, and a 15% increase for BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2. We also observe an increase of the AF ordering
temperature (TN) of about 0.25 K/MPa in all compounds, consistent with density functional theory calculations
that reveal better Fermi surface nesting for itinerant electrons under uniaxial pressure. The doping dependence
of the magnetic ordered moment is captured by combining dynamical mean ﬁeld theory with density functional
theory, suggesting that the pressure-induced moment increase near optimal superconductivity is closely related
to quantum ﬂuctuations and the nearby electronic nematic phase.

Understanding the behavior of magnetism in iron super-
conductors continues to be an important topic in modern con-
densed matter physics because spin excitations may mediate
electron pairing for high-temperature superconductivity [1–7].
Some of the earliest work in this ﬁeld determined that iron
pnictides such as LaFeAsO [1,2] and BaFe2As2 [Figs. 1(a)
and 1(b)] [3–5] form static stripe antiferromagnetic (AF) order
at TN, preceded by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural
transition of the lattice at Ts (TN ⩽Ts < 300 K). While AF
order may be a spin-density wave (SDW) from nesting of
hole and electron Fermi surfaces at the  and X points in
the one-iron Brillouin zone [Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)], respectively
[8–11], it may also originate from localized moments on
individual Fe sites [12–15].
Upon hole doping to form Ba1−xNaxFe2As2, a magnet-
ically ordered state with restored tetragonal symmetry is
found near optimal superconductivity, replacing the stripe AF
ordered state [16,17]. M¨ossbauer spectroscopy experiments
ﬁnd real-space modulation of magnetic moments on Fe sites,
thus conclusively establishing that the magnetic order with
tetragonal symmetry is a SDW from itinerant electrons [18].
*pdai@rice.edu
For electron-doped BaFe2−xTxAs2 (T = Co, Ni), long-range
commensurate stripe magnetic order in BaFe2As2 evolves
into short-range incommensurate magnetic order near optimal
superconductivity [19,20], due possibly to a SDW order [19]
or a cluster spin glass [21–23]. While these results suggest
a rich variety of magnetic ground states for superconducting
iron pnictides, nematic order has recently been identiﬁed as a
unifying feature near optimal superconductivity, seen via the
resistivity anisotropy induced by in-plane mechanical strain
[24]. Since nematic order couples linearly to anisotropic strain
of the same symmetry [25,26], a determination of the effect of
uniaxial pressure on magnetism of iron pnictides should reveal
if the observed nematic susceptibility [24] is associated with
magnetic order and spin excitations.
Without uniaxial strain, BaFe2−xTxAs2 forms twinned
domains in the orthorhombic state, with AF Bragg reﬂections
occurring at (±1,0,L) and (0,±1,L) (L = 1,3,5, . . .) [7].
Uniaxial pressure has been used to mechanically detwin single
crystals by compressing along one axis of the orthorhombic
lattice, creating a preferred orientation for microscopic do-
mains [27–29]. However, even the modest amount of pressure
necessary for detwinning (∼10 MPa) also induces a signiﬁcant
(∼1–2 K) upward shift of TN in electron-doped BaFe2As2
[30–34], and changes Ts into a crossover with orthorhombic

lattice distortion at all temperatures [35]. One study combining
a phenomenological Ginsburg-Landau model with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations under uniaxial strain
suggests that the magnetic ordered moment of BaFe2As2
decreases under pressure [36]. While previous neutron scat-
tering experiments suggested this to be the case [30,31], only
(±1,0,L) was measured and it is unclear how the combined
magnetic signal at (±1,0,L) and (0, ±1,L) evolve with applied
pressure. Moreover, the bulk-averaged nature of neutron
measurements cannot distinguish a change in magnetic volume
fraction from a changing ordered moment. To conclusively
determine the effect of uniaxial strain on magnetic order, one
must combine neutron scattering with a probe such as muon
spin relaxation (μSR) [37,38].
In this Rapid Communication, we use neutron diffraction,
μSR, and combined DFT and dynamical mean ﬁeld theory
(DMFT) calculations [Figs. 1(f)–1(h)] [39,40] to study the
effect of uniaxial pressure on the AF phase transition in
BaFe2−xTxAs2. In BaFe2As2, the sample achieves nearly
100% detwinning for pressures above ∼10 MPa [Fig. 2(b)],
while the ordered magnetic moment remains constant or re-
duces very slightly, resulting in a doubling of the neutron mag-
netic scattering intensity [Fig. 2(a)] from the majority-domain
Bragg reﬂections Qstrong = (±1,0) and elimination of mag-
netic scattering from the minority domains Qweak = (0,±1)
[Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)]. By contrast, in BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2, the
scattering intensity at Qstrong = (±1,0) more than doubles for
pressures greater than ∼30 MPa [Fig. 3(a)]. We also use
μSR to show the magnetic volume fraction is not changing
while the internal magnetic ﬁeld at the muon site is increasing,
conclusively establishing that the magnetic ordered moment
is increasing under uniaxial strain. We also ﬁnd the magnetic
ordering temperature for different iron pnictides [20] increases

[Figs. 2(f) and 3(b)], consistent with our DFT calculations
of the nesting condition under pressure [11]. Our μSR
measurements also demonstrate that the AF phase transition
is broadened, indicating that the internal uniaxial strain has a
distribution for a nominally constant induced stress.
For our combined DFT and DMFT calculations in the
collinear AF state, we use the experimental crystal structure
and the same Coulomb interactions used previously for
BaFe2As2 [39,40]. We ﬁnd that uniaxial strain does indeed
enhance the ordered moment for BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 (Fig. 3),
and that the effect becomes larger for samples close to optimal
superconductivity. The inset in Fig. 1(f) shows the dependence
of the ordered magnetic moment on doping (x) and distortion
[δ = (a −b)/(a + b)], which supports a much larger increase

sample becomes increasingly detwinned, which enhances the
Qstrong = (±1,0) Bragg peak while the Qweak = (0,±1) peaks
become extinguished [red and blue dots in Fig. 1(b)] [30–33].
The striped brown boxes in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) represent the
low-temperature magnetic unit cell and its equivalent area in Q
space, while in green we show the conﬁgurations for a single
Fe ion [11].
Figure 2 summarizes our experimental results on the
uniaxial pressure effect in BaFe2As2. In Figs. 2(c) and 2(d),
we show how the Bragg peak intensity becomes redistributed
from the weak side [Qweak = (0,±1,L)] to the strong side
[Qstrong = (±1,0,L)], resulting in a near doubling of the strong
reﬂection intensity [Fig. 2(a)] while the total intensity remains
conserved [Fig. 2(b)]. Consistent with earlier work [30,31], we
ﬁnd that pressure both enhances and broadens the magnetic
phase transition. The rocking curves [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)]
at (1,0,5) and (0,1,5) were collected at IN8 at 90 K [34].
The pressure dependence of the detwinning ratio, deﬁned
as η = (I10 −I01)/(I10 + I01), and total scattering intensity
Itotal = (I10 + I01)/(I10 + I01)P=0 from both experiments are
also included in Fig. 2(b), which shows a very small re-
duction in Itotal between 0 and 5 MPa. Figures 2(e) and
2(f) show the effect of pressure on the magnetic ordering
temperature [11].
Figure 3 summarizes the uniaxial pressure dependence in
BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2. In a twinned sample, the elastic magnetic
scattering intensity at (1,0,3) should be equal to that at (0,1,3),
ignoring absorption and other instrumentation effects [11].
If magnetic moments do not react to the applied uniaxial
pressure, one would expect the scattering intensity for a fully
detwinned sample to at most double at the (1,0,3) position,
such as in Fig. 2(a) for BaFe2As2. Figure 3(a) shows this is
not the case: The scattering intensity at 20 K rises by a factor
of ∼2.5 from 0 to 40 MPa. Considering the detwinning effect,
this corresponds to a 25% increase in the scattering cross
section, which is proportional to the squared magnetic ordered
moment (M2). Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the temperature
dependence of the strong Bragg reﬂection, measured in the
[H,0,0] × [0,0,L] scattering plane, which decreases below
20 K due to the onset of superconductivity [41,42]. There is
also a slight decrease in Tc under uniaxial pressure [11,43].
Figures 3(e) and 3(f) show that the combined scattering from
Qstrong and Qweak nearly doubles in intensity from zero to
large uniaxial pressure (>50 MPa) [11]. Using these data
and the measured magnetic moment of M = 0.08μB/Fe for
BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 [20], we estimate an increase in magnetic
moment from 0.08μB/Fe to 0.092μB/Fe.
To disentangle the magnetic volume fraction from the
ordered moment in BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2, we carried out μSR
measurements using the same crystal and under the same con-
ditions [11]. We implanted muons with the spin polarization
along the sample a axis and observed fast relaxation due to
a buildup of the static internal magnetic ﬁeld. From the zero
ﬁeld (ZF)-μSR time spectra in Ref. [11], we obtained the fast
relaxation rate λ in Fig. 3(g), which is linearly proportional
to the size of the local static magnetic moment (M), together
with the volume fraction VM of magnetically ordered regions
in Fig. 3(h). In addition to conﬁrming the pressure-induced
TN increase [Fig. 1(h)], we ﬁnd that the relaxation rates
at T = 20 K and T = 3 K exhibit a ∼10%–20% increase
FIG. 4. (a) Increase of the oscillation frequency in the fast-
relaxing portion of the muon decay asymmetry, for T = 2 K

from 2.5 to 40 MPa [11], and see a decreasing trend in λ
below Tc. These μSR results are consistent with the neutron
results, where the ∼25% increase from 2.5 to 40 MPa (after
detwinning is considered) is seen in the scattering intensity
[Fig. 3(a)], proportional to M2. The fraction of the sample
exhibiting magnetic order [Fig. 3(h)] is essentially 100% below
T = 35 K with no dependence on uniaxial pressure, while it
is slightly larger and broader in the region 30 < T < 50 K
under pressure, consistent with the results of neutron scattering
[Figs. 2(e), 3(d), 3(f), and 3(g)] [30,31].
We
carried
out
similar
μSR
measurements
on
BaFe1.9Co0.1As2 (TN = 70 K). In a ZF environment, we
observe oscillations in the time spectra that indicate the
presence of long-range order, different from the spectra in
BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 [11] where the larger doping leads to sig-
niﬁcantly disordered magnetism [35,37,38,44–46]. Assuming
two muon stopping sites in BaFe2−xCoxAs2 [45], we ﬁt the
short-time coherent relaxation with a two-cosine function,
separately ﬁtting both frequencies for each temperature and
uniaxial pressure, while globally constraining the other free
parameters such as relaxation rates [11]. Figure 4(a) shows the
uniaxial pressure evolution of the fast cosine frequency in the
muon decay time spectra [Fig. 4(b)] for several temperatures.
Although 2 K is below Tc, the magnetic ﬁeld increases at
least as much as at 25 K, indicating that the magnetic phase
may not be fully saturated at 25 K. To measure the magnetic
volume fraction [Fig. 4(c)], we apply a weak (30 G) external
magnetic ﬁeld in order to clearly distinguish the fast-relaxing
component from the long paramagnetic oscillations. The
ordered phase volume saturates below ∼65 K for all pressures,

UNIAXIAL PRESSURE EFFECT ON THE MAGNETIC . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 95, 060505(R) (2017)
while for higher temperatures the magnetic transition is
broadened signiﬁcantly for BaFe1.9Co0.1As2 as it was with
BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 [Fig. 3(h)].
As the doping increases and the ordered magnetic mo-
ment correspondingly decreases, it is natural to expect that
quantum ﬂuctuations, including those related to a nematic
quantum critical point [24], become important. Here we have
demonstrated that an in-plane symmetry-breaking ﬁeld is more
effective in enhancing the ordered magnetic moment for nearly
optimally doped iron pnictides. The corresponding decrease in
Tc is consistent with the view that by slightly increasing the
orthorhombicity, the doped system effectively shifts leftward
on the phase diagram (toward the parent compound), and
demonstrates that in-plane lattice distortion is a mechanism by
which magnetism directly competes with superconductivity.
Since the doped compounds react much more sensitively to
uniaxial pressure, the enhanced magnetic properties demon-
strate the sensitivity of magnetism to quantum ﬂuctuations near
optimal superconductivity, suggesting that nematic order is
associated with both magnetism and optimal superconductivity
in iron pnictides [24,25].
