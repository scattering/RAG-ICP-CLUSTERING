An essential step toward elucidating the mechanism of superconductivity is to determine the sign or
phase of the superconducting order parameter, as it is closely related to the pairing interaction. In
conventional superconductors, the electron-phonon interaction induces attraction between electrons near
the Fermi energy and results in a sign-preserved s-wave pairing. For high-temperature superconductors,
including cuprates and iron-based superconductors, prevalent weak coupling theories suggest that the
electron pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations which lead to repulsive interactions, and therefore that
a sign-reversed pairing with an s or d-wave symmetry is favored. Here, by using magnetic neutron
scattering, a phase sensitive probe of the superconducting gap, we report the observation of a transition
from the sign-reversed to sign-preserved Cooper-pairing symmetry with insignificant changes in Tc in the
S-doped iron selenide superconductors KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2. We show that a rather sharp magnetic resonant
mode well below the superconducting gap (2Δ) in the undoped sample (z ¼ 0) is replaced by a broad
hump structure above 2Δ under 50% S doping. These results cannot be readily explained by simple spin
fluctuation-exchange pairing theories and, therefore, multiple pairing channels are required to describe
superconductivity in this system. Our findings may also yield a simple explanation for the sometimes
contradictory data on the sign of the superconducting order parameter in iron-based materials.

The prevailing paradigm of iron-based superconductors
consists of the concept of Cooper pairing to a great degree
due to interband interactions, stemming from spin fluctua-
tions [1]. This belief is supported by several studies. For
instance, iron-based superconductivity exists in the vicinity
of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered ground state [2];
strong spin fluctuations whose momentum structure matches
the Fermi surface geometry are obtained theoretically and
documented experimentally [1–4]. Moreover, ab initio cal-
culations show that the electron-phonon coupling is very
small [5]. The main consequence of the domination of the
interband coupling due to spin fluctuations is the existence of
sign-reversedpairing symmetry. Magnetic neutron scattering
is an important tool to probe the relative phase of the
superconducting order parameter [2,6,7]. It was predicted
theoretically and later observed experimentally, that a sharp
resonance peak in the dynamical spin susceptibility χ00ðQ; ωÞ
(magnetic resonance mode) may appear in the superconduct-
ing state at energy below 2Δ, due to creation particle-hole
pairs. This process is characterized by the coherence factor
½1 −ðϵqϵqþQ þ ΔqΔqþQÞ=EqEqþQ [8]. Here, Δq is the gap
function, ϵq the single particle dispersion, and Eq the
quasiparticle energy. The coherence factor vanishes if
the gap function has the same signs at the momenta at which
the particle-hole pairs are created Δq ¼ ΔqþQ, while it has a
finite values for Δq ¼ −ΔqþQ. Hence emergence of the
resonance mode in the superconducting state is a strong
evidence of a sign reversed order parameter [1–3,6,7,9–12].
Recently, it was pointed out that in the case of the sign
preserved order parameter there is a redistribution of the
magnetic spectral weight below Tc due to the opening of
superconducting energy gap in the spin excitation channel,
whichleadstoa nonresonance broadpeakabove2Δ [13–15].
Therefore the observation of the peak either below or above
2Δ allows identifying the relative sign of the order parameter
at the propagation vector. For example, the electron-pairing
symmetry in cuprates is ubiquitously d wave, which is
supported by the existence of a sharp magnetic resonant
mode at the “hot spot” wave vector below 2Δ [1,6,16].
In the case of iron-based superconductors, although no such
universal pairing symmetry has been identified, similar
resonant modes have also been observed in many systems

[2]. For most iron pnictide superconductors, the resonant
mode appears at the nesting wave vector (π, 0) between
hole Fermi surfaces at the zone center and electron Fermi
surfaces at the zone edge (1-Fe unit cell), indicating an
s-wave pairing with sign reversal gap function (s) between
electron and hole Fermi surfaces [3,17]. For the recently
discovered alkali-metal-intercalated iron-selenide supercon-
ductors AxFe2−ySe2 (A ¼ K; Rb; …) with no hole Fermi
surfaces at the zone center, the resonance wave vector
matches the nesting wave vector (π, 0.5π) between electron
Fermi surfaces at two adjacent zone edges, suggesting a d
wave or other types of s-wave pairing [18–28]. Although
the presence of a resonant mode is broadly consistent with a
spin-fluctuation mediated sign-reversed pairing symmetry,
several issues remain to be settled. First, the resonant modes
in some iron-based superconductors are broader than pre-
dicted in theories and appear at energy close to the super-
conducting gap edge where the requirements of the resonant
mode as a bound state below 2Δ cannot be unambiguously
confirmed [2]. Second, a few measurements yield contra-
dicting results regarding the phase of the superconducting
order parameter in different materials [12,18,29,30].
We use neutron scattering to study the effect of
isovalent S doping on the spin dynamics and its relation-
ship with superconductivity in KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2. Single
crystals
of
four
compositions
of
KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2
(z ¼ 0, Tc ¼ 31.2 K; z ¼ 0.25, Tc ¼ 32.0 K; z ¼ 0.4,
Tc ¼ 28.4 K; z ¼ 0.5, Tc ¼ 25.4 K) were prepared by
the self-flux method. The superconducting properties of
four single crystals were characterized with dc magnetic
susceptibility and resistivity measurements on small pieces
of crystals cut from large single crystals used for neutron
scattering experiments [31]. Our neutron diffraction refine-
ments suggest that the single crystals are phase separated
into a p5 × p5 iron vacancy ordered block AFM insulat-
ing phase and a superconducting phase with a 122 type
tetragonal crystal structure without static magnetic order,
consistent with earlier measurements [33]. S doping mono-
tonically reduces the lattice constants and Fe-Se=S bond
distances but does not change the symmetry of the crystal
structure. Actual chemical compositions are determined
by neutron and x-ray diffraction refinements. We note that
the K and Fe concentrations do not evolve rapidly under
S doping [31], which is consistent with the ARPES
measurements on the same batch of crystals that the carrier
concentration displays little change for all S-doped samples
measured [34]. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements
were carried out on the HB3 and HB1 thermal triple-axis
spectrometers at the High-Flux-Isotope Reactor (HFIR),
Oak
Ridge

Laboratory,
United
States,

IN8 thermal triple-axis spectrometer at the Institute

Zentrum
(MLZ),
Technische
Universität
München,
Garching, Germany, and the BT-7 thermal triple-axis
spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research
(NCNR), United States. The single crystals were aligned
in the (H, K, 0) scattering plane within ∼1.5 degrees
mosaicity for the measurements. We define the wave vector
Q at (qx,qy,qz) as ðh; k; lÞ ¼ ðqxa=2π; qyb=2π; qzc=2πÞ
reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) in the 1-Fe unit cell.
Figure 1 shows the detailed temperature dependent
energy scans at Q ¼ ð−0.5;0.77;0Þ for the undoped sample
(z ¼ 0, Tc ¼ 31.2 K). A prominent enhancement of the
scattering at around 13 meV is observed in the spin
excitation spectrum of the superconducting state [Fig. 1(a)],
which is similar to the resonant modes reported previously
[18,19]. This can be illustrated more clearly by eliminating
the energy-dependent background, by subtraction of the
signal at T ¼ 36 K from that in the superconducting state.
As shown in Fig. 1(b), the background subtracted contour
map exhibits a sharp resonant excitation (13 meV),
well below the superconducting gap (2Δ ¼ 20.6 meV) at
T ¼ 4 K. More interestingly, both the resonant mode (Ep)
and superconducting gap 2Δ hardly soften on heating and
undergo a sharp transition at Tc. This behavior differs from
the temperature dependence of a conventional weak cou-
pling BCS superconducting gap, which further implies the
unconventional nature of superconductivity in KxFe2−ySe2.
To determine the in-plane momentum structure of the
spin excitations as a function of S doping, we performed Q
scans for the z ¼ 0, 0.25, 0.4, and 0.5 samples below and
above the superconducting transition temperature Tc. In the
z ¼ 0 sample, strong magnetic excitations are observed
in the normal state near Q ¼ ð−0.5; 0.77; 0Þ [Fig. 2(a)],

in

[18,19,28].
Interestingly, the magnetic wave vector barely changes with
increasing S concentration up to 50% [Figs. 2(b)–2(d)].

Such doping independent magnetic wave vector is in line
with the ARPES measurements that Fermi surface geom-
etry in KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2 remains essentially unchanged
up to 80% S doping [34]. For all samples measured, the
magnetic excitations are enhanced on cooling below Tc.
Although the Tc is suppressed very slowly upon S doping,
the increase of the magnetic signal in the superconducting
state is clearly less pronounced at higher S concentrations.
Figure 3 illustrates the evolution of the resonant mode as a
function of S concentration. The background subtracted
energy scan (5–36 K) of the undoped sample (z ¼ 0) shows a
sharp resonant mode, below which a spin gap is also
observed due to the opening of the superconducting gap
[Fig. 3(a)]. We note that the magnitude of the spin gap
(Δs ≈10.2 meV) is much smaller than that of the super-
conducting gap because of the presence of the in-gap
resonant mode. The most interesting observation is that in
the z ¼ 0.25 sample, in addition to the resonant excitation
below 2Δ, the spectra exhibit a weak shoulder on the higher
energy side above 2Δ [Fig. 3(b)]. With increasing S con-
centration to z ¼ 0.4, the relative intensity of the resonant
mode decreases as the shoulder becomes more prominent
[Fig. 3(c)], and eventually the resonant mode is completely
replaced by a broad hump structure above 2Δ in the z ¼ 0.5
sample [Fig. 3(d)]. The magnitude of the spin gap at z ¼ 0.5
is very close to 2Δ, indicating that the scattering below the
superconducting gap is eliminated. The absence of magnetic
resonant mode below 2Δ and the pile up of states above 2Δ
suggest that the superconducting order parameter no longer
has the opposite sign between two adjacent electron Fermi
surfaces at this doping level. Indeed, a similar magnetic
fluctuation spectrum has been predicted in iron pnictides
assuming that the superconducting gap in electron and hole
Fermi surfaces possesses the same sign [13,15].
To confirm that the enhancement of the spin excitations in
the superconducting state is truly associated with super-
conductivity, we have measured the detailed temperature
dependence of the resonant mode and the hump structure
above 2Δ [Figs. 3(e)–3(h)]. The scattering of the resonant
mode at 13 meV displays an order-parameter-like behavior
with an onset at Tc, which proves a tight connection between
them [1,2,6]. Moreover, a similar temperature dependence of
the scattering of the hump or shoulder structure above 2Δ is
also observed [Figs. 3(j), 3(k), and 3(h)], suggesting that the
redistribution ofthe spectral weight across 2Δ is coupled with
the opening of the superconducting gap.
The doping dependence of the Tc, superconducting gap
(2Δ), and superconductivity-induced magnetic peak energy
(Ep) are summarized in Fig. 4. It is shown that the Tc exhibits
a small, but observable, increase from 31.2 K at z ¼ 0 to
32.0 K at z ¼ 0.25 followed by a gradual decrease to 25.4 K
at z ¼ 0.5 [Fig. 4(a)]. This is consistent with the phase
diagram reported previously [36]. On the other hand, the 2Δ
determined by ARPES measurements on the same batch of
samples showsa monotonicgradualdecreasewith increasing
S concentration [34]. The magnetic peak energy (Ep) barely
changes from z ¼ 0 to z ¼ 0.4 and suddenly shifts to higher
energy at z ¼ 0.5. For z ¼ 0, 0.25, and 0.4, the ratio Ep=2Δ
is close to the empirical universal ratio of ∼0.64 for magnetic
superconductors [37], which meets the requirement that the
resonant mode is a bound state below the superconducting
gap in a sign-reversed pairing state. This ratio jumps to 2.03
at z ¼ 0.5, which obviously violates the primary criteria of
the magnetic resonant mode [Fig. 4(b)]. It is interesting to
note that S doping changes the pairing symmetry, while it has
an insignificant impact on Tc. Two components in spin
excitation spectra, i.e., the sharp resonant mode below the 2Δ
and hump structure above 2Δ, are clearly observed at
z ¼ 0.25and0.4.Itisworthnotingthat ARPESandtransport
measurements have shown that S doping increases the
bandwidth and reduces the electron correlation considerably
but does not change the carrier concentration or Fermi
surface geometry, and that the superconducting gap remains
essentially isotropic under S doping [34,36,38].
We now discuss the possible mechanisms by which S
doping may influence the symmetry of the gap function.
First we discuss the proposal that S doping acts as non-
magnetic impurities. In contrast to cuprates where the
superconductivity is rapidly suppressed by a small amount
of nonmagnetic impurities in the CuO2 plane [16], iron
pnictides are much more robust against nonmagnetic
impurities [39]. In KxFe2−ySe2, superconductivity survives

up to 70% isovalent S doping [34,36]. This seems to
agree with theoretical calculations, which show that the
robustness of Tc is due to the multiband electron structure
and the effects of strong scattering [40–43]. Moreover,
nonmagnetic impurities may cause a transition from
the s pairing to sþþ pairing [40,41]. If this applies in
KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2, one would expect stabilizing of the
critical temperature after the transition, which was not
observed by the transport and ARPES measurements
[34,36]. Moreover, ARPES measurements show that spec-
tral weight distribution in momentum space has not been
disturbed by S doping significantly, indicating that the
effect of impurity scattering is negligible [34]. These results
suggest that the impurity effect is unlikely the predominant
underlying reason for the phase transition.
On the other hand, it has been suggested that a conven-
tional sign-preserved s-wave pairing could be realized in
the case of dominant orbital fluctuations which compete
with spin fluctuations [14,26]. Therefore, one may naively
suppose that for the low S doping spin fluctuations are
dominant, while for higher S doping orbital fluctuations
become more important. But in this situation a decrease of
Tc may be expected in the intermediate region, as the spin
fluctuations are compensated by the orbital fluctuations.
Contrarily, KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2 shows a maximum of Tc at
z ¼ 0.25. Hence, a more sophisticated mechanism, which
involves strong intraband interaction and orbital degree of
freedom should be considered. One of the possibilities is
the novel orbital-selective pairing state which has a conven-
tional s-wave form factor with a d-wave (B1g) pairing
symmetry [27,44]. In principle, in this scenario, pure
conventional s-wave or d-wave pairing could be achieved
by varying the orbital selectivity of the pairing interactions.
A decrease of the orbital-dependent renormalization in the
d orbitals is indeed observed in S-doped RbxFe2−ySe2 [38],
although it is currently unclear how S doping could change
the orbital selectivity of the exchange couplings in this
system.

To conclude, we have reported experimental evidence of
a transition from the sign-reversed to sign-preserved pairing
symmetry in KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2 iron-based superconduc-
tors. Superconductivity is relatively strong in terms of
Tc ¼ 25.4 K under 50% S doping, where the sign-
preserved pairing is dominant. This is difficult to explain
by simple weak coupling spin fluctuation-exchange pairing
theories. It is possible that KxFe2−yðSe1−zSzÞ2 is close to an
intermediate pairing state. The predominant effect of S
doping is to decrease progressively the electronic correla-
tions. This may, in turn, change the balance between
various fluctuations and pairing instabilities. Nevertheless,
our findings demonstrate that the pairing interactions are
sensitive to chemical doping. The observation of tunable
pairing symmetry may also reconcile the previously contra-
dictory data regarding the pairing symmetry in iron based
materials [12,18,29,30].
