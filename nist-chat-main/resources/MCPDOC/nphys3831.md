antiferromagnet

The quantum mechanical (Berry) phase of the electronic
wavefunction plays a critical role in the anomalous1,2 and
spin Hall eﬀects3,4, including their quantized limits5–7. While
progress has been made in understanding these eﬀects in
ferromagnets8, less is known in antiferromagnetic systems.
Here we present a study of antiferromagnet GdPtBi, whose
electronic structure is similar to that of the topologically
non-trivial HgTe (refs 9–11), and where the Gd ions oﬀer the
possibility to tune the Berry phase via control of the spin
texture. We show that this system supports an anomalous
Hall angle ΘAH > 0.1, comparable to the largest observed
in bulk ferromagnets12 and signiﬁcantly larger than in other
antiferromagnets13. Neutron scattering measurements and
electronic structure calculations suggest that this eﬀect
originates from avoided crossing or Weyl points that develop
near the Fermi level due to a breaking of combined time-
reversalandlatticesymmetries.Berryphaseeﬀectsassociated
with such symmetry breaking have recently been explored in
kagome networks14–17; our results extend this to half-Heusler
systems with non-trivial band topology. The magnetic textures

topological insulating and semimetallic states9–11,18,19 predicted
in this material class.
The ordinary Hall eﬀect is due to the Lorentz force bending
of charge carriers perpendicular to a magnetic field. In systems
where time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is spontaneously broken, it
typically can be overwhelmed by a diﬀerent class of mechanisms
for transverse velocity. In such systems, there are contributions
to transverse velocity from both extrinsic eﬀects due to spin-
dependent scattering13 and intrinsic eﬀects related to real space20,21
and momentum space2 Berry phase mechanisms. The former is
relevant in systems with non-coplanar spin textures with finite scalar
spin chirality χijk = Si · (Sj × Sk), where Sn are spins, while the
latter generically occurs in TRS-broken systems originating from the
spin–orbit-interaction-induced Berry curvature of the filled bands.
The anomalous Hall eﬀect (AHE) due to magnetic texture is most
often associated with finite χijk and tends to exhibit relatively small
anomalous Hall angles ΘAH ≲0.01 (such as SrFeO3 (ref. 22) or
Pr2Ir2O7 (ref. 23)), while intrinsic band-structure-based eﬀects are
common in ferromagnetic systems and can be significantly larger13.
Recent theoretical work has suggested that eﬀects that rely on both
magnetic texture and strong spin–orbit coupling may exist in non-
collinear antiferromagnets that lead to significant Hall responses14.
Single-crystal studies of Mn3Sn and Mn3Ge have been shown to
support ΘAH ≲0.02 and 0.05, respectively, originating from its
inverse triangular spin structure and electronic structure16,17.
Here we study single crystals of GdPtBi, a member of the
family RPtBi (R is a rare earth element) known to exhibit
antiferromagnetic ordering24. As shown in Fig. 1a, this system
has the half-Heusler structure consisting of interpenetrating face
centred cubic (fcc) lattices of each constituent element (space
group F¯43m) with lattice constant a = 6.68 Å for R= Gd. In
general, the antiferromagnetic fcc lattice is frustrated, with the
Gd ions forming a triangular lattice when viewed along the ⟨111⟩
direction. From the high-temperature magnetic susceptibility we
find a Curie–Weiss temperature θCW =−38 K, while the transition
to long-range magnetic order occurs at TN = 9.2 K, as shown in
Fig. 1b, consistent with previous reports24. This yields a moderate
frustration parameter f ≡−θCW/TN ∼4, similar to insulating
fcc systems FeO and MnSe25. As shown in Fig. 1c, high-field
torque magnetometry reveals a distinct kink at a magnetic field
BC ≈25 T (seen more clearly in d2τ/dB2, which is proportional to
the magnetic susceptibility), which is independent of orientation,
as shown in the inset of Fig. 1c. This is suggestive of field-
induced alignment of the spins and an energy scale gµBSBC =120 K,
where g = 2 is the g-factor, µB is the Bohr magneton, and
S=7/2 is the Gd spin (see Supplementary Information). This is
approximately three times larger than θCW, indicating cancelling
exchange interactions, as has been theoretically discussed for this
material26. The structure of the magnetic ordering in B = 0 has
recently been probed by X-ray and neutron scattering, which
suggests an antiferromagnetic ordering (type-II) in which the Gd
moments order ferromagnetically in sheets in the (111) planes,
which in turn are stacked antiferromagnetically27. Theoretical work
has suggested that other orderings are of comparable energy26; the
structure at finite B has not been previously reported.
The focus of the present study is the interplay of the magnetic
structure and strong spin–orbit coupling in GdPtBi. The heavy-
element PtBi sublattice is expected to provide the system with a
similar electronic structure to that of HgTe (refs 9–11), sensitive
to the magnetic ordering of the Gd ions through the spin–orbit
interaction. The bulk electronic structure of GdPtBi is known to
be semimetallic28. As shown in Fig. 1b, the observed resistivity
as a function of temperature ρ(T) has a moderate increase with
decreasing T, while at low temperature it shows a clear kink
concomitant with the magnetic transition at TN. A richer perspective
of the coupling of the conduction electrons to the magnetic order
is provided by magnetotransport. The longitudinal resistivity as a
function of magnetic field ρxx(B), with B along the [001] direction,
is shown in Fig. 2a. At temperatures T > TN we observe an
approximately quadratic dependence on B, indicating an average
mobility µavg ≈1,000 cm2 V−1 s−1. As T is lowered, we observe

a dip in ρxx that develops near B = 4 T, progressively deepening
to T =2.5 K. Measurements to B = 31 T (see Supplementary
Information) show that this is not related to Landau quantization,
as no continued pattern in B−1 connected to this feature is observed
with the appearance of Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations for
B>10 T.
The field dependence of the transverse resistivity ρyx(B) is shown
in Fig. 2b. At T =50 K we see a Hall eﬀect consistent with multiband
conduction, as would be expected from the electronic structure28.
Upon lowering T, we see a prominent feature develop in the
vicinity of B = 4 T, which corresponds to an enhancement in ρyx
of 55% at T = 2.5 K. This feature draws a distinct contrast with
the magnetization M. As shown in Fig. 2c, for T both above
and below TN, we see an approximately linear and featureless
M(B). In magnetic systems, it is conventional to describe three
separate contributions to ρyx = R0B + RSM + ρT
yx, where R0 is
the ordinary Hall coeﬃcient, RS is the anomalous Hall coeﬃcient
coupled to M, and ρT
yx is the Hall eﬀect arising from spin textures.
As described above, the final among these include non-coplanar
textures that generate finite χijk (refs 29–31) as well as non-collinear
textures that allow finite momentum-space Berry curvature14–17.
Structure in ρyx(B) from Berry phase eﬀects normally mirrors
that in M unless there are contributions related to spin texture.
Mathematical separation of these components is often performed
in the literature to isolate ρT
yx (ref. 32). Performing such analysis
we estimate ρT
yx = 0.18 m cm (see Supplementary Information),
significantly larger than has been previously reported in any
antiferromagnetic system, both in terms of absolute value and size
relative to ρxx (see Supplementary Information). We note that the
empirical relationship used for additivity of the contributions to
ρyx is valid only in the limit of small Hall angle, whereas at all
values of the Hall angle it is possible to discuss additivity in the
transverse conductivity σxy. Here we quantify the AHE using the
anomalous Hall angle ΘAH =σ A
xy/σxx =(σxy −σ N
xy)/σxx, where A(N)
denotes the anomalous (normal) part of the Hall conductivity. We
estimate σ N
xy by using σxy(T = 50 K), which is far above TN and
reflects the ordinary contribution to the Hall eﬀect, and refer to
the resulting anomalous Hall contribution as 1σxy, as shown in
Fig. 2e (similar behaviour is obtained by fitting the σ N
xy at large
B). The value of ΘAH peaks at more than 0.15 at B = 4 T, which
is larger than has been previously observed in antiferromagnetic
systems. A view of this transport response in the space of B and T is
shown in Fig. 3a. The region with the largest 1σxy, corresponding
to the peak feature we observe, occurs near B = 4 T and below
TN = 9.2 K. However, the anomalous Hall response persists to
significantly higher temperatures, with a reduced magnitude, finally
disappearing between 25 and 30 K.
The most common contribution of magnetic texture to the AHE
is that of finite χijk appearing in systems that have skyrmionic spin
textures stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction30,31. It
has also been recognized that frustrated magnets may play host
to similar texture-induced Hall eﬀects23. More recently, theoretical
work has suggested that, in antiferromagnets, a band-structure-
induced intrinsic AHE may arise in the presence of non-collinear
spin structures that break the combined time-reversal and lattice
symmetries of the simple antiferromagnetic state14. Such a situation
is realized in GdPtBi as the B = 0 type-II antiferromagnetic
spin structure cants in finite B. Neutron scattering measurements
confirm both the type-II ordering in fields up to 10 T (see
Supplementary Information) and a ferromagnetic canting, as
evidenced by an increase in intensity at the nuclear Bragg positions
with increasing B, as shown for (111) in Fig. 2d along with its scaling
with M 2. Additionally, an applied field produces an enhancement
in the magnetic Bragg peaks, as shown for (0.5 0.5 2.5) in Fig. 2d,
which saturates above 6 T, similar to the field scale for disappearance
of the anomalous Hall response. For antiferromagnetic systems

with such broken time-reversal and lattice symmetries and large

this requires the presence of a type-I magnetic ordering and finite
χijk, which is inconsistent with our neutron scattering measurements
(see Supplementary Information).
In terms of scaling of the AHE, we find a temperature-dependent
scaling factor α (defined as 1σxy ∼σ α
xx), as shown in Fig. 3c. At
low T, we find α = 1.2, intermediate between the value of 1.6
expected for the intrinsic AHE in multiband disordered metals34,35
and the σxx-invariant intrinsic AHE in moderately clean systems.
This crossover is predicted to occur in ferromagnets in the vicinity
of σxx ∼103 −1 cm−1, similar to the scale observed here. The
existence of frustrated magnetic interactions in GdPtBi, as shown
by the moderate value of f , suggests that short-range correlations
persist above TN (ref. 26); such correlations in the absence of long-
range order have been shown to aﬀect transport in PdCrO2 (ref. 36)
and Pr2Ir2O7 (ref. 23). We hypothesize that this extends to the
anomalous Hall eﬀect observed here, as such fluctuations will break
the same symmetry as the ordered phase, which is distinct from
that expected for Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn, where fluctuations due to
symmetric exchange cancel (see Supplementary Information).
To investigate the origin of the large AHE allowed in GdPtBi in
finite B, we consider the eﬀect of the spin texture on the electronic
structure. Band-touching points in the bulk electronic structure
of GdPtBi have been previously reported in calculations with an
uncanted magnetic structure37 which, if driven to anticrossings
near the Fermi level, could be a source of significant AHE
as in ferromagnetic systems35. We have performed electronic
structure calculations for magnetically ordered GdPtBi using the
rhombohedral magnetic unit cell shown in Fig. 4a. The approximate
location of EF is determined from the ordinary Hall eﬀect and kF
from SdH oscillations (see Supplementary Information), and the
B dependence of the spin structure is calculated using the results
of the magnetic and neutron scattering experiments. For B = 0
we find that the type-II ordered system exhibits band touching
at 0, as shown in Fig. 4b. The structures with spin canting for
B=4 T and 8 T along the [001] direction are shown in Fig. 4c and
d, respectively. The bands near the Fermi level originate from Pt
and Bi (see Supplementary Information). The combination of the
large spin–orbit coupling and critical band alignment of the system
amplifies the physical consequence of the Gd spin texture on these
bands; inspection of the band structure shows the development of
avoided crossings near EF which carry significant Berry curvature.
This suggests that the evolution of the electronic structure due to
spin texture will generate significant Berry phase contributions to
the AHE. The requirement that the combined symmetry of the
antiferromagnetic state be broken to observe the AHE necessitates
the application of finite B (ref. 14)—the calculations here indicate
that the particularly large response relies on the detailed band
structure of GdPtBi itself. We note that Weyl points have been
predicted to appear in the electronic structure of the HgTe class
compounds18, and can be a source of significant anomalous Hall
conductivity15,16,38. While such points do not appear along the
high-symmetry directions in the calculated structure, here they
may be expected to appear at other points in momentum space39.
If suﬃciently isolated Weyl points exist near EF, they may also
contribute to the AHE in a manner similar to avoided crossings
(magnetotransport possibly indicative of Weyl points is observed in
these crystals as shown in the Supplementary Information). Further
theoretical work is needed to determine if such conditions are met
in GdPtBi. More broadly, the symmetry-allowed momentum-space
Berry phase mechanism provides a consistent description for the
transport, scattering and calculation results presented herein.
It has been predicted that spin–orbit-driven band inversion in
the bulk of RPtBi may give rise to a topological insulating state9–11,
although thus far experiments using photoemission to probe the
band structure have been unable to resolve the topological nature
of the surface bands28. The symmetry-broken ground states known
to occur in RPtBi are then of heightened interest, as they would
be projected on to a potentially topologically non-trivial ground
state. The evolution of the bulk band structure is relevant to the
AHE presented here; the band topology of RPtBi provides a band
structure acutely sensitive to gap formation via the magnetic texture
and strong spin–orbit coupling of the system. Additionally, the
antiferromagnetic ordering itself has been predicted to give rise to
a new type of topological insulating state where a combined time-
reversal and translational symmetry is the source of protection for
the surface modes19, a scenario further enriched by the observations
here. This highlights GdPtBi as a candidate platform not only for
hosting topological edge modes in the antiferromagnetic state19, but
also as a novel TRS-broken topological insulator with non-collinear
spin texture in finite B (ref. 6).
The combination of spin–orbit and correlation eﬀects is expected
to reveal new behaviour beyond that possible for single-electron
physics. Here, the combination of strong spin–orbit coupling and
symmetry breaking probed by neutron scattering gives rise to an
extremely large anomalous Hall response that connects to recent
theories for emerging eﬀects in antiferromagnetic systems14 and
the calculated electron structure. This eﬀect and its scaling with
conductivity12 provide an antiferromagnetic example to generalize
the notion of phase-space Berry phase eﬀects in TRS-broken
systems40. Furthermore, it provides an example of a robust AHE
driven by the combined role of spin–orbit coupling and spin texture
that demonstrates the ubiquity of the Berry phase mechanism in
symmetry-broken systems.

Methods
Single crystals of GdPtBi were grown using a flux method following ref. 24. A
mixture of 99.99% Pt wire, 99.9% pure Gd, and 99.999% Bi needles in a molar ratio
of 1:1:20 was put in an alumina crucible and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube
with 0.016 MPa Argon gas. The sample was heated at 1,100 ◦C for 2 h and then
cooled slowly between 900 ◦C and 600 ◦C at a rate of 2 ◦C h−1, followed by
centrifuging to dissociate the GdPtBi crystals from the Bi flux. For neutron
scattering experiments, 97.7% isotope-enriched 160Gd (with a purity of 99.9%) was
used. All the obtained crystals were confirmed to be of single phase by a powder
X-ray diﬀraction method. The crystals were aligned by X-ray Laue back-reflection
and/or single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction techniques. Transport measurements were
performed with a conventional four-probe method. To correct for contact
misalignment, the measured longitudinal and transverse voltages were field
symmetrized and antisymmetrized, respectively. Magnetization measurements
were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) magnetometer. Torque magnetometry was performed using a BeCu
cantilever, with the deflection detected by a capacitance bridge. Neutron scattering
measurements were carried out on the triple-axis spectrometer BT-7 at the NIST
Center for Neutron Research41. Electronic structure calculations were performed
using the projector augmented wave method and exchange–correlation potential
with the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
parameters, implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package42.
