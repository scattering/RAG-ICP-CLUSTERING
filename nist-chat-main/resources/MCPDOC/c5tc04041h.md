We report the phase diagram for the superconducting system (7Li1xFexOD)FeSe and contrast it with that
of (Li1xFexOH)FeSe both in single crystal and powder forms. Samples were prepared via hydrothermal
methods and characterized by laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction, high-resolution neutron
powder diﬀraction (NPD), and high intensity NPD. We find a correlation between the tetragonality of the
unit cell parameters and the critical temperature, Tc, which is indicative of the eﬀects of charge doping
on the lattice and formation of iron vacancies in the FeSe layer. We observe no appreciable isotope
eﬀect on the maximum Tc in substituting H by D. The NPD measurements definitively rule out an
antiferromagnetic ordering in the non-superconducting (Li1xFexOD)FeSe samples below 120 K, which
has been reported in non-superconducting (Li1xFexOH)FeSe. A likely explanation for the observed
antiferromagnetic transition in (Li1xFexOH)FeSe samples is the formation of impurities during their
preparation such as Fe3O4 and LixFeO2, which express a charge ordering transition known as the Verwey
transition near 120 K. The concentration of these oxide impurities is found to be dependent on the
concentration of the lithium hydroxide reagent and the use of H2O vs. D2O as the solvent during
synthesis. We also describe the reaction conditions that lead to some of our superconducting samples
to exhibit ferromagnetism below Tc.
Introduction
In the iron-based pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors,
chemical doping and physical pressure are universal variables
for tuning the superconducting properties.2,3 For example,
the critical temperature, Tc, of 8 K in FeSe under ambient
conditions4–7 can be increased to 38 K by externally applied
pressure8,9 or 44 K by intercalation of cationic species.10–13
The tetragonal (P4/nmm) structure of FeSe (Fig. 1) consists
of sheets of edge-sharing FeSe4 tetrahedra held together by
van der Waals interactions, which makes it an ideal host for
intercalation chemistry. Negative pressure, or strain, has also
been implicated as a parameter in the high Tc range of 65–100 K
reported for single layered FeSe.14–16
Given the propensity of the FeSe layered system for chemical
and physical manipulation, FeSe is an ideal platform for under-
standing the superconductivity of the iron-based systems
and for the preparation of new layered functional materials.
The recently discovered (Li1xFexOH)FeSe system,1,17–21 which
contains layers of LiOH alternating with layers of FeSe (Fig. 1),
offers such an opportunity. Iron may occupy the lithium site
and therefore effectively charge dope the FeSe layer since
(Li1xFexOH) would be positively charged. Sun et al. have also

reported that increased lithiation of the (Li1xFexOH) layer
would force iron to occupy vacancies in the FeSe layer, which
can be detrimental to the superconducting properties.18
Three outstanding issues in the (Li1xFexOH)FeSe system
and related phases are whether (1) an antiferromagnetic parent
phase exists, (2) superconductivity coexists with ferromagnet-
ism, and (3) any isotope eﬀects on Tc exist. Critical to answering
all three questions is the preparation of the deuteroxide version
of (Li1xFexOH)FeSe and constructing its phase diagram.
Furthermore, hydrothermal synthesis under either H2O or D2O
presents interesting diﬀerences in the purity of the resulting
superconducting phases due to diﬀerences in the reaction
kinetics. Thus, this study will help workers in the field under-
stand the thermodynamic and kinetic factors in the preparation
of phase pure and superconducting FeSe-based materials.
Experimental
Sample preparation
The preparation of powder samples was achieved by modifying
a hydrothermal route reported in the literature.1,22 Due to the
high neutron absorption cross section of 6Li, our compounds were
prepared doubly isotopically pure to form (7Li1xFexOD)FeSe. For
the synthesis of deuterated samples we first prepared the doubly
isotopically pure 7LiOD as a precursor. 7LiOD was prepared by
mixing a stoichiometric amount of 7LiCO3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99% for
7Li) and CaO (calcined from CaCO3, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) in D2O.
The CaCO3 precipitate was filtered, and 7LiOD crystallized by
evaporation of the solvent.
For a typical preparation of (Li1xFexOD)FeSe, 5 mmol of Fe
powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), 6 mmol of selenourea (Sigma
Aldrich, 98%) and 50 mmol of LiOD powder were suspended in
5 mL of distilled D2O (Oxford Isotope, 99.9%).‡ The mixture was
placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 120–200 1C
for 3–5 days. Afterwards, the autoclave was opened in an
argon-filled glove bag, and the shiny black precipitate was
washed with D2O. The product was washed and centrifuged
several times until the supernatant was clear. The remaining
product was collected, vacuum dried, and stored in a nitrogen-
filled glovebox. The yield of the product was usually between
50% and 70%.
Single crystal (Li1xFexOD)FeSe and (Li1xFexOH)FeSe samples
were prepared by replacing potassium cations with LiOD or LiOH
from KxFe2ySe2 single crystals under hydrothermal conditions
similar to those reported by Dong et al.23 For the growth of the
KxFe2ySe2 single crystals, 1.8 g (13 mmol) of FeSe powder was
mixed with 0.21 g (5.4 mmol) of potassium metal (Alfa Aesar,
99%) to match the nominal composition of K0.8Fe2Se2.24,25 The
FeSe precursor was prepared by heating Fe (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) and
Se (Alfa Aesar, 99%) powders to 700 1C for 5 h followed by furnace
cooling; the resulting phase does not need to be of the tetragonal
b-FeSe form for the crystal growth. The FeSe/K mixtures were
loaded in a quartz ampoule inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox,
and the ampoules were flame sealed under vacuum. In order to
avoid breaking of the ampoule resulting in oxidation of the
samples due to potassium-induced corrosion of the quartz walls,
the sample container was sealed in a larger ampoule. For crystal
growth of KxFe2ySe2, the mixture was heated to 1030 1C over
10 h and held at 1030 1C for 3 hours to form a homogeneous
melt. Subsequently, the melt was slowly cooled at a rate of
6 1C hour1 to 650 1C to allow crystal growth. After cooling to
room temperature, KxFe2ySe2 single crystals approximately 8 mm
in diameter were recovered.
In order to compare the eﬀect of D2O to the reaction kinetics,
single crystals of both (Li1xFexOH)FeSe and (Li1xFexOD)FeSe
were prepared under identical hydrothermal conditions. For the
preparation of (Li1xFexOH)FeSe single crystals, the KxFe2ySe2
precursor (0.2–0.4 g), 0.14 g (2.5 mmol) of Fe powder, and 2 g
(47 mmol) of LiOH monohydrate were added to 5 mL of water.
For (Li1xFexOD)FeSe single crystals, to match the concentration
of LiOH in water, 1.2 g (47 mmol) of LiOD and 6 mL of D2O were
used for reactions. The mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave at 120–200 1C for 4–5 days. Silver colored
single crystals were recovered by washing away excess powder
with water and drying under vacuum overnight. The as-recovered
single crystals retained similar shape to the starting KxFe2ySe2
single crystals.
Samples prepared in the absence of excess iron powder were
not superconducting, which could be due to either oxidation of
the iron or vacancy formation in the FeSe layer. To study the
role of metal powders in the cation exchange reactions, experi-
ments using Sn metal (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) instead of Fe powder
for the preparation of (Li1xFexOH)FeSe and (Li1xFexOD)FeSe
single crystals at 120 1C were carried out. Sn can react with hot
concentrated bases to form soluble [Sn(OH)6]2+ species while
evolving H2 gas,26 thus providing a stronger reducing environ-
ment than the hydrothermal reactions without the presence of
metal powders.
Laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction measurements
Room temperature powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) data were
collected on a Bruker D8 X-ray diﬀractometer (Cu Ka radiation,
l = 1.5418 Å). Data were collected with a step size of 0.021
between 71 and 701 for Pawley fits to extract lattice constants
and 71 and 1201 for Rietveld fits to obtain more accurate lattice
and structural parameters.
In order to find any possible crystallographic phase transi-
tions that are coupled to either the superconducting or magne-
tization order parameters, temperature dependent (5–300 K)
high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction was carried out
for powders of ground single crystals at Beamline 11-BM at the
Advanced Photon Source (APS). In addition to finding subtle
changes in symmetry due to peak splitting, the synchrotron
measurements provide high-Q data and therefore more accurate
structural parameters. Analysis of the high-Q reflections helps
in determining any small changes in the iron occupancies in
both the FeSe and LiOH layers, which could affect Tc’s of the
sample as suggested by Sun et al.18 An Oxford helium cryostat

(closed flow system) was used to reach a temperature that is
close to liquid helium (E4 K).
Ground powders of single crystals were packed in 0.4 mm
Kapton capillary tubes and sealed with epoxy. Diﬀraction data
were collected between 0.51 and 461 with a step size of 0.00011
using a constant wavelength l = 0.413964 Å (30 keV).
Magnetization measurements
Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a
magnetic property measurement system (Quantum Design MPMS).
Both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetic suscepti-
bility measurements were taken from 2–300 K in direct current
mode with an applied magnetic field of 1 or 3 mT.
Neutron powder diﬀraction measurements
All the neutron work was carried out with doubly isotopically
pure samples (7Li1xFexOD)FeSe at the NIST Center for Neutron
Research (NCNR). The samples were loaded into He-filled
vanadium cans and subsequently into a closed cycle refrigerator
for low temperature measurements. Low temperature (4 K) diﬀrac-
tion data were collected on the BT-1 high-resolution NPD with
the Cu(311) monochromator (l = 1.540 Å). In addition to base
temperature measurements, we performed NPD measurements
at various temperatures 25 K, 75 K, 150 K, and room temperature
to search for any crystallographic phase transitions.
High-intensity and coarse-resolution diﬀraction measurements
were carried out on the BT-7 spectrometer (l = 2.359 Å) using
the position sensitive detector (PSD) to search for magnetic
Bragg peaks from base temperature up to 150 K.27
Results
Crystallography and phase diagram
Rietveld refinements with both XRD and NPD data were carried
out using the TOPAS 4.2 software.28 Representative fits to one
of the deuteroxide samples are presented in Fig. 2 for both
laboratory X-rays and neutrons. Although the samples are
mostly phase pure, some starting reagent Li2CO3 was found
as an impurity in the neutron data, which is more of a bulk
technique than X-ray diﬀraction. Furthermore, two very broad
peaks could be indexed as close to the lattice parameters of
the parent phase b-FeSe. Indeed, these peaks have also been
observed in previous work.17,19 The much broader peak width
for the FeSe impurity is indicative of very small crystallite size
and quantitatively fitting this phase is not possible given its
nearly amorphous nature.
The temperature-dependent synchrotron diﬀraction data did
not reveal any major crystallographic changes in the structure
(Fig. 3). Therefore, unlike the parent FeSe phase, which under-
goes a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition near 75 K,29
LiOHFeSe and LiODFeSe remain tetragonal down to base tempera-
ture (10 K). Rietveld refinements of one of the deuteroxide patterns
at 7 K and 150 K are presented in Fig. 3, and relevant structural
parameters are in Table 1 for both superconducting and non-
superconducting deuteroxide phases. Relevant bond distances
and bond angles are also shown in Table 1. Only results from
the synchrotron X-ray dataset are presented in Table 1, and
structural parameters from the Rietveld refinements, including

NPD, indicating lack of antiferromagnetic ordering. Weight percent fractions
from structural refinements are as follows: 98% (7Li1xFexOD)FeSe (gold ticks)
and 2% Li2CO3 (green ticks). A few broad peaks corresponding to FeSe were fit
by a LeBail routine (asterisk).

tetragonal P4/nmm. Tick marks representing the tetragonal phase are
shown below the calculated, observed, and diﬀerences curves. The insets

the neutron data, for the rest of the samples used to construct
the full phase diagrams can be found in the ESI† (Tables S1–S5).
Magnetization results and the phase diagrams
The SQUID magnetic susceptibility measurements for the series
of hydroxide samples prepared through the powder routes are
presented in Fig. 4a. The deuteroxide samples, which were all
derived from the single crystal route, are shown in Fig. 4b. Only
one sample within the hydroxide series expressed a ferro-
magnetic signal within the superconducting regime. Although
some studies have found no evidence of ferromagnetism below
Tc in their samples,1,20 under suitable synthesis conditions, we
have observed a ferromagnetic signal in the superconducting
regime as first reported by Pachmayr et al.17 A similar plot
(Fig. S1, ESI†) for the hydroxide system prepared via the single
crystal route can be found in the ESI.†
We have constructed superconducting phase diagrams in
Fig. 5 that relate the critical temperatures Tc to the lattice
constants compiled from the SQUID data and diﬀraction
results from all the samples. The lattice parameters of the
tetragonal unit cell found at room temperature were used as
the x-axis versus Tc in the phase diagrams. More specifically, we
found that the best correlation with Tc is that of the tetragonality
parameter, which is the simple c/a ratio. The corresponding
superconducting volume fractions (4pw) were also established by
SQUID magnetometry (Fig. 4).
We found that Tc and its volume fraction increased with the
lattice constant c and decreased with the lattice constant a.
Therefore, those with the highest tetragonality gave the
maximum Tc and superconducting volume fractions. For sam-
ples to exhibit significant superconducting volume fractions
(4pw 4 10%), the lattice constant c must be larger than B9.20 Å
and a smaller than B3.80 Å. These trends in the lattice
parameters are consistent with the findings of Sun et al. on
their hydroxide analogues,18 where they attribute a large a lattice
constant to iron vacancies in the FeSe layers and therefore iron
slightly oxidized above 2+.
Our combined diﬀraction experiments did indeed find
variations on the iron occupancies, whether superconducting
or non-superconducting. As Table 1 shows, when the occupancy
of the Fe2 site falls from near full to 91.9(2)%, superconductivity
is lost. The diﬀerences overall between the hydroxide samples
prepared by powder routes and the single crystal ones could
be due to the accommodation of iron vacancies during

the syntheses. As Sun et al. found in their samples,18 when FeSe
in its tetragonal b-phase is used as the host for intercalation
via hydrothermal synthesis, iron powder is necessary as a
co-reagent in order to fill in the resulting vacancies. When starting
with Fe powder and selenourea, we found more variability in
the amount of iron vacancies and therefore a larger spread in
the tetragonality parameter (Fig. 5). Our powder preparation
therefore can be described as in situ growth of alternating FeSe
and Li1xFexOD layers whereas our single crystal preparation
is a post-synthetic modification method (also known as soft
chemistry).
Neutron results
To verify whether any of the samples exhibit antiferromagnet-
ism, we searched for any superlattice peaks in the NPD patterns
that could arise below 120 K, the AFM transition in the parent
phase of (Li1xFexOD)FeSe reported by Dong et al.1 No super-
lattice reflections were observed in the BT-1 high-resolution
NPD patterns, and our deuterated samples allowed for a low
background in case of a small Fe signal. Indeed, in the arsenide
systems the iron moment can be small in the parent phases
such as 0.36(5) mB per Fe in LaOFeAs30 and 0.25(7) mB per Fe in
NdOFeAs,31 and any hydrogen incoherent background would
easily overwhelm such a small signal from long-range magnetic
ordering in the NPD.
The samples were measured up to 150 K on BT-1, and no
long range magnetic ordering was observed. NPD patterns
taken using a PSD on BT-7, which has a much higher flux than
BT-1 at low angles, also revealed no antiferromagnetic peaks in
the non-superconducting samples (Fig. 6). Diﬀerence patterns
between 150 K and 4 K are shown in Fig. 6, revealing no residual
intensity and only diﬀerences arising from thermal expansion
and thus peak positions.
Discussion
Relationship between structural parameters and
superconductivity
In preparing our deuteroxide samples, we found the reaction
temperature to influence the lattice constants. Mild hydrothermal
reaction temperatures (120 1C) led to samples expressing a higher
Tc, while the reaction temperature above 180 1C led exclusively to
either non-superconducting samples or ones with very low volume
fractions (4pw o 1%). Reaction times also aﬀected the lattice
constants. Longer reaction times (43 days) yielded samples
with slightly larger a and smaller c (i.e. smaller tetragonality
parameters).
While all the deuterated samples followed the trend shown
in the phase diagram (Fig. 5c), similarly prepared hydrated
samples deviated in their behaviour. Indeed, some hydroxide
samples with lattice parameters matching those in the phase
diagram from an earlier literature report1 did not exhibit
superconductivity (Fig. 4a).
Interestingly, samples prepared at lower temperatures with
the described mixing ratio and longer reaction times expressed
coexistence between superconductivity and ferromagnetism
(Fig. 3a). Thus, while longer reaction times above 180 1C led
to lower Tc’s or non-superconducting samples, longer reaction
times at lower temperatures (120 1C) produced a ferromagnetic
signal in superconducting (Li1xFexOD)FeSe. As described
in the next section, this might be a kinetic eﬀect from

parison with that of (b) single crystal (7Li1xFexOD)FeSe and (c) powder
samples and (Li1xFexOD)FeSe. The critical temperatures Tc are related to
the tetragonality parameter, which is the simple ratio of the lattice para-
meters c/a. Note that for the single crystal samples, the crystals exhibited a
superconducting phase fraction typically larger than 100%, likely due to the
geometry of the crystals.

the increasing amount of oxidized iron in water from longer
reaction times.
Relationship between magnetism and superconductivity
In several of our non-superconducting samples, we have observed
an antiferromagnetic transition close to 120 K. Dong et al. have
claimed that the hydroxide samples in the non-superconducting
dome were antiferromagnetic parent phases with a TN close to
120 K, and therefore that the selenides and arsenides have the
same underlying physics with respect to the superconducting
mechanism. This is a very important claim that could have large
implications in the field of iron-based superconductors. None
of our non-superconducting deuteroxide samples, however,
exhibited this antiferromagnetic signal in the SQUID measure-
ments, which led us to believe that antiferromagnetism may
not be intrinsic to this system.
Our findings in the preparation of hydroxide and deuteroxide
samples revealed the strong possibility that the 120 K transition
observed in the SQUID magnetization measurements arises from
iron oxide impurities. The so-called Verwey transition, which
corresponds to a Fe2+/Fe3+ charge ordering transition in Fe3O4,
also occurs near 120 K.32,33 Furthermore, structurally related
LixFeO2 phases can express TN from 100 K to 300 K according to
the amount of intercalated lithium cations.34,35
In order to study the formation of iron oxide impurities, a
sample was prepared under similar hydrothermal conditions
but without the addition of selenourea. As pointed out by
Sun et al.18 in their extensive study of the formation of
(Li1xFexOH)FeSe, the strongly basic conditions (pH 4 14) of
the synthesis strongly favour the formation of Fe3+ species
according to the electrochemical-pH phase equilibrium diagram
(i.e. Pourbaix) of iron.36 Therefore, without the selenourea reagent
to stabilize Fe2+ species, a large amount of mixed valent iron oxides
are produced under hydrothermal and highly basic conditions.
The XRD pattern of the as-recovered sample from hydro-
thermal synthesis without selenourea was fit by the Fe3O4
structure, and its magnetic susceptibility measurement was in
very good agreement with typical Verwey transition at 120 K
(Fig. 7a and b). As shown in Fig. 7c, a (Li1xFexOH)FeSe sample
with lattice constants in the supposed superconducting region
displayed no super-conductivity, but a transition similar to charge
ordering in Fe3O4. Peaks in the XRD pattern (indicated by * in
Fig. 7b) that cannot be matched with the (Li1xFexOH)FeSe phase
were indexed well with the strongest peaks of Fe3O4. In addi-
tion, our synchrotron XRD data for a non-superconducting
(Li1xFexOH)FeSe single crystal sample revealed small amounts
of Fe3O4 impurity (Fig. S2, ESI†), which were not observed in
laboratory X-ray measurements. Therefore, it is likely that the
120 K transition in non-superconducting (Li1xFexOH)FeSe
samples is extrinsic and due to magnetic impurities Fe3O4 or
structurally related LixFeO2.
Hydrothermal synthesis of samples with D2O under similar
conditions as those with H2O did not lead to appreciable oxide
impurity. We therefore conclude that the observed diﬀerences
in the acid–base chemistry of H2O and D2O lead to different
products for similar reaction conditions. Indeed, a hydrothermal
treatment of iron powder with D2O and with LiOD did not lead to
complete conversion to Fe3O4 but left unreacted iron powder
(approximately 50%). Since under highly basic conditions, Fe3+
should be favoured thermodynamically, we believe that the
kinetics for the oxidation of iron with D2O is slower than in
H2O due to the stronger D–O bond than the H–O bond.
All deuteroxide single crystal samples prepared in D2O
showed noticeably higher Tc’s than their hydroxide counterparts
prepared under identical conditions (Table S2, ESI†). The Tc of
hydroxide samples can be improved by reducing the reaction
time, which likely minimizes the extent of Fe oxidation.
Although we have established here that the (Li1xFexOH)FeSe
system does not likely have a parent antiferromagnetic phase, we
do not suggest that the chalcogenide-based superconductors are
not linked to the arsenide-based ones. The Fe1+xTeyCh1y for
Ch = Se and S phases, for example, exhibits a rich magnetic
phase diagram37,38 before superconductivity sets in with chemical
substitution.39 The ordered vacancy phase of K0.8Fe1.6Se2 has also
shown an antiferromagnetic transition at high temperatures
(B559 K)40 while the disordered vacancy phase exhibits a Tc
close to 30 K.41–45 What distinguishes those two systems,
however, from the present compound and FeSe, is the lack of
a large magnetic moment on iron in the latter compounds.46–51
In Fe1+xTe it can be as large as 2 mB
52 and in K0.8Fe1.6Se2 as large
as 3.3(1) mB.40
As to the ferromagnetic transition observed at B10 K in the
sample with a Tc of 34 K, several authors have also observed it
in the hydroxide analogues. Pachmeyer et al. attribute the long
range magnetic order at 18 K to the iron cations partially
substituted on the Li site,17 while Lu et al. assign this transition

as being antiferromagnetic (B12 K) according to their NMR
studies.19 Our recent small angle neutron scattering study
illustrates the formation of long-range magnetic order below
12.5 K, but with a moment too small to see with diﬀraction.22
This observation likely arises from the dilute occupancy by the
iron cation on the Li site.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully mapped out a phase diagram
for (Li1xFexOD)FeSe and have found that the highest Tc for
deuterated samples is 42 K, and the Tc for both deuterated and
hydroxide samples correlate with lattice constants. From syn-
chrotron and neutron diﬀraction studies, iron vacancies in the
FeSe layer seem to lead to the low tetragonality ratio. The phase
diagram of our samples therefore shows a dome-like appearance
for the superconducting regime, which had not been observed
before.1,18 Since the presence of more vacancies implies a higher
oxidation state for iron, the samples with optimal Tc do suggest
that an optimal electron doping is also necessary for the selenide
system. Since the highest Tc observed for the hydroxide sample
was also approximately 42 K, we conclude that there is no
isotope eﬀect on the superconducting properties in substituting
H by D. Mild hydrothermal preparation (120 1C) for long reaction
times can lead to the coexistence of ferromagnetism and super-
conductivity. Finally, any claims of anti-ferromagnetism in the
parent phase of this system should be re-evaluated in light of the
easy preparation of oxide impurities with transition tempera-
tures near the vicinity of 120 K in H2O.
